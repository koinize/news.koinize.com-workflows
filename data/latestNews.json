Decentralized applications volumes surged, but there's a catch.</p>\n                    <p><p>Solana's native token, SOL (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>), hit its highest point in 23 months on March 1, and is currently trading up 34.5% in one week. While Solana maintains its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins, it has been narrowing the gap with the third-place competitor, BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>). The key question is what fueled SOL's rally, and, critically, can this outperformance compared to competitors be sustained?</p><p>SOL’s price had been attempting to solidify the $100 support over the past couple of months. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to claim that the bull run commenced before Feb. 23. In reality, SOL experienced a modest 2% increase between Dec. 23, 2023, and Feb. 23, 2023, whereas Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) witnessed a 25.5% uptick during the same period, and Tron (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tron-price-index\">TRX</a>) achieved gains of 31.5%. Essentially, whatever triggered the decoupling in favor of SOL occurred in the past week.</p><p>In addition to the substantial gains on SOL, a few Solana SPL memecoins saw a notable surge in demand in the past week. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 110% increase since Feb. 23, while DogWifHat (WIF) experienced a significant rally of 250% during the same period. It's worth noting that this trend wasn't confined to Solana network tokens alone, as Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also registered gains of around 51% since Feb. 23. However, it is likely that some of this demand spilled over from these popular tokens, impacting SOL, as traders sought gains on decentralized exchange’s (DEX) listings.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-gains-34-5-percent-week-network-metrics-support-further-gains\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Oliver Michel, founder and CEO of German-based venture capitalist firm Tokentus Investment AG, has given a bullish price prediction for the XRP price. According to him, XRP could hit $10 soon enough.  XRP Price To $10 Is Just The Beginning Michel mentioned during an interview with Der Aktionär, a leading German finance magazine, that he expects XRP to rise to between $5 and $10 in the first wave of its parabolic move to the upside. Interestingly, he added that XRP would eventually hit three to four figures and didn’t seem worried about XRP’s current price action.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Rallies 50% To Beat Out Avalanche, BONK Overtakes PEPE Meanwhile, Michel revealed that he is invested in the XRP tokens as he has them both in his family office and with his company, Tokentus. The same applies to Ripple shares, which he stated he purchased through an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle).  Michel is no stranger to the XRP ecosystem, considering that his company partnered with Ripple last year in an effort to grow and increase the adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). During the interview, Michel also offered his thoughts on Ripple as a “professional company” and sounded so bullish on what the crypto firm was building with its Payment service.  He used the opportunity to elaborate further on how Ripple was simplifying cross-border transactions with the help of the XRPL and XRP tokens. Ripple is known to settle these transactions through its blockchain, with XRP serving as the utility token, and these XRP tokens are then converted to the fiat currency of the recipient&#8217;s choice.  XRP To Become The “World Reserve Bridge Currency” Michel stated that XRP could become the “world reserve bridge currency” once countries implement their CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency). Ripple’s XRPL is already being touted as the go-to chain for CBDC settlements. The crypto firm had also revealed that they were already actively working with more than 20 Central banks on CBDC initiatives.  Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Why Bitcoin Can Rise To $400,000 The Tokentus founder also believes it won’t be long before other Central banks fall back on Ripple to help them implement their CBDCs. He noted that the pressure was piling up on these banks to act now to avoid an impending economic collapse. XRP is expected to play an integral role when this all happens.  Ripple’s XRPL also looks set to act as the intermediary between all these CBDCs when the time comes. Bitcoinist once reported how the network’s clawback feature boosts the prospects of CBDCs being implemented on it.  At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.58, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  XRP at $0.58 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"
