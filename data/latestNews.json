Binance has removed Banco de Venezuela, one of the largest banks in the country, as a payment method on its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading service, in efforts to comply with international financial sanctions. Meanwhile, Shibarium, the new layer-2 blockchain launched by the developers of Shiba Inu <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index\">(SHIB)</a> has reached a new wallet and transaction milestone just hours after relaunching its bridge to the public.</p><p>A United States Court of Appeals has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">sided with Grayscale</a> in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a major victory in the crypto asset manager’s pursuit of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p><p>On Aug. 29, the U.S. District Court of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC was wrong in rejecting Grayscale’s application to convert its GBTC fund into a Bitcoin ETF. Previously, Grayscale’s attempt to launch an ETF application was rejected by the regulator because it supposedly was not “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"> JUST IN <br><br>The D.C.

However, the ruling could factor into the SEC’s deliberations on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-2024\">several outstanding Bitcoin ETF applications</a>, including those filed by BlackRock, Fidelity and WisdomTree. </p><h3>Grayscale clears major hurdle in pursuit of Bitcoin ETF</h3><h3>Binance excludes Banco de Venezuela from P2P payments</h3><p>The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has removed Banco de Venezuela as a payment method on its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading service. This follows similar moves with sanctioned Russian banks last week and is likely part of efforts to fall in line with international financial sanctions.</p><p>According to Venezuelan users, Banco de Venezuela has vanished from the P2P payments options this week, following a series of such removals of Russian banks by Binance. The obvious reason behind this step is the Aug. 24 Wall Street Journal report about the exchange’s participation in circumventing international financial sanctions.</p><p>Banco de Venezuela is one of the largest financial institutions in the country — according to the available stats from the end of the 2000s, it held third spot with over 11% share of the local market. In 2009, it was sold to the state by a private holding company, Grupo Santander, for about $1 billion. The sanctions in response to the repression of the 2014 and 2017 protests were imposed on Venezuelan government officials and affiliated institutions by the United States Treasury Department in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>As local media reported, private Venezuelan banks, such as Banesco, Banplus, BBVA Provincial and others, remain on the list of Binance’s P2P platform.</p><p>The recent surge in awareness regarding the inclusion of sanctioned banks on crypto P2P payment options came to light last week when The Wall Street Journal revealed that Tinkoff Bank and Sberbank were featured as transfer methods on Binance. The same day, Tinkoff and Sberbank were no longer visible on the Binance P2P platform, although the options colored “yellow” and “green,” representative of their respective brand colors, remained. On Aug. 25, journalists confirmed that the sanctioned banks had been entirely removed from the list, citing a spokesperson from Binance.</p><p>On Aug. 28, two other major crypto exchanges, OKX and Bybit, followed Binance by excluding sanctioned Russian banks from their payment options.</p><h3>Shibarium wallets surpass 100K after SHIB devs relaunch bridge</h3><p>Shibarium, a new layer-2 blockchain for Shiba Inu has surpassed 100,000 wallets on its platform with 35,000 coming within 24 hours of Shibarium's relaunch on Aug. 28.</p><p>Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer and co-founder of Shiba Inu, <a href=\"https://blog.shib.io/shibariumupdatefinal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">confirmed</a> Shibarium was back up and running in an Aug. 28 blog post.</p><p>At the time, Kusama noted that Shibarium tallied 65,000 wallets across 350,000 transactions — however, Shibarium’s block explorer now <a href=\"https://www.shibariumscan.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">shows</a> that 101,277 wallets have now facilitated 420,897 transactions across 344,614 blocks, with an average block time of 5 seconds.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">100k wallets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shibarium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Shibarium</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIBARMYSTRONG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SHIBARMYSTRONG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jXJL441kgR\">pic.twitter.com/jXJL441kgR</a></p>&mdash; Tanzeel - Summer of Shibarium (@TanzeelSHIB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TanzeelSHIB/status/1696229211604766879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Shibarium stumbled into issues not long after going live on Aug. 16. </p><p>At the time of the outage, Kusama blamed the “MASSIVE influx of transitions and users” when it went live, and later said it found a case where “thousands upon thousands of contract creation and normal transactions” in one block — which led it going into fail-safe mode.</p><p>It is estimated that about <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/shibarium-bridge-shib-bone-leash-token-price-plummet\">$2.5 million in funds were stuck on the bridge</a> at the time.</p><p>In the days following, the Shibarium team <a href=\"https://blog.shib.io/shibarium-scaling-post-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">claimed</a> to have scaled the server infrastructure by 1500% to better manage congestion on-chain.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

However, there is no similar corresponding scale to measure crypto literacy.\"</blockquote><p>The researchers point out that financial literacy “also plays a crucial role in preventing scams by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make informed financial decisions.” </p><p>In order to develop the CLS, the team viewed cryptocurrency literacy separate from overall financial literacy. “Cryptocurrencies may look like more traditional financial products on the surface” write the researchers, but due to the centralized nature of traditional finance, the decision-making processes learned through a normal financial literacy syllabus often don’t apply in the cryptocurrency world.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-crypto-tax-rules-in-the-us-law-decoded-aug-20-27\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/new-crypto-tax-rules-in-the-us-law-decoded-aug-20-27/amp\"><strong><em>New tax rules for crypto in the US: Law Decoded</em></strong></a></p><p>The researchers studied various aspects of cryptocurrency and distilled the basic knowledge requirements they felt necessary to demonstrate a basic understanding to 10 questions.

Following a comprehensive testing phase, Socrates is poised to redefine online interactions by providing a dynamic space for open debate and knowledge sharing.</p>\n<p>The platform enables users globally to earn rewards by easily creating and answering multiple-choice questions in-app, discussing any topic, from politics and science, to sports and entertainment. Individuals can also give reasons and like comments to further support their opinions.</p>\n<p>Utilising an intuitive user interface and blockchain technology, it will offer an uncomplicated overview of diverse perspectives, reducing spam and promoting the circulation of valuable and high-quality content. Uniquely, they've created an incentivised model where any interaction contributes to the question's prize pool. Once a question closes, potential rewards are distributed, stimulating meaningful conversations among participants.</p>\n<p>With web2 social media currently directing collective human thoughts and popular AI language technology providing standardised answers, Socrates emerges as a beacon of change. Combining the best of Social-Fi and Game-Fi, Socrates' mission is to explore how web3 technology can foster a new era of exploration and engagement. By creating a revolutionary platform encouraging free speech, it aims to combat misinformation and offer diverse human thoughts on issues in a secure environment.</p>\n\"We're hugely excited to enter the last phase of testing before we publicly launch. By leveraging the potential of web3 technology, we're enabling societies to understand new ways of thinking that transcend geographical and cultural boundaries,\" said Lottie Wells, Head of PR at Socrates. \"12th September 2023 will mark a new chapter in empowerment and engagement.\"\n<p>From 12th September 2023, the organisation invites users to join the debate by signing up and experiencing Socrates at socrates.xyz.</p>\n<p>About Socrates</p>\n<p>Socrates is a global web3 social media and educational platform based on the Polygon blockchain, where users earn by participating in multiple-choice Q&amp;As, debating and sharing knowledge. Combining the best of Social-Fi and Game-Fi, the organisation aims to explore the power of technology to reshape the world and new ways of collective thinking. It is named \"Socrates\" because it revolves around the core concept of \"multiple-choice questions without standard answers\" and embodies the spirit of thinking and dialectics.</p>\n<p>The function of the Socrates product lies in inspiring individuals to engage in dialectical thinking on a range of issues. The product aims to counteract the biased and extreme tendencies prevalent in mainstream social media's approach to societal problems, and seeks to propel human society towards a more rational, inclusive, equal and open direction. Furthermore, it harnesses collective wisdom to expand the boundaries of human thinking.</p>\n<p>Socrates aspires to showcase individuals' diverse perspectives, choices and debates on different issues to the world. In doing so, we aim to promote mutual understanding and inclusivity among individuals, nations, and countries. Our goal is to foster healthy competition and lasting peace in human society, thereby contributing to the exploration of new kinds of civilisation for humanity.</p>\n<p>Integral to Socrates' mission, they've developed a robust strategy ensuring the development of high-quality content in a concise way, that minimises spam and provokes engagement like never before.

    "description": "\n                        <p class=\"s2\">It is not every day that interesting events or conferences are held in the crypto market, and therefore it is especially important to talk about them. To ensure that all interested parties receive the necessary information in a timely manner. That is why I would like to announce a groundbreakingevent this fall - the Bitcoin Amsterdam conference on October 12-14 in the capital of the Netherlands.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">Recognizing the importance and significance of the event, the media partner of the event will be the well-known&nbsp;Bitcoin Magazine, whose Ukrainian franchise I am developing. Our readers will receive prompt information about the conference, its participants, and the topics discussed. I have no doubt that it will be interesting and professional, as always with Bitcoin Magazine.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">We will see a lot of interesting speakers who, I am sure, will be able to attract both professionals and those who are just discovering the crypto market. The event is expected to feature speeches by Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Beck, Paxful CEO Ray Youssef, Bitrefill CEO Sergey Kotlyar, White Rock Management CEO Andy Long, and even Prince Filip Karageorgovich of Serbia. Of course, this is not a complete list, and there will be many authoritative and interesting personalities.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">I think that especially those present will be interested in the founder of the Bitcoin fraction and member of the Libertarian Party of the Netherlands Tom van Lamoyen, who has already confirmed his participation on his page in X (former Twitter). In the parliament of his country, he deals with issues of economy, finance, taxation and supports the development of the crypto market, and he is considered a serious crypto activist.&nbsp;</p>\n&ldquo;Bitcoin is digital libertarianism,&rdquo; Lamoyen stresses.\n<p class=\"s2\">The Libertaire Partij (LP) is not a newcomer to politics (it has been in existence for 30 years) and advocates clear values that it articulates: to create \"a free world, a world in which no one is forced to sacrifice his life or property for the benefit of others\". In 2014, the LP became the first political party in the Netherlands to adopt and support Bitcoin. I am sure that Tom van Lamoyen will share with the participants of Bitcoin Amsterdam interesting experience and ideas for the future.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">There is a growing interest in cryptocurrencies in Europe, especially in the Netherlands. In 2023, CoinGecko analysts conducted an interesting survey and published a rating of the European states that are most interested in digital assets. The Netherlands, which accounted for 7.3% of such interest, ranked second after the United Kingdom. Analysts reported that most often the Dutch choose such coins - Fuse, Bone ShibaSwap and Cellframe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">In this country, full legalization of crypto has not yet passed, but the Central Bank of the Netherlands (DNB) has already issued work permits to 36 crypto companies. Last month, for example, it was received by Crypto.com, and before that &ndash; Coinbase Europe, eToro, Bitstamp.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">In the Netherlands, crypto activists are very strong, and we see the results of their work. There are very interesting projects. For example, last year it became known about a giant greenhouse near Rotterdam, which is heated by the heat emitted in the process of mining Bitcoin - it does not go to waste, as in other farms. Mining servers are powered by solar panels on the roof. The result is a carbon-neutral operation that performs an important environmental function and allows you to reduce costs. The initiative is called Bitcoin Bloem, and I&rsquo;m sure it will inspire many to other interesting projects.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">I think Tom van Lamoyen will be able to share his experiences and talk about other initiatives in his country and abroad. It is not only pleasant, but also very useful when politicians are interested in the crypto market and try to help its development. There are more and more examples of this around the world.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">In particular, Daniel Rish, Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Liechtenstein, has repeatedly stated the need for full legalization of Bitcoin in his country, and promised that cryptocurrency will be used to pay for public services. He also allowed investing in Bitcoin part of the foreign currency reserve of the state, which now amounts to 2.2 billion Swiss francs (2.5-year state budget of Liechtenstein).</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">In Poland, for example, Yaroslav Gowin from the center-right Accord party, formerly known as Poland Together, is a fan of cryptocurrencies. It was part of the ruling coalition United Right from 2015 to 2021. For most of this period, Gowin was Deputy Prime Minister as well as a member of parliament, and emphasized the potential of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">We should not forget about the American Cynthia Loummis&ndash; a US Senator from Wyoming, with whom I had the honour to discuss the prospects for the industry development and who has long supported the idea of cryptocurrencies. She bought her first Bitcoin back in 2013. Many times, shesupported laws expanding the use of cryptocurrency in the United States and two years ago, shelaunched the Senate Financial Innovation Group. Now, she is member of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">A few days ago, from the report of the Office of Government Ethics it became known that her epic Republican colleague and ex-president of the United States Donald Trump keeps up to $500 thousand in Ethereum wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">Earlier, the media reported that Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (nephew of the 35th American president) bought 14 bitcoins for his children &mdash; 2 each. He is a very progressive politician, whom many openly call a crypto activist after his impressive speech at the crypto conference in Miami in May 2023 at The Miami Beach Convention Center. Kennedy publicly called Bitcoin a hard currency and put it on a par with silver, gold, and platinum, noting that it is able to support the US dollar, and open a new stage of financial stability of the world and prosperity of the country.</p>\n<p class=\"s2\">The support of politicians is very important, as it contributes to the development of the crypto market and its widespread legalization. I think Robert F. Kennedy will be right, and eventually this support will help save the classical financial market as well.</p>\nSerhiy Tron is an investor and the founder of White Rock Management.\n<p class=\"s8\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
