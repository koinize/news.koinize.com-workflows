The tweet has also been deleted.</p><p>However, when interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked about advertisers leaving the platform, Musk stated: </p><blockquote>“If someone is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself .... Go … fuck … yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.”</blockquote><p>Musk also shouted out to Disney CEO Bob Iger, who was reportedly in the audience, saying “Hi Bob!” since the company was one of several advertisers that have left X. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“GO FUCK YOURSELF” <br><br>- Elon Musk <a href=\"https://t.co/UnucuBSBKj\">pic.twitter.com/UnucuBSBKj</a></p>&mdash; Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Teslaconomics/status/1730017570814926928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>“What this advertising boycott is going to do, it’s going to kill the company,” Musk told Sorkin, adding: “And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company, and we will document it in great detail.”</p><p>A Nov. 24 report from The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> that up to $75 million in revenue could be in jeopardy from over 200 advertisers, including Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Microsoft.</p><p>Earlier this month, Media Matters <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that it found ads for Apple, Bravo, Oracle, Xfinity, and IBM next to posts that tout Hitler and his Nazi Party on X.</p><p>According to a Nov. 25 NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a>, the platform has lost 50 of its top 100 advertisers since Elon Musk took over.

    "description": "Ethereum price corrected lower below $2,050. ETH is now consolidating above the $2,020 support and might start a fresh increase in the near term. Ethereum is still struggling to climb above the $2,075 and $2,080 resistance levels. The price is trading below $2,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average and then $2,075. Ethereum Price Trims Gains Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,075 resistance zone. The bears took control and pushed ETH below the $2,050 level. However, Bitcoin managed to stay above the $37,550 support zone. ETH traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,986 swing low to the $2,076 high.

The first key resistance is near the $2,075 level. The next resistance sits at $2,090. A clear move above the $2,090 level could send the price toward the $2,130 resistance zone. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next resistance is near $2,200, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,250 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,320 level.
