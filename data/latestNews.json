    "description": "Crypto analyst Adam Back believes there is a chance Bitcoin (BTC) could hit the $100,000 price mark ahead of the halving event in April. This prediction comes as Bitcoin continues its recovery from a rather bearish January. Data from the price tracking site, CoinMarketCap, reveals that BTC’s price gained by 11.02% in the last week, moving into the $47,000 zone.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin At $100,000 Not Far Off, Here’s When Dual Bull Cycle? Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Bull Run Pre-Halving In a post on X on February 10, Adam Back shared a Bitcoin price forecast in which he predicted the digital asset to attain a new all-time high (ATH) price before the much-anticipated halving event on April 12, 2023. Back based his projections on Bitcoin’s historical price data stating that just like on Friday, BTC crossed the $47,000 mark on October 1, 2021, in what would be a 41-day journey to its current ATH of $69,045.  1st oct 2021 #bitcoin crossed $47k like yesterday, then on it&#8217;s way to the $69k ATH. that run-up took 41 days. there are 70 days to the halving. just another data point for what it looks like, and how we may yet get a new ATH or even $100k before the halvening. pic.twitter.com/jmtQIHcenR — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 10, 2024 The analyst explained that he anticipates that BTC will maintain its present upward trajectory, embarking on a bull run to possibly notch a new ATH within the next 70 days leading up to the Bitcoin halving event. Back’s price prediction comes across as somewhat unique as, historically, the Bitcoin bull run usually occurs months after the halving event.  However, the crypto analyst explains in subsequent responses to certain X users that he anticipates the recent launch of the Bitcoin spot ETFs to induce a bull run before the halving event. Following a rather rocky launch, the Bitcoin spot ETF market appears to have finally found its expected rhythm, with consistent positive net inflows recorded throughout last week.  Notably, on Friday, the budding ETF market experienced a total net inflow of $541.5 million, second only to the $655.3 million recorded on the first trading session on January 11. In addition, Grayscale’s GBTC continues to see a consistent decline in outflows recording a new low of $51.8 million.  Adam Back predicts that a consistent development of the Bitcoin spot ETF market over the next few weeks could trigger a bull run pre-halving, causing the asset to potentially reach the $100,000 price mark. In addition, the analyst supports Bitcoin still to repeat its bull run months after the halving event, painting a dual bull cycle.  Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Overcome Past Trends?

Meanwhile, BTC continues to dominate the crypto market with the largest asset market cap of $936.17 billion.
