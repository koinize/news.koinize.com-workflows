There should be no white spots in the flight radar: the global rules should also apply to niche financial centers.”</blockquote><p>The same sentiment was recently expressed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who pushed for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-modi-global-cryptocurrency-framework-g20-summit\">global collaboration on formulating crypto regulations</a> among G20 member states. </p><p>Meanwhile in Germany, as in a number of other European markets, the crypto and blockchain sector became a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-leads-2023-fintech-investments-france-germany\">leader among the fintech companies</a> in investments, attracted during the first half of 2023. </p><p><strong><em><u>Magazine: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/dao-hyped-voting-decentralization/\"><strong><em>Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?
