    "description": "<p>PayPal has announced the launch of its native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD) based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\nFirst Global Payments Company to Launch a Stablecoin&nbsp;\n<p>On Monday, August 7, digital payments giant PayPal announced the official launch of its Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\" commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. \"Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to the company&rsquo;s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Starting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.&rdquo; reads the PayPal press release.&nbsp;</p>\n\nPayPal Continues Integration of Crypto\n<p>PayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.</p>\n<p>The prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it&rsquo;s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "The crypto space is never lacking of events &#8211; from hacks to memecoins frenzy, to traders realizing huge profits from trades. This time, it is the action of a particular Ethereum whale that has caught attention, one that has the ETH community in shock as to the reasons for such action.  The mysterious whale in question with the Ethereum address ‘nd4.eth’ sent $4.5 million worth of Ether (2,500 ETH) to a ‘burn’ address, in a move that removes these tokens from circulation forever. This interesting event, which occurred on July 26, has led to a burning question on the lips of everyone &#8211; who is this mysterious whale? Who Is The Mysterious Ethereum Whale? Although there is currently limited information on the mysterious whale, Crypto Twitter has been able to dig up some information as to who this person might be. Recent Twitter discussions revealed that the user behind ‘nd4.eth’ was on Binance Leaderboard which shows the traders in profits on the platform.  Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter Another Twitter user (@serialsexhaver) revealed that the trader had over $20 million in earnings on GMT long and “went all in on a btc short” and then deleted his account. The Tweet read: Last year he was on Binance leaderboard, made north on 20mill on gmt long, was giving away anons gmt sneakers and went all in on a btc short &#8230;then deleted his account This is also not the first time this particular user is doing something like this. According to information gotten from Web3 portfolio tracker DeBank, the “nd4.eth’ address had previously sent Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) to another burn address many times, with these transactions amounting to approximately $8,000 in total. The address still has a huge portfolio though, with close to $3.57 million staked on GMX and GNS. ETH price plunges to $1,823 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Contributing To The Growth Of ETH While the crypto community continues to speculate the reasons for the ‘$4.5 million burn,’ there is no doubt that the ‘nd4.eth’ address has, for whatever reason, contributed to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystems.  His actions also further fuel the Ethereum as an ‘ultra-sound money’ narrative. Laurence Day, the creator of the Wildcat Protocol, jokingly commended the individual when he stated: “If you didn’t wake up this morning and say thank you to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I want you to have a long, hard think about what you’re trying to achieve here.” Related Reading: Crypto Funds Vs Bitcoin Holders: Who Was The Better Performer In H1 2023 True to it, the burning of tokens makes it deflationary and is usually done to decrease the token’s circulating supply and help boost demand and increase its market value. Ethereum isn’t the only ecosystem that the said individual is contributing to.  According to a tweet from Lookonchain, the user “spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 GMX ($1,989) and 600 GNX ($2,733) to the dead address.” Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
