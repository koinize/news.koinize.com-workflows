In the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, crypto holders navigate complex regulatory landscapes, making it crucial to understand how crypto losses are taxed and their potential impact on tax liability. Whether new to crypto trading or with years of experience, reporting income and paying applicable taxes in compliance with local regulations is essential.</p><p>To comply with local cryptocurrency taxation laws, crypto holders must stay informed and compliant to avoid legal issues. This article examines the rules, deductions and implications an investor needs to know to stay compliant and minimize tax obligations in this ever-changing crypto tax landscape.</p><h2>Taxation of crypto losses in the United States</h2><h3>U.S. approach to crypto taxation</h3><p>In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires all sales of crypto to be reported, as it classifies cryptocurrencies as property and subject to capital gains tax. Gains and losses from crypto transactions are categorized by their duration, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/cryptocurrency-losses-and-gains-are-they-tax-deductible-or-taxable\">allowing losses to offset gains</a> and reduce overall tax liabilities.</p><p>Unless generating staking-related interest or other exceptional cases, cryptocurrencies kept in a portfolio are typically not subject to IRS taxation. Furthermore, a loss cannot be declared if an individual has invested in a cryptocurrency that has completely lost its value and is no longer traded on exchanges.</p><p>Maintaining precise transaction records is essential for accurate capital gain or loss calculations. Moreover, reporting both losses and gains is mandatory, and the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/more-irs-crypto-reporting-more-danger\">IRS is actively enforcing compliance</a> with penalties for inaccuracies. </p><h3>How are crypto losses taxed and offset in the U.S.?</h3><p>In the U.S., crypto losses are typically categorized as capital losses, arising when the value of cryptocurrency holdings decreases from acquisition to the point of sale, exchange or use. Reporting crypto losses can reduce taxes in two ways: through income tax deductions and by offsetting capital gains.</p><p>When losses surpass gains, the resulting net losses can be utilized for income tax deductions, allowing for a reduction of up to $3,000 from income, and any remaining excess losses can be carried forward to offset future capital gains and $3,000 of other income in subsequent years.</p><p>Cryptocurrency losses offer substantial tax savings, offsetting capital gains without restrictions on the amount, potentially avoiding a substantial tax liability. The IRS categorizes losses as short-term or long-term, following the traditional investment framework. Short-term losses from assets held for under a year are taxed at ordinary rates (10%–37%), while long-term losses from assets held over a year face lower capital gains tax rates (0%–20%).</p><h3>Wash-sale rule and treatment of crypto losses in the U.S.</h3><p>In the U.S., investors can engage in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-crypto-tax-loss-harvesting-and-how-does-it-work\">tax-loss harvesting</a> with cryptocurrency, selling at a loss to reduce taxes due to the IRS’ property classification. Since the IRS treats cryptocurrencies as property rather than capital assets, it technically exempts crypto from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-the-wash-sale-rule-and-does-it-apply-to-crypto\">wash-sale rules</a> and allows more flexibility. </p><p>Crypto holders can utilize losses to offset gains without being bound by the wash-sale rule, enabling them to sell at a loss, realize tax benefits, and reinvest to maintain their position. Nevertheless, regulatory changes might extend the rule to crypto in the future, making safer strategies advisable to minimize capital gains.</p><h2>Taxation of crypto losses in the United Kingdom</h2><h3>The U.K.’s approach to crypto taxation</h3><p>In the U.K., claiming cryptocurrency losses on a tax return is an essential step in reducing overall tax liability. To initiate the process, it’s critical to keep thorough records of every crypto transaction.</p><p>His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) considers cryptocurrencies as taxable assets, meaning that trading or selling crypto can incur a tax liability. Since cryptocurrency is currently treated by HMRC similarly to the majority of other financial assets, it is subject to record-keeping requirements and Capital Gains Tax (CGT). The type of transaction determines the exact tax treatment.</p><p>In the U.K., the capital gains tax is a consideration for individuals trading in cryptocurrencies. The CGT rates are directly connected to the taxation of crypto losses and the utilization of tax-free thresholds. The current CGT rates range from 10% to 20%, depending on the individual’s income and gains.</p><h3>How are crypto losses taxed and offset in the U.K.?</h3><p>When reporting crypto losses, the CGT section of the Self Assessment tax return must be completed. This section enables the offset of capital losses against any capital gains incurred during the same tax year. </p><p>In the U.K., investors are not permitted to directly offset capital losses from cryptocurrency against their income tax liability. However, when losses arise from cryptocurrency transactions, they can be deducted from the overall capital gains in the tax year. </p><p>If total losses surpass gains, the remaining losses can be carried forward to offset future gains. This mechanism serves as a valuable tool for managing tax liability, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency market, which has the potential for significant losses as well as gains. </p><p>Importantly, there is no immediate requirement to report crypto losses. However, if you claim them, there is a four-year window from the end of the tax year in which the losses occurred. This flexibility allows taxpayers sufficient time for financial assessment and loss claims aligned with individual tax planning. </p><p>Overall, by accurately recording and reporting crypto losses, individuals can fully leverage the tax relief provided by the U.K. government while effectively managing cryptocurrency tax obligations. The ability to carry them forward will be lost if this step is neglected.</p><h3>Optimizing crypto tax reporting in the UK through token pooling</h3><p>It’s worth noting that HMRC requires taxpayers to pool their tokens for calculating cost bases in cryptocurrency transaction gain/loss reporting. Tokens must be categorized into pools, each with an associated pooled cost. Upon selling tokens from a pool, a portion of the pooled cost (along with allowable expenses) can be deducted to reduce the gain.</p><p>The pooled cost should be recalculated with each token purchase or sale. When tokens are acquired, the purchase amount is added to the relevant pool, and when they’re sold, a proportionate sum is deducted from the pooled cost. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/848734c2-c987-4ca7-ba60-67e1dd2b060d.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Taxation of crypto losses in Canada </h2><h3>Canadian approach to crypto taxation</h3><p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers cryptocurrency a property and subject to taxation as a commodity, falling under the categories of business income or capital gains. Disposing of crypto, such as selling it, trading it for another crypto or using it for purchases, triggers capital gains tax. </p><p>In Canada, taxes are not imposed on purchasing or holding cryptocurrency, as it’s not regarded as legal tender. Therefore, using it for payments is seen as a barter transaction with corresponding tax consequences, resulting in potential capital gains or losses based on the cryptocurrency’s value change when exchanged for goods or services.</p><p>While crypto provides some anonymity, the Canadian government has the capability to trace crypto transactions as exchanges are mandated to report transactions over $10,000. Even sub-threshold transactions may require customer data disclosure upon the CRA’s request. </p><h3>How are crypto losses taxed and offset in Canada?</h3><p>In Canada, investors need to report capital losses to the CRA to potentially reduce their tax liability, as the agency mandates filing an income tax and benefit return for any capital property sale, irrespective of a gain or loss outcome.</p><p>Canadian crypto taxpayers can offset various capital gains with cryptocurrency losses, carrying the net loss forward or using it to offset gains from the previous three years. However, cryptocurrency losses cannot be used to offset regular income within the year, and 50% of cryptocurrency losses can be applied to offset capital gains in subsequent years or carry them back to previous years, mirroring the tax treatment of cryptocurrency capital gains.</p><p>Usually, when an allowable capital loss occurs within a tax year, it should be initially offset against any taxable capital gains within the same year. If there’s still an unutilized loss, it contributes to the net capital loss calculation for that year, which can then be applied to reduce taxable capital gains in any of the preceding three years or any future year.</p><p>It’s important to highlight that to access tax benefits, investors must “realize” their loss by selling cryptocurrency, exchanging it for another, or using it for purchase; unrealized losses cannot be claimed on a tax return.</p><h3>Superficial loss rule and treatment of crypto losses in Canada</h3><p>Canada’s superficial loss rule, similar to the U.S. wash sale rule, prevents investors from exploiting artificial losses by selling and immediately repurchasing the same property within specific timeframes, ensuring a fair tax system. </p><p>According to the CRA, this rule comes into play to prevent wash sales if two conditions are met:</p><ul><li>The taxpayer or their representative obtains an identical cryptocurrency within 30 days before or after selling it.</li><li>By the end of this period, the taxpayer or an affiliated person holds or has the right to acquire the same cryptocurrency.</li></ul><p>These losses cannot offset capital gains but are instead added to the adjusted cost base of the repurchased property.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

The answer is complex. </p>\n                    <p><p>Cryptocurrency enthusiasts often argue that businesses need to start accepting crypto as payments for adoption to grow — boosting usability and potentially creating strong demand for these currencies.</p><p>Some crypto communities often focus heavily on growing business adoption, with maps now<a href=\"https://coinmap.org/view/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> compiling</a> businesses worldwide that accept different cryptocurrencies as a payment method.</p><p>But if a business accepts cryptocurrency payments only to dump them on the market, it may undermine the entire effort, as the assets are just being sold back on the market right after payment.</p><p>Moreover, a business accepting cryptocurrency payments through a third-party processor isn’t adhering to the cryptocurrency ethos of managing their own private keys, meaning controlling their wallet fully.</p><p>On the flip side, proponents argue that the mere act of enabling cryptocurrency payments opens up new avenues for consumers to transact in crypto, bringing in a new, long-awaited use case. </p><h2>Do businesses accepting crypto boost adoption?</h2><p>On its surface, a business accepting cryptocurrency payments would boost adoption. Still, if the digital currency received is immediately sold back on the market, it’s generating as much demand as it is supply. This simultaneous buy-sell cycle may not significantly contribute to cryptocurrency adoption.</p><p>Additionally, it isn’t clear how relevant a business accepting cryptocurrency payments can be for actual adoption, as users are unlikely to go through the process of buying cryptocurrencies if they can just pay in their local fiat currency.</p><p>The essence of adoption doesn’t merely reside in the act of acceptance by businesses; it fundamentally lies in the ease of access and willingness of consumers to transition to cryptocurrencies for their transactional needs.</p><p>A study by leading research and advisory firm Forrester Consulting<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929005406/en/Study-Shows-Merchants-Accept-Bitcoin-Attract-New\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> revealed</a> that merchants accepting Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) attracted new customers and sales.</p><p>The study found that cryptocurrency payments bring in up to 40% of new customers for merchants, with crypto customers spending twice as much as those using credit cards. </p><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, BitPay chief marketing officer William Zielke referenced the Forrester Consulting study and said cryptocurrency payment processors give cryptocurrency spenders a fast, easy way to pay for large ticket items and everyday purchases.</p><p>Zielke said that during the first half of this year, BitPay saw a 10% uptick in new customer sign-ups compared to the previous year despite the volatile cryptocurrency market. He added that while some brands may already have a technically savvy user base when they start accepting crypto, other merchants may end up introducing new users to crypto:</p><blockquote>“Alternatively, merchants like AMC Theatres connect with a broad base of customers who may need to be better-versed in the crypto world. Partnering with big brands like AMC Theatres is an excellent way to boost consumer adoption since it introduces crypto payments for everyday purchases.”</blockquote><p>Sankar Krishnan, head of digital assets and fintech at consulting firm Capgemini, told Cointelegraph that money serves “both transactional and savings purposes” and that he would argue that “cryptocurrency captures greater interest from consumers today as they anticipate its value will rise in the future.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Krishnan said it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their extreme volatility, which means that the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions is “still a work in progress.”</p><p>Per Krishnan, when cryptocurrencies “become a more viable option for day-to-day purchases, we can expect more payment providers to embrace and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.” He added, however, that whether a business keeps the cryptocurrencies it accepts for goods and services or sells them right away “is linked to the company’s treasury strategy.”</p><p>According to the Capgemini executive, the price volatility of cryptocurrencies heavily influences this choice, as the market can move in either direction between the firm accepting payment and selling the digital assets, which would only be beneficial if it were actively engaging in crypto trading.</p><p>A business accepting cryptocurrency payments and selling the crypto right away, Krishnan said, also “sends a clear message to the market that they do not anticipate the cryptocurrency’s value to appreciate in the future.” Per his words, it’s a “de-risking move” the business makes.</p><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, Justas Paulius, CEO of cryptocurrency payments processor CoinGate, took a balanced approach and said that it can’t be proven whether this buy-sell cycle has “a small, large or no impact at all as there are many factors that need to be considered first, for example, which cryptocurrency is being used, how and where it is being sold, and how much.”</p><p>Paulius added that consumers “tend to re-purchase cryptocurrency they’ve spent soon after,” suggesting that when businesses accept cryptocurrency, there’s indeed higher demand. He said, however, that the advantage may be in the generated liquidity:</p><blockquote>“Whether the currency is being bought or sold, these actions from both sides create better liquidity in the market and, in a way, balances each other out, also helps determine the true price of a currency at any given moment.”</blockquote><p>Businesses accepting cryptocurrency payments may nevertheless boost adoption in other ways, including by simply spreading awareness of their support for cryptocurrencies or specific payment processors that may offer other services.</p><h2>Crypto payment processors as on-ramps</h2><p>Cryptocurrency payment processors may allow businesses that do not accept cryptocurrency payments directly to allow consumers to pay with them. Major automobile manufacturer Honda, for example, does not accept crypto payments, but through FCF Pay, people can use Bitcoin and other <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/honda-denies-accepting-crypto-payment\">cryptocurrencies to buy a Honda car</a>.</p><p>Paulius noted that awareness spreads as “people see these payment options being introduced by small and large businesses every day,” which signals a growing demand for digital assets. These signals, he said, could see businesses’ competitors become “intrigued and curious.”</p><p>He added there’s “little-to-no downside to enabling a crypto payment method,” but instead “brings several tangible benefits” to businesses that do. According to the Forrester Consulting study, accepting crypto does seem to bring in more customers who spend more.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/4f279d0d-7f74-472c-a907-3dbdd5de48de.png\"  /></figure><p>Third-party payment processors, BitPay said, help businesses stay compliant with all local regulations to facilitate accepting cryptocurrency payments while promoting new businesses to the cryptocurrency community as they start accepting crypto payments:</p><blockquote>“Leveraging third-party payment processors allows businesses to accept crypto payments without the need to touch or hold crypto, removing the volatility risks. The quick integration times and easy setup make it a simple, fast alternative to using your own wallet. Companies utilizing a processor also escape having to track their costs based on different coins for tax purposes.”</blockquote><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, Gracy Chen, managing director at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, said that the “e adoption of new things requires extensive user education to establish awareness and trust,” and businesses using third-party payment processors “can play a pivotal role in popularizing cryptocurrencies.”</p><p>While third-party payment processors can seemingly be on-ramps for the cryptocurrency space, it’s worth noting that their use dilutes the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies centered on decentralization and self-sovereignty. Using them also means businesses rely on an external platform to receive crypto payments, which could be hard to change in the future if necessary.</p><p>Paulius said that, in some cases, it may be more beneficial for businesses to manage their wallets. These firms, he said, could just use open-source solutions and run their own processors.</p><p>The move, however, would come with added risks “such as AML [Anti-Money Laundering] screening or KYC [Know Your Customer] management as you still need to follow the law and adhere to rules. He added:</p><blockquote>“Businesses tend to want to accept many cryptocurrencies at once, but only get periodic payouts in a single currency like U.S. dollars or euros to a bank account, which would be challenging to set up by yourself.”</blockquote><p>Paulius noted that businesses also want easy integrations, transaction notifications, and the ability to refund customers and accept payments on various networks, all of which are facilitated by payment processors.</p><p>While there are costs associated with integrating cryptocurrency payments with third-party payment processors, Paulius concluded, they are “still less expensive than processing card payments.”</p><p>While accepting cryptocurrency payments may be challenging for most businesses, what to do with the received amounts may prove just as difficult. Most companies accepting crypto payments convert the funds immediately, but what if they didn’t?</p><h2>Why pay with crypto?</h2><p>Even if businesses accept cryptocurrency payments — via their own solutions or third-party payment processors — one question remains: why would consumers choose to pay with cryptocurrencies over their local fiat currency, especially if they don’t previously own crypto?</p><p>Paulius said that in some cases, banking is not an option, and cryptocurrencies could be a much-needed solution. Refugees or people stuck in dire situations in countries foreign to them or where the financial system isn’t functioning could rely on a decentralized network for their payments.</p><p>While Paulius conceded that “it is not common for consumers to buy cryptocurrencies just to use them for retail payments,” it noted it’s “likely in several cases,” as some people value their privacy greatly.</p><blockquote>“Many of those people use cryptocurrencies for buying VPNs, hosting solutions, proxies and similar services just because they can remain pseudonymous and disclose less or none of their personal information to fewer third parties.” </blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies, Paulius concluded, can also be a faster way to make transactions. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of YouHodler, said that in the city of Lugano, Switzerland, BTC and Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>) can easily be used in various shops and restaurants via the same point-of-sale terminals used for traditional card payments.</p><p>Per Volkov, some startups are working on ways to use these terminals to let users pay directly from their MetaMask wallets. </p><p>Companies can provide a way for consumers to use cryptocurrencies, making these digital assets more familiar and useful. Additionally, third-party processors make it easier and less intimidating for businesses to start accepting cryptocurrencies, which might encourage other companies to do the same, seeing the growing interest.</p><p>The path to mainstream adoption is more complex, however, as what is done with the cryptocurrency and whether consumers even choose to pay in crypto play a pivotal role.</p><p>While more sophisticated and tech-savvy consumers will likely use cryptocurrency payments to protect their privacy, cryptocurrencies could also provide a lifeline in more extreme scenarios. Whether they’ll be accepted as a payment method when showtime comes remains to be seen.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-key-resistance-november-surge/",
    "description": "As November unfolds, the Shiba Inu price action hangs in the balance, with technical analysis revealing a battleground of resistance and support levels that could determine the direction of the meme coin in the coming weeks. However, the bullish indicators are currently strong and could point to a continuation of the rally in the short term. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Weekly Chart The SHIB/USD weekly chart illustrates a dynamic struggle between bullish and bearish forces. A quadruple bottom pattern, evident at support levels labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, demonstrates a consistent rebound within a two-week timeframe. This pattern signifies a resolute defense by the bulls, offering a signal that indicates a solid base in the range of $0.000006 to $0.000007. In contrast, the descending triangle pattern poses a bearish threat. The flat support line at $0.00000715 and the sloping blue trend line connecting lower highs depict a narrowing field for the bulls, suggesting a potential decrease in buying momentum. The volume profile supports this, with notable declines accompanying the touches of the descending trend line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Surge In Whale Activity, Will This Affect SHIB? After rising above the 20-week EMA (red line), SHIB is facing the 0.236 Fib level at $0.00000878. Overcoming this resistance is pivotal for SHIB to assert bullish dominance and attempt to break the descending trend line just above $0.00000900. A successful breach could see the price aim for the 50-week EMA at $0.0000985 and subsequently the 0.382 Fib level at $0.00001051, a move that would signify a substantial reversal from the prevailing downtrend in the long-term price chart. Notably, the EMAs on the weekly chart indicate a still bearish sentiment with the longer-term moving averages positioned above the shorter-term ones, hinting at a sustained bearish trend. However, the recent price uptick could indicate an early sign of a shift in momentum if sustained. Daily Chart Insights The daily chart offers a more granular view of SHIB&#8217;s recent price action. The 20-day EMA has crossed above the 50 and 100-day EMAs, a bullish sign that could foresee further upside. The daily RSI is also on an uptrend, which aligns with the current bullish narrative, suggesting there is room for upward movement in November. However, a recent rejection at the 0.382 Fib level ($0.00000844) and a slip below the 200-day EMA ($0.00000836) at the beginning of the week introduced caution into the bullish case. The 200-day EMA, a critical long-term indicator of momentum, has historically acted as a decisive pivot point for SHIB. Related Reading: Self-Authentication System Of Shiba Inu Has Technical Issues, Developer Reveals The price fluctuation around this line and subsequent tests of the descending trend line underscore its significance. A breach above the 200-day EMA could signal the start of a rally, potentially propelling SHIB by an estimated 13% towards the overhead resistance posed by the descending trend line. Currently, SHIB is trading slightly below the 200-EMA. Remarkably, SHIB attacked the trend line of the ascending triangle (blue line) pattern in the weekly chart each time it surpassed the 200-day EMA. Notable is also that this always happened within one week. Thus, the 200-day EMA seems to be the most crucial resistance in the short term. If Shiba Inu breaks above the indicator, the price could rally approximately 13% to the blue trend line of the ascending triangle pattern. Afterward, the Shiba Inu price could then make its ninth attempt in the last 15 months to break out of the gigantic triangle pattern. This will be another make-or-break moment for SHIB, either massive bullish momentum is unleashed or the Shiba Inu price could fall again toward the neckline of the descending triangle at $0.00000715.
