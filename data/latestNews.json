Once this milestone is reached, bitcoin miners&#x2019; rewards for each block, excluding transaction fees, will decrease to 3.125 coins post-halving, a sharp drop from the current rate of 6.25 BTC per block.

    "description": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave has suspended operations in a number of markets after receiving a problem report on a certain function of the protocol. DeFi Protocol Discovers Vulnerability; Is User Funds At Risk? On Saturday, November 4, decentralized lending protocol Aave announced &#8211; via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it has paused the Aave V2 Ethereum market and suspended certain assets on Avalanche. In addition, the protocol has frozen specific assets on Aave V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.¬† According to the protocol‚Äôs announcement, these actions serve as a temporary precautionary measure following a problem report on a specific feature.¬† Related Reading: RUNE Solid 100% Rally Hits Barrier: THORChain Price Nears Key Resistance Furthermore, Aave said in the post that the Aave V3 markets on Ethereum, Base, and Metis and the V2 markets on Polygon and Avalanche are unaffected.

(@peckshield) November 4, 2023 While Aave did not specify what the issue is or the feature that caused the problem, the protocol said it would release a detailed explanation once there is a full resolution. The statement read: A governance proposal to restore the normal operation of the protocols will be submitted shortly. A detailed postmortem will be released once the issue is fully resolved. Aave further clarified that users supplying or borrowing from a frozen assets pool can still withdraw and repay positions. However, these users can‚Äôt supply or borrow more funds from the frozen assets pool until the issue is resolved. The protocol added:¬† On paused assets, no action can be done until unpaused. AAVE Price Remains Steady Despite Protocol Vulnerability There is no evidence to suggest that the problem has had any impact on the value of the protocol‚Äôs native token, AAVE. As of this writing, the token is valued at $90.15, reflecting a negligible 0.9% price dip in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the token is outperforming on a bigger timeframe. Over the past week, AAVE‚Äôs price has swelled by more than 10%, touching the $100 mark &#8211; for the first time since February &#8211; at some point during the week.
