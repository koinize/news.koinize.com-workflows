Lawyers have asked for the measures to extend to visitors “pre-approved” by the court. </p><p>The list — which was viewed by prosecutors with no objections — includes “close friends and colleagues of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents and household help that regularly visit the house,” according to the letter.</p><p>The list was filed under seal with the lawyers arguing the privacy and safety of those mentioned “greatly outweigh any presumption of access to the list.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/c3994714-73b1-4405-b71b-3fae2ec6c34f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The first page of the letter by Bankman-Fried’s lawyers sent to Judge Kaplan.
