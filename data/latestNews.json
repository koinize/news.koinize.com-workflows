During the show, Broyles laid out his Bitcoin investment thesis and his unique perspectives on how the asset’s price could eventually rise into seven-figure territory.</p><p>Broyles said that in 2020, he realized the bond market was broken. While searching for alternative investments, he discovered Bitcoin as a sound option. When asked about his <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-holds-200-day-trendline-btc-bottom\">Bitcoin investment strategy</a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-holds-200-day-trendline-btc-bottom\"></a> and how he stomachs the volatility, Broyles said: </p><blockquote>“I do not own bonds. I have sold off 97% of my stocks over the past three years, and I’m selling off the last 3% this week actually, so it’s funny that you ask that. By the end of this week, the only three assets that I will own will be U.S. dollars, aka cash, the best political currency in the world; second, real estate; and third, Bitcoin. That’s it. And I sleep better now than I did with a diversified portfolio.” </blockquote><h2>Everything is overpriced and should crash</h2><p>Another key factor backing Broyles’ Bitcoin investment thesis is his belief that “everything is overvalued, nothing makes sense, and everything should crash; however, we don’t want to deal with it. Politicians don’t want to deal with it. Lawyers don’t want to deal with it. I, as a real estate investor, don’t want to deal with it.” Broyles believes that stocks, healthcare, real estate and the education industry are highly overvalued, so people are losing faith in the dollar and their dollar purchasing power — which highlights the allure of Bitcoin as a supply-capped asset. </p><blockquote>“If we have a credit unwind, of course we’re going to print ourselves out of it.” </blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/future-btc-mining-and-the-bitcoin-halving\"><strong><em>The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving</em></strong></a></p><h2>When is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? </h2><p>When asked whether there is a particular price where it becomes “too late” for investors to consider buying Bitcoin, Broyles made the analogy of a sinking ship and suggested that for those on the boat, it’s never too late to exit. </p><blockquote>“At no point is it ever too late to buy Bitcoin, but it will be too late to exit bonds and to exit fiat.” </blockquote><p>Listen to the full episode of <em>Market Talks</em> on the new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@cointelegraphmarketresearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cointelegraph Markets &amp; Research YouTube channel</a>, and don’t forget to click “Like” and “Subscribe” to keep up-to-date with all our latest content.</p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "After a long stretch of only offering Polygon (MATIC) in its Web3 wallet, Robinhood shocks the crypto space with its announcement that it is adding two prominent cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Dogecoin, into its wallet offerings.  Dogecoin And Bitcoin Now Available On Robinhood Wallet California-based financial services company Robinhood has announced its new listing of Dogecoin and Bitcoin in its self-custodial Web3 wallet, Robinhood Wallet.  The press release comes as a thrilling surprise for cryptocurrency investors, as users can now have access to BTC and DOGE tokens through their Robinhood wallets. Related Reading: This Metric Indicates Shibarium Is Growing Rapidly Following Its Public Launch Responding to its users&#8217; pleas, Robinhood Wallet revealed that it was adding Bitcoin and Dogecoin blockchains, which means it now supports a total of six blockchain networks, including Polygon, Optimism, Ethereum, and Arbitrium.  The financial services firm has also launched a Web3 Browser which will allow its users to link their wallets directly to decentralized applications (dApps).  Christine Brown, Robinhood&#8217;s Head of Crypto spoke enthusiastically on the newly added tokens in the Robinhood Wallet. She stated that the two tokens were one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the space and the financial services firm looks forward to its users to benefit from trading and investing in the newly listed cryptocurrencies.  “We’re excited to add Bitcoin and Dogecoin to Robinhood Wallet. These are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, and we’re glad to give our users the ability to store, send, and receive them,” Brown stated.  Robinhood Crypto GM, Johann Kerbat also welcomed the new addition to the Robinhood wallet. He stated that the Robinhood wallet aims to facilitate adoption and reduce the challenges faced by the DeFi ecosystem.  He explained that Robinhood will continue to satisfy its user’s needs as it advances and improves its platform with more unique features.  “With Robinhood Wallet, we stripped away many of the complexities of DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem, and reduced some of the challenges and barriers to entry for everyday people,” Kerbat said.  He added, “We’ve been really encouraged by the adoption so far, and are excited to keep building for our customers around the world as we ship new features and expand support for new networks and tokens.” HOOD stock price sitting above $11 &#124; Source: Robinhood Markets, Inc. on Tradingview.com Robinhood Wallet Adoption Poised For Increase Following In-App Ethereum Swap Feature Earlier in 2022, Robinhood launched a beta version of its crypto wallet and the demand for the wallet was staggering, with over 2 million users on the waitlist. Currently, the Robinhood Wallet boasts hundreds of thousands of users based in more than 120 countries around the globe.  The Robinhood Wallet will be offering in-app swaps on Ethereum for selected users, allowing them to trade their ETH for over 200 different ERC-20 tokens available on the platform. The wallet is currently available for all users in the United States.

The financial services company also previously listed USDC, its first stablecoin, in its portfolio, potentially closing the gap with the stablecoin’s major competitor, USDT.
