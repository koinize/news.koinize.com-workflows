    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/",
    "description": "Despite concerns about the XRP price performance in this market cycle, this crypto expert has elaborated on why he believes the crypto token will still record significant gains. He even predicts that XRP could rise to as high as $10.  Why XRP Price Could Rise To As High As $10 Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that his price range for XRP in this market cycle is between $5 and $10. According to him, this is possible considering that there are predictions that ETH will rise to between $7,500 and $10,000 and Bitcoin will rise to between $100,000 and $150,000.  Related Reading: Crypto Report Says ‘Alameda Gap’ Is Gone After Bitcoin Rally, What This Means Nick noted that the XRP price rising to between $5 and $10 would put its market cap at $500 billion and 1 trillion, respectively. That puts the crypto token’s market cap in a similar category to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could be valued as high as $2.9 trillion and $1.2 trillion if their price predictions are fully actualized.  In other words, Nick argues that XRP hitting these prices is not farfetched since there is still much room for growth for the two largest crypto tokens by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. As those two tokens continue to increase in price, he expects XRP to follow suit. Interestingly, he opined that his XRP prediction is “conservative,” suggesting XRP could go way higher.  Following Nick’s assertion, another X user remarked that comparing XRP to Bitcoin and Ethereum seemed out of place since BTC and ETH’s price prediction is just a 2x, unlike XRP, which will need to see a 10x in its price to hit those targets. Nick responded that this simply shows that XRP is undervalued and presents a great ROI opportunity in this cycle.  The Belief In XRP’s Potential Nick joins a list of crypto analysts who have expressed optimism about XRP’s potential in this market cycle despite its underperformance to start this bull run. Crypto expert Zach Rector also recently shared his belief and gave reasons why XRP is still bound to perform well in this bull market.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Retrace Spooks Investors: What Is It And Why Does It Matter? Although he didn’t give any price prediction, he alluded to XRP’s fundamentals as one reason why he holds this belief. Meanwhile, technical analysts like Egrag Crypto have also made bullish price predictions for XRP heading into this market cycle. Egrag has even gone as far as suggesting that the XRP price could rise to as high as $27 at the peak of this bull run.  At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.58, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Token price retests $0.6 &#124; Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Coingape, chart from Tradingview.com"
