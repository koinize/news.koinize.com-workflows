There is going to be assets that flow into this industry [...] the closer and closer we get to the halving it will coincide with a supply shock and we could see a repeat of 2020 where we go up quite significantly in price.”</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a note from analysts at JPMorgan also predicts that the SEC will likely have no choice but to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs following Grayscale's <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">legal victory</a> on Aug. 29, according to recent reports. </p><h3>Musk biography reveals he’s been quietly funding Dogecoin: Report</h3><p>An excerpt of Elon Musk’s new biography reportedly reveals Musk’s early ambitions to build a blockchain-based “everything app” which included using Dogecoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">(DOGE)</a> for payments.</p><p>The excerpt, published on The Wall Street Journal on Aug. 31, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/elon-musk-twitter-x-takeover-walter-isaacson-5f553fa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reveals</a> that Musk, was “semi-serious” about integrating Dogecoin for in-app payments on X (formerly Twitter) and was supposedly “funding” the memecoin.</p><p>“Perhaps, he said half-jokingly, it could have a payment system using Dogecoin, the semi-serious cryptocurrency whose development he had been quietly funding,” the excerpt read. </p><p>The excerpt written in context of Musk’s ambitions to turn X into a payments platform where users could send money, hand out tips and pay for stories, music and videos.</p><p>Charging people a small amount to be verified was another one of Musk’s plans to provide a new revenue stream for the platform, which eventually came into effect. </p><blockquote>“It could fulfill my original vision for X.com and PayPal.”</blockquote><p>The multibillionaire has wanted to create an “everything app” — which offers banking services, social media and other applications all in one — since he created X.com over 20 years ago.</p><p>The excerpt revealed that Musk strongly considered building a blockchain-based app to enable the all-in-one service:</p><blockquote>“I think a new social-media company is needed that is based on the blockchain and includes payments.”</blockquote><p>However, Musk ultimately decided to buy Twitter because of its strong user base, the excerpt said.</p><h3>Tom Emmer rebuffs Gary Gensler’s claims that crypto “rife with noncompliance’</h3><p>United States Congressman Tom Emmer has taken another shot at SEC chair Gary Gensler, after the regulator recently suffered two defeats in court at the hands of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">Ripple Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">Grayscale</a>.</p><p>Emmer called out Gensler for his anti-crypto stance in a Sept. 3 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1698058461169525105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">post </a>on X (formerly Twitter).</p><p>“We will see how pending litigation plays out, but it should be increasingly obvious to policymakers that, despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryGensler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">@GaryG</a>ensler's mass marketing campaign, crypto is not an industry rife with noncompliance,” Emmer wrote.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.
