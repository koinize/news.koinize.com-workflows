Torres <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1681336088873279488\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">requested</a> the SEC limit its enforcement cases to “bonafide bad actors\" rather than “indiscriminately” treating the majority of crypto assets as securities under its purview. The lawmaker’s letter followed a court ruling in the SEC’s case against blockchain firm Ripple which suggested that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a> token was largely not a security.</p><p>“Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has not issued a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance,\" said Rep. Torres. \"All it has done is sent mixed messages, one after the another [sic], not only contradicting the CFTC but often contradicting itself.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crypto regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court.  <br><br>In light of the SDNY’s landmark decision in the Ripple case, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SECGov</a> must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry.  <br><br>My letter to Chair Gensler: <a href=\"https://t.co/Mrk63N4KhH\">pic.twitter.com/Mrk63N4KhH</a></p>&mdash; Rep.

Torres echoed other experts in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-appeal-ripple-xrp-case-unlikely-current-confusion\">suggesting a quick appeal</a> to the court decision was unlikely, and with a new legal foundation, the SEC’s case against Coinbase could also be at risk. The commission <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\">filed a lawsuit</a> against the exchange in June for allegedly offering unregistered securities. </p><blockquote>“[The SEC] must reassess its reckless regulatory assault on the crypto industry.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-court-ruling-regulation-more-compelling-more-urgent-former-cftc-chair\"><strong><em>Ripple court ruling makes call for regulation ‘more compelling and more urgent’ — former CFTC chair</em></strong></a></p><p>The U.S. lawmaker coincidentally shares a surname with the judge in the SEC v. Ripple case, Judge Analisa Torres. He referred to the XRP court ruling as the ‘Torres Doctrine’ — likely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679594777388498944\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">referring</a> to the judge and not himself, as he “never met a Torres who was wrong on crypto”. Rep. Torres is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.</p><p>It’s unclear how the SEC intends to respond to the court ruling. Chair Gensler <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-gary-gensler-reaction-to-ripple-decision-is-mixed-still-under-consideration\">said on July 17</a> that he was “disappointed” on the impact the judge’s decision could have on retail investors, and the commission was still considering what if any actions it might take.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-regulation-sec-chair-gary-gensler-final-say/\"><strong><em>Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
