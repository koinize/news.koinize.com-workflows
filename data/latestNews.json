Source: Street Cy₿er</em></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to specific pieces of their work,  Street said the premise behind “Buy Bitcoin Defund The State” was to get people thinking about how Bitcoin can help create a freer society by reducing the role of the state in people’s lives.</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is a peaceful way to protest against the state and its policies. It is a way to opt out of the traditional financial system [and] escape the tyranny of the state.”</blockquote><p>Street said Bitcoin is being used to build a “new society” that flourishes off of individual freedom and voluntary cooperation — a philosophy pushed by many cryptocurrency-anarchists around the world.</p><h3>“Make war unaffordable”</h3><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/93d5e037-129f-4bed-a531-2e8318672d4e.PNG\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Make War Unaffordable” poster. Source: Street Cy₿er</em></figcaption></figure><p>Street says Bitcoin’s scarcity will make it difficult for governments to wage wars because they cannot print more BTC to finance them.</p><p>“This will make it more difficult for governments to maintain large militaries and will make war less affordable,” he said.</p><p>If wars were hypothetically funded with Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s transparency would make it tough for state actors to hide war spending, believes Street, and such attacks would be more likely to be picked up by opposing states.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/6eda8e45-876a-4f45-99fa-04a44aa76fa8.PNG\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Graffiti artist at work.

This would make governments more accountable to their citizens and would help to ensure that education is a top priority.”</blockquote><p>Not all of Street Cy₿er’s Bitcoin street art is politically motivated — the crew is also appealing to cartoon lovers by showcasing Bitcoin’s symbol with the likes of Mario and Ronald McDonald.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/f0486433-081c-4d8d-ab97-d5d50ed6a124.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin graffiti by Street Cy₿er.

Years of experience have dulled the pain.</p><p>But the mass adoption we all hoped for? It relies on the 99% of people who have zero appetite for such trauma.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-revolution-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies\"><strong><em>An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</em></strong></a></p><p>If permissionless blockchains are to become the backbone of our online experiences, three major changes need to happen:</p><ol><li>They need to be free.</li><li>They need to be frictionless.</li><li>They need to be familiar.</li></ol><p>“Free” means free for the user, “frictionless” means as easy as opening an app or playing a video game, and “familiar” means we need to stop asking regular people to change their behavior to meet the limitations of our tech. We need to meet them where they already are.</p><p>Right now, we are zero for three. In fact, we’re so far away from where we need to be that we’re not even trying to address these problems seriously — we’re busy making small, incremental improvements to dysfunctional tech rather than addressing the root of the dysfunction itself.</p><h2>Free to use</h2><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/layer-1-blockchains-how-crypto-winter-could-slow-the-challenge-to-ethereum\">Layer-1 blockchains</a> have been designed, built and funded by people who figure that their value is in directly monetizing the user.</p><p>This is a fallacy.</p><p>Google serves you ads. It monetizes you indirectly. Facebook monetizes your data, but it doesn’t charge you to use its platform. Apple’s store takes a 30% cut from developers and publishers, not from you.</p><p>In all cases, you’re paying — just not with cash.</p><p>Google is visited 85 billion times a month. If it monetized directly, charging just one-tenth of one cent for visiting its homepage<em> </em>could theoretically pull in $85 million every single month.</p><p>But it doesn’t do that, as the pool of people who want to pay for the Google experience with cash is infinitesimally small compared with those who are fine with Google serving them ads and keeping it free.</p><p>We are used to being monetized indirectly. Yet current blockchain protocols monetize us directly, asking us to pay gas fees for each transaction.</p><p>One of the most exciting premises of Web3 is that it creates the possibility for aligned incentives between creators and consumers. Countless <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world\">nonfungible token (NFT)</a> creators have found ways to grow communities around such incentives — but layer-1 blockchain builders just keep doing the same thing, over and over again.</p><p>No matter how small their fees get, thanks to incremental reductions from the likes of Solana or the myriad layer 2s out there, it’s still a fee that most people won’t pay.</p><h2>Frictionless and simple</h2><p>We are not very loyal to our apps. Around 77% of daily active users abandon Android apps within three days. Estimates <a href=\"https://uplandsoftware.com/localytics/resources/blog/25-of-users-abandon-apps-after-one-use/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">suggest</a> that 25% of all downloaded apps are abandoned within minutes due to poor onboarding.</p><p>Andrew Chen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz investing in games, metaverse and consumer tech, <a href=\"https://andrewchen.com/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">shared</a> the following graph.

Crypto is the most user-unfriendly technology ever hawked to the public. To those who struggle with tech, it’s the digital equivalent of being punched repeatedly in the face. </p><p>By Mike Tyson.</p><p>In his heyday.</p><p>Over time, crypto has not become much friendlier. You, dear reader, are enjoying a specialist publication. You’re probably a degen with a liquidity position on Uniswap and a Milady in cold storage —<em> </em>but the words in that sentence make no sense to a normal person.</p><p>So, blockchain has to change. It has to become a frictionless experience, a background technology, like everything else we use — from the internet to our phones to our TVs. </p><p>We don’t care how they work. We just care that they work.</p><h2>Familiar and fun</h2><p>Lastly, and perhaps my single biggest critique of the crypto industry, is how utterly nonchalant we have come about asking billions of people to do things they don’t really want to do.</p><p>Crypto has not been good at creating decentralized social media alternatives to Facebook. It has not been good at creating unique gaming experiences. It has not been good at replacing traditional supplier-user Web2 models with aligned-incentive Web3 models.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-crushed-liquid-staking-tokens\"><strong><em>Ethereum is about to get crushed by liquid staking tokens</em></strong></a></p><p>It has been good at monkey pictures, scams, arguing on Twitter and speculative trading.</p><p>This is not to say that crypto is of no use — it absolutely is. The economic models that crypto enables will eventually be seen as a defining shift in power structures and personal autonomy, if we stop replicating the financial system and inequality that made crypto necessary in the first place.</p><p>But only if we make it as easy to use as opening an app or clearing a level in a game, because that’s what people actually do in real life.</p><h2>This is all silly, impossible and just wishful thinking — right?</h2><p>None of this is impossible.</p><p>We’ve just been conditioned to believe it is, as a few people have become very, very rich by promoting pay-to-use foundational blockchains that have niche appeal at best.</p><p>Ethereum is a wonderful innovation that will continue to serve as the foundation for decentralized finance precisely because it is secure, decentralized and slow-moving. However, it’s not going to revolutionize gaming, as gamers will not pay gas fees. Period.</p><p>Solana is great for NFTs, maybe even for stablecoins, but it won’t work for smart cities or the Internet of Things.</p><p>It’s time for the blockchain industry to acknowledge that our path toward becoming a foundation for consumer tech is blocked by these fundamental truths:</p><ul><li>People don’t want to pay for what should be free.</li></ul><ul><li>They don’t want to do difficult things that should be easy.</li></ul><ul><li>They don’t want to change their behavior to fit our vision of the world.</li></ul><p>The sooner we build protocols and applications that accept these realities, the sooner we silence the critics and change the world.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Jon Rice</strong> is the founder of the Koinos Federation, an alliance of projects building on the free-to-use Koinos blockchain.

However, it’s not all negative across the board, with several altcoins are showing signs of recovery in the near term.</p><p>Could Bitcoin shake out from its slumber and start a bullish move in the near term? Would that act as a catalyst for an altcoin rally? Let’s look at the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that may lead the charge higher.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls have managed to sustain Bitcoin’s price above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $26,523, but they have failed to start a strong rebound. This indicates a lack of demand at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/ca3ef891-2d34-464e-b1fb-bdc48ecb8c35.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint show a status of equilibrium between the buyers and sellers. A break below the 20-day EMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The BTC/USDT pair could then descend to the formidable support at $24,800.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price rises from the current level and climbs above the 50-day simple moving average of $26,948, it will signal that buyers are back in the driver’s seat. The pair may then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $28,143.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/e171279b-594f-4b23-8104-690544b0cccf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>While BTC has been trading below the moving averages on the 4-hour chart, the bears have failed to start a downward move. This suggests that selling is drying up at lower levels. Meanwhile, the bulls will try to propel Bitcoin’s price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $27,400 and subsequently to $28,143.</p><p>If the bears want to seize control, they will have to sink and sustain BTC’s price below $26,200. That could first yank it down to $25,750 and then to the $24,800 support level.</p><h2>Chainlink price analysis</h2><p>Chainlink (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/chainlink-price-index\">LINK</a>) surged above the downtrend line on Sept. 22, indicating a potential trend change in the near term. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/fab5b6ed-1679-4fc5-b2ff-b04f37f0ba6b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the buyers have the upper hand. On any correction, the bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA of $6.55. A strong rebound off this level will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. </p><p>The bulls will then try to extend the up-move to $8 and eventually to $8.50. If the bears want to prevent tha up-move, they will have to sink and sustain the LINK/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/212a2a3a-91d5-4484-b8a1-f6884f00396b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ALINKUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Both moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive zone. The bulls have been buying the dips to the 20-EMA, indicating a positive sentiment. If LINK’s price rebounds off the 20-EMA, $7.60 will then be the upside target to watch.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if Chainlink’s price continues lower and skids below the 20-EMA, it will signal profit-booking by the bulls. LINK may then retest the breakout level from the downtrend line. The bears will have to sink it below $6.60 to be back in control.</p><h2>Maker price analysis</h2><p>Maker (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/maker-price-index\">MKR</a>) turned down from the overhead resistance at $1,370 on Sept. 21, indicating that the bears are trying to defend the level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/243ca586-8c21-4d81-9e83-cc505d66ea55.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA of $1,226 is the support to watch for the downside. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that lower levels are continuing to attract buyers. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive MKR’s price above the overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the MKR/USDT pair could accelerate toward $1,759.</p><p>Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. That could keep the pair range-bound between $980 and $1,370 for a few days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/775b2f72-2483-4ddd-aa81-c2f72c8c7c8d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MKR/USDT 4-hour chart.

If buyers shove the price above $1,306, the MKR price could sprint toward $1,370.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $1,264, it will suggest that the selling pressure is increasing. That could clear the path for a further decline to $1,225. A slide below this support may tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.</p><h2>Arbitrum price analysis</h2><p>Arbitrum (ARB) is in a downtrend. The bears are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA of $0.85, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground. This suggests that the bulls are trying to hold on to their positions, as they anticipate a move higher.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/c5e74565-e20b-4c7c-aaec-2154df399071.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The RSI has risen above 40, indicating that the momentum is gradually turning positive. If buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The ARB/USDT pair could first rally to the 50-day SMA of $0.95 and thereafter to $1.04.</p><p>The support on the downside is $0.80 and then $0.78. Sellers will have to drag ARB’s price below this zone to make room for a retest of the support near $0.74. A break below this level will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/60f34baa-3b4c-4ac3-8cda-ca2418dd28a8.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AARBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling the rallies to the downtrend line. The bears pulled the price below the moving averages but could not sink ARB below the immediate support at $0.81. This suggests that the bulls are trying to form a higher low.</p><p>Buyers will again try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, Arbitrum’s price is likely to start a strong recovery toward the psychological level of $1. Contrarily, a break below $0.81 can tug ARB price to $0.78 and subsequently to $0.74.</p><h2>Theta Network price analysis</h2><p>Theta Network (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/theta-price-index\">THETA</a>) soared above the 20-day EMA of $0.61 on Sept. 23, indicating that the bulls have absorbed the supply and are attempting a comeback. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/604babbc-f59d-43ef-8836-bd09e847bf8e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THETA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/jDQu9g33/?symbol=BINANCE%3ATHETAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears have pulled the price back below the 50-day SMA of $0.64, but the bulls are expected to defend the 20-day EMA. If THETA price turns up from the current level and climbs above the 50-day SMA, it will enhance the prospects of a retest of $0.70. </p><p>This is an important level to keep an eye on because if it is scaled, the THETA/USDT pair may reach $0.76. This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA. That opens the door for a potential retest of $0.57.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/66d572dd-e85c-47fb-8005-966e2bb8e1aa.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>THETA/USDT 4-hour chart.

If buyers want to sustain the bullish momentum, they will have to drive THETA above $0.65. If they do that, the pair is likely to start a new up-move toward $0.70.</p><p>The 20-day EMA is the important support to watch for on the downside. If bears sink the price below this support, it will indicate that the bulls are closing their positions. The pair may then descend toward the $0.58 support.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But how can someone buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is Dubai crypto-friendly? </p><p>Here’s a quick guide with the answers. The great news is that, yes, buying Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) in the United Arab Emirates is permitted, and the country is actually one of the most welcoming to cryptocurrency exchanges and investors.</p><h2>Is Dubai crypto-friendly?</h2><p>The thriving metropolis of Dubai in the UAE has long been deemed a crypto-friendly city. Some describe the UAE as the most <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/where-crypto-can-grow-digital-asset-regulations-around-the-world\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/where-crypto-can-grow-digital-asset-regulations-around-the-world/amp\">crypto-friendly</a> country. </p><p>What’s more, there is zero tax to pay on cryptocurrency trading in the UAE, as well as zero income or capital gains tax. This combination has made the Middle Eastern country massively attractive to cryptocurrency and blockchain companies and the users of these technologies. There are many UAE crypto traders and plenty of crypto investment options in the UAE. </p><p>But is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Dubai and the UAE have some regulations on cryptocurrencies, including policies to protect investors. Cryptocurrencies are not licensed or recognized as legal tender; however, there are no laws against buying Bitcoin in the UAE or owning or trading Bitcoin or other crypto. </p><h2>How to buy cryptocurrency in Dubai</h2><p>Buying Bitcoin in Dubai and anywhere in the UAE is quite straightforward; it starts with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/10-key-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-crypto-exchange\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/10-key-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-crypto-exchange/amp\">choosing a crypto exchange</a>, registering and creating an account, and then adding the funds needed to buy the cryptocurrency of choice. </p><p>Bitcoin is available on any exchange, and other leading cryptocurrencies are available on most major exchanges. Investors who plan to hold on to Bitcoin usually want to move their Bitcoin away from an exchange into a Bitcoin wallet or to more secure Bitcoin storage like a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-a-crypto-hardware-wallet\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-a-crypto-hardware-wallet/amp\">hardware wallet</a>. Let’s look at the steps to buying Bitcoin in the United Arab Emirates: </p><h3>1. Choose an exchange</h3><p>The first priority when choosing an exchange is security; crypto buyers should always research the exchange and check online reviews, then review the coins, the exchange lists and the fees.</p><h3>2. Register</h3><p>Registering with an exchange starts with an email, a password and any other security authentication available. Cryptocurrency exchange users should always make full use of any additional security options. New exchange users will usually need to provide the exchange with an image of a piece of photo ID to complete its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it\">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> checks.</p><h3>3. Fund and buy</h3><p>Once an account has been created, funds can be added from fiat accounts. After that, it’s possible to buy BTC with UAE dirhams easily this way or to select another trading pair. </p><h3>Which crypto exchanges operate in Dubai and the UAE?</h3><p>The intriguing thing is that there are many leading exchanges that operate in the UAE; investors can pick from the most well-known, the best-reviewed, those thought of as the safest, and those with the highest availability of leading cryptocurrencies. </p><p>Some of the crypto exchanges and Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai and the UAE are eToro, OKX, HTX (formerly Huobi) and Binance. Bitcoin brokers in the UAE, such as Rain, OKX, Uphold, Bybit and Binance, are regulated by the UAE Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) or the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).</p><h3>How to choose Bitcoin wallets in Dubai</h3><p>Just like Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai, there are lots of options for Bitcoin wallets in Dubai to store crypto safely. The first step is to choose a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-btc\">Bitcoin wallet</a> suitable for investor plans or behavior. </p><p>Online wallets or wallet applications aren’t as safe as hardware wallets, but they can be more suitable for investors planning to move their cryptocurrency holdings or use them on a regular basis. Hot wallets to choose from include Trust Wallet or Electrum. </p><p>More valuable Bitcoin holdings or funds left idle for some time are best stored in safer <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-a-crypto-hardware-wallet\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-a-crypto-hardware-wallet/amp\">hardware wallets</a>, such as Trezor or Ledger Nano. </p><h3>Can you buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash?</h3><p>It’s possible to buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash straight from an account or by using a credit card. After an account has been set up with an exchange, the next step is to add fiat money funds to the account and then go on to purchase Bitcoin. </p><h3>Does Dubai have Bitcoin ATMs?</h3><p>The UAE is so welcoming to crypto that it is one of the countries to have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-atms-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-teller-machines\">Bitcoin ATMs</a>, and Dubai’s first Bitcoin ATM was installed at the five-star Rixos Premium Dubai Hotel in 2019. At the kiosk, visitors can insert cash and buy Bitcoin instantly. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/5c6a3818-30f0-41ce-a581-908eabb02bbe.jpg\"></figure><h3>Is buying Bitcoin via P2P in Dubai common?</h3><p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to trade Bitcoin directly with one another, unlike centralized or decentralized exchanges. On a P2P exchange, it’s possible to look at a seller’s list of assets for sale and choose accordingly. Buyers and sellers agree on the price of the cryptocurrency for sale before the sale is made. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges/amp\">P2P exchanges</a> can be more common in countries with greater restrictions on cryptocurrency exchanges; in Dubai, that’s not the case. The major exchanges operating in Dubai often have P2P functionality as well as standard trading options, which provides the best of both worlds. The exchanges offering P2P trading in Dubai include Binance, Paxful, OKX, HTX, Bybit and KuCoin. </p><h2>Are there crypto-friendly banks in the UAE?</h2><p>It is interesting to know how banks in Dubai and the UAE view cryptocurrencies and crypto users. The UAE doesn’t fail the crypto entrepreneur, and there are a number of crypto-friendly banks in the UAE that will allow crypto businesses to open and use fiat accounts. </p><p>First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has no policies restricting its customers from buying and selling crypto. Although it doesn’t offer <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-the-ultimate-beginners-guide\">crypto trading</a>, it’s possible to link an FAB account with a crypto exchange to fund Bitcoin purchases. FAB also has future plans to leverage Web3 and digital assets for its users. </p><h2>Exercise caution while dealing with cryptocurrencies</h2><p>It is fortunate for Dubai residents to have access to a vibrant financial environment that enables them to engage with the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template><p>However, it is important to remember that the value of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile and subject to significant <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/volatility\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/tags/volatility/amp\">price swings in either direction</a>. Therefore, before entering the cryptocurrency market, careful research and knowledge of the risks involved are crucial.</p>\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

After the exchange filed a lawsuit in the Victoria Supreme Court, the judge ruled that the funds should be returned to the crypto trading platform. </p><p>However, the couple had allegedly already gone on a spending spree before the mistake was discovered. The couple had reportedly bought four houses, vehicles and other items, as well as sending around 4 million AU$ to a Malaysian bank account. One of the houses is a five-bedroom property in Craigieburn worth 1.35 million AU$, which was ordered by the court to be sold and the funds returned. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/4cd3f00f-5e5a-4529-b51c-17cc3e8c722c.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>1.35 million AU$ property bought by the couple.

Ardoino added that the event was an authorization and not an actual issuance, with the allocated amount set to serve as inventory for upcoming issuance requests and chain swaps from the Tron network.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ftx-founder-s-parents-sued-accused-of-stealing-millions-from-crypto-exchange\"><strong>FTX founders parents sued, accused of stealing millions from crypto exchange</strong></h2><p>Debtors of FTX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-parents-sued-accused-stole-millions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >have launched legal action</a> against the parents Sam SBF Bankman-Fried, alleging that they misappropriated millions of dollars through their involvement in the crypto exchange. The plaintiffs argued that Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried exploited their access and influence within the FTX empire to enrich themselves at the expense of the debtors in the FTX bankruptcy estate. The debtors alleged that SBFs parents were very much involved in the FTX business from inception to collapse, contrary to what SBF has claimed.

Traders buy near the lower band and sell near the upper band.</p>\n                    <p><p>A technical analysis tool called Bollinger Bands uses price volatility to provide probable entry and exit opportunities in trading. They are made up of<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/cryptocurrency-investment-the-ultimate-indicators-for-crypto-trading\"> two outer bands or lines and a centerline</a> (the simple moving average for a 20-day period), which enlarges and contracts in response to changes in price. For thorough market analysis, they are frequently utilized in conjunction with other technical indicators.</p><h2>Bollinger Bands, explained</h2><p>Bollinger Bands were created by John Bollinger in the 1980s. They are a useful<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-charts-101-how-to-read-cryptocurrency-charts\"> technical analysis tool</a> used in<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-the-ultimate-beginners-guide\"> cryptocurrency trading</a> and other financial markets to evaluate price volatility, pinpoint probable reversal points, and make trading decisions. </p><p>The three bands that help construct a Bollinger Band include:</p><h3>Upper band</h3><p>The upper band is created by multiplying the middle band by the price’s standard deviation. A price’s volatility is quantified by the standard deviation. Traders often use a multiplier of 2 for the standard deviation (SD), but this can be changed depending on the state of the market and personal preferences.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/54159022-0aa7-42ae-b32f-b8967625fe57.jpg\"></figure><h3>Middle band (SMA)</h3><p>The middle band typically represents the price of the asset over a given period as a simple moving average (SMA). It serves as the axis and depicts the average price of the cryptocurrency within the selected time frame.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/6b3896be-7129-4959-83ac-5c7c160eecac.jpg\"></figure><h3>Lower band</h3><p>From the middle band, a multiple of the standard deviation is subtracted to determine the lower band.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/0080361f-aa5b-425b-b0d1-5bda1fef9d6e.jpg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/3973c3ba-8865-4214-8bb7-d862a5065ed4.jpg\"></figure><h2>The purpose of Bollinger Bands in cryptocurrency trading</h2><p>In cryptocurrency trading, Bollinger Bands serve as a crucial technical analysis technique that allows traders to:</p><h3>Assess price volatility</h3><p>Traders can assess the degree of price volatility in the cryptocurrency market using Bollinger Bands. When the bands widen, there may be trading possibilities because it suggests higher volatility. On the other hand, a contraction of the bands denotes less volatility and the potential for price consolidation or trend reversals.</p><h3>Identify overbought and oversold conditions</h3><p>Bollinger Bands are used to detect possible overbought and oversold scenarios, helping traders identify them. A potential sell opportunity arises when the price reaches or exceeds the upper band, which is a sign that the price is overbought. On the other hand, if the price reaches or drops beneath the lower band, it can be considered oversold, indicating a potential purchase opportunity.</p><h3>Determine trend direction</h3><p>Traders may use Bollinger Bands to ascertain the prevailing trend direction. The price may indicate an uptrend if it constantly moves along the top band. On the other hand, if it frequently touches or remains close to the lower band, it can be a sign of a downtrend.</p><h3>Generate reverse signals</h3><p>Bollinger Bands can be used to create reversal signals, which are indicators of possible trend reversals. For instance, a possible reversal from an overextended condition may be indicated when the price moves outside the bands and then reenters (below the lower band for a downtrend or above the upper band for an uptrend).</p><h2>How are Bollinger Bands constructed?</h2><p>The simple moving average and standard deviation are the two basic building blocks of Bollinger Bands and are used in their construction. These bands offer insightful information on price volatility and possible trading opportunities in the cryptocurrency markets.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to constructing Bollinger Bands:</p><h3>Step one: Calculate the SMA</h3><p>Depending on their trading technique, traders choose a particular time frame for analysis, such as daily, hourly or another timeframe. For the selected time frame, previous closing prices for the cryptocurrency under examination are gathered. Since it indicates the last traded price at the conclusion of each time period, the closing price is frequently employed.</p><p>By adding up the closing prices for the chosen time period and dividing the total by the number of data points, the SMA is calculated. For instance, if traders were examining a cryptocurrency’s daily closing prices over a 20-day period, they would add up the closing prices from the previous 20 days, divide by 20, and then find the SMA for that day.</p><h3>Step two: Calculate the SD</h3><p>Traders determine the standard deviation of the closing prices during the same time period after computing the SMA. The standard deviation, which is crucial for assessing price volatility in cryptocurrency markets, quantifies the dispersion or variability of prices from the SMA.</p><h3>Step three: Construct the upper and lower Bollinger Bands</h3><p>The higher Bollinger Band is created by multiplying the SMA by the standard deviation. A typical multiplier is 2, although (as mentioned) this can be changed depending on the preferences of the traders and the state of the market. The same multiple of the SD is subtracted from the SMA to arrive at the lower Bollinger Band.</p><h3>Step four: Plotting the Bollinger Bands on a price chart</h3><p>Traders can plot the SMA, standard deviation, upper Bollinger Band and lower Bollinger Band on a price chart after calculating them. The centerline of the Bollinger Bands and the SMA is represented by the middle line. Plotting the upper and lower bands above and below the SMA creates a channel that encircles the price chart.</p><h3>Step five: Interpretation</h3><p>To understand how to use Bollinger Bands to trade cryptocurrencies, it is vital to interpret the price signals. For instance, when the price reaches or swings outside the upper band, it may signal an overbought condition and an opportunity to sell.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/6c7c7a01-381f-4ce2-86a9-3901443b9450.jpg\"></figure><p>On the other hand, if the price touches or swings outside the lower band, it can be a sign that the market is oversold, presenting a potential buying opportunity. The bands’ breadth provides information on market volatility; broader bands denote higher volatility, while narrower bands denote lesser volatility.</p><h2>Crypto trading strategies with Bollinger Bands</h2><p>Various<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-trading-strategies\"> crypto trading strategies</a> using Bollinger Bands used by traders include:</p><h3>The Bollinger Band Squeeze strategy for crypto</h3><p>The Bollinger Band Squeeze approach is based on the idea that times of low volatility in crypto prices (referred to as a “squeeze”) are frequently followed by periods of high volatility (referred to as an “expansion”). It works as follows:</p><ul><li>Find the squeeze: Watch for times when the Bollinger Bands narrow and move in closer proximity, a sign of decreased price volatility.</li><li>Prepare for a breakout: After a squeeze, traders expect a strong price change. They don’t foresee the breakout’s direction, but they do get ready for it.</li><li>Entry points: Traders enter positions following price breakouts from Bollinger Bands (above upper band for up, below lower band for down), often using additional confirmation indicators, such as volume.</li><li>Stop-loss and take-profit: Implement<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-trading-basics-a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-order-types\"> stop-loss orders to limit potential losses</a> if the breakout fails to hold and set<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-taking-crypto-profits-and-reinvesting\"> take-profit levels</a> according to one’s trading strategy.</li></ul><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/5bb64495-5611-4c71-847a-a15f75088f3f.jpg\"></figure><h3>Bollinger Bands for setting entry and exit points in crypto trades</h3><p>When trading cryptocurrencies, whether for short-term investments or<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/day-trading-vs-long-term-cryptocurrency-hodling-benefits-and-drawbacks\"> day trading</a>, Bollinger Bands can be utilized to<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-technical-analysis-strategies-that-help-confirm-winning-trades\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/3-technical-analysis-strategies-that-help-confirm-winning-trades/amp\"> find the best entry and exit points</a>.</p><p><strong>Entry points</strong></p><p>When the price reaches or breaks below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating an oversold scenario, traders might seek buy signals. In contrast, they view overbought conditions as sell signals when the price reaches or exceeds the upper Bollinger Band. However, it could be necessary to do more technical investigation and validation.</p><p><strong>Exit points</strong></p><p>Bollinger Bands can be used by traders to determine when to close out a position. For instance, it may be an indication to take profits if traders are long on a cryptocurrency, and the price is approaching the upper band. In contrast, it might be time to close out the trade if they are short, and the price is getting close to the lower band.</p><h3>Combining Bollinger Bands with other trading indicators</h3><p>Bollinger Bands are frequently used by traders together with other indicators to complement their trading strategies.</p><p><strong>Bollinger Bands and RSI</strong></p><p>Combining Bollinger Bands and the<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/the-most-common-crypto-metrics-a-beginners-guide\"> relative strength index (RSI)</a> might aid traders in spotting probable reversals. A probable slump may be indicated, for instance, if the price is nearing the upper Bollinger Band and the RSI shows overbought circumstances.</p><p><strong>Volume analysis</strong></p><p>Bollinger Bands and<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/on-chain-volume-vs-trading-volume-differences-explained\"> analysis of trading volume</a> can be used to corroborate price fluctuations. An increase in volume during a Bollinger Band breakout might strengthen the signal’s validity.</p><p><strong>Bollinger Bands and moving averages</strong></p><p>Moving averages are used in combination with Bollinger Bands by traders to add more context to trend analysis. Bollinger Bands and a moving average crossover approach, for instance, can support the confirmation of trend changes.</p><h2>Limitations of Bollinger Bands for crypto traders</h2><p>Bollinger Bands are a useful tool for cryptocurrency traders, but they also have some drawbacks. Firstly, they might produce false signals during times of minimal volatility or in markets that are moving strongly, which could result in losses. Secondly, traders must utilize other indicators or analysis techniques to confirm trend direction since they do not provide directional information on their own.</p><p>The efficacy of Bollinger Bands might also vary across different cryptocurrencies and timeframes. Additionally, unexpected market news or occurrences may result in price gaps that aren’t necessarily reflected in the bands, which may catch traders off guard.</p><h2>Risk management strategies when using Bollinger Bands</h2><p>As with any technical indicator, Bollinger Bands must be used by cryptocurrency traders in conjunction with thorough risk management and analysis. To reduce possible losses in the event that transactions go against them, traders should set up explicit stop-loss orders.</p><p>Position sizing is also essential; to avoid overexposure, traders should also allocate a certain amount of their cash to each trade. Moreover, risk can be reduced by diversifying among different cryptocurrencies and limiting the percentage of one’s entire capital that can be lost in a single trade.</p><p>Finally, Bollinger Bands should always be used in conjunction with other indicators for confirmation, as well as larger market patterns. Long-term success with Bollinger Bands depends on maintaining discipline and following a clear risk management strategy.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The S21 has a hash rate of 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an efficiency of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/T), while the S21 hydro hashes at 335 TH/s and 16 J/T, which is notable given that until recently, most Bitcoin ASICS were operating above the 20 J/T level.</p><p>With electricity costs continuing to rise year-over-year and the Bitcoin halving projected to occur in April 2024, ASIC efficiency is quickly becoming the paramount focus of miners, and many are also pivoting toward folding in renewable energy sources as a core component of their operations. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/2a0298b7-5300-4cb8-a58f-2e7b4e285fed.png\"  /></figure><h2>Bitcoin miners focus on efficiency and renewable energy</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/yrMgo08Jpiw?si=1gyNk552lpjd0S4n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sustainable development in the mining industry</a> was a core theme discussed in a majority of the panels at the WDMS. In the opening roundtable, team members from Terrawulf, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Iris Energy shared their perspectives on how further integration of renewable energy sources will become a critical strategy to implement for many miners after the April 2024 Bitcoin supply halving. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/35073918-8fbd-4d39-9220-b97f11215c5b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitmain World Digital Mining Summit. Source: Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>According to Nazar Khan, Terrawulf’s chief operating officer:</p><blockquote>“There’s a significant transition going on in the supply side of the generation process; there’s a concerted effort to decarbonize the entire supply stack, and so when we talk about Bitcoin miners consuming more renewable energy, that’s part of a broader theme that’s happening across the United States without Bitcoin mining as well. The role that we play is locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that’s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.“</blockquote><p>One impact of the upcoming supply halving is that miners will maintain the same capital and operational costs, plus the need to pay down any revolving debts, while essentially seeing their block reward distribution cut in half. </p><p>For this reason, miners will either need to increase the percentage of their hash rate derived from sustainable energy sources or make efficiency adjustments to their ASIC fleet to maintain or increase their profitability. </p><p>Regarding the rollout of the Antminer S21 and its potential impact on the mining industry, BMC founder Justin Kramer said: </p><blockquote>“The S21, if reliable, fairly priced and readily available — and yes, that’s a lot of ifs with Bitmain’s history — could revolutionize the crypto mining landscape with its efficiency. It is basically packing the power of two S19 100T miners into one unit. Despite this, the burgeoning aftermarket firmware market, coupled with hydro/immersion systems, give miners more tools to keep older generation miners, such as the S19, profitable also. Thus, while the S21 represents a notable advancement, it may not render sub 110 TH/s miners entirely obsolete.”</blockquote><p>When asked about what else caught this eye from the S21 release, Kramer noted that: </p><blockquote>“I like that Bitmain is rewarding environmentally friendly mining farms with better pricing and advanced delivery with their new Carbon Neutral Certificate. But, I’ll add that, it was a little surprising when I noticed that both new S21 models offer 33% more hash rate (S21 200T versus 151T on S19j XP; S21 hydro is 335T versus the S19 XP Hydro at 257T). Is this a coincidence? I’m doubtful, and it likely signals more of the same systematic model releases from Bitmain where a slight tweak to the firmware and maybe a few other items that are adjusted results in a moderate increase in hash rate and a brand-new miner.”</blockquote><h2>Bitcoin is en route to becoming an ESG asset</h2><p>A theme of the past few years has been an increase in Bitcoin miners and BTC advocates pushing back against the assertion that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, and that the industry’s reliance on carbon-based energy production accelerates emissions. </p><p>Countering this perspective, Hong Kong Sustaintech Foundation professor in accounting and finance, Haitian Lu, bluntly announced that: </p><blockquote>“Bitcoin mining is promoting renewable energy adoption in many areas.”</blockquote><p>Lu explained that “over the years, Bitcoin mining has become more efficient and is also using cleaner energy. History tells us that human development from an agricultural society to industrialization to the future of a digitalized economy goes with every increasing energy consumption per capita. What makes the difference is human’s ability to use renewable energy increases, thus achieving sustainable development.” </p><p>Like the perspectives shared by other panelists, Lu said that Bitcoin miners’ participation in demand response agreements with power producers and distributors leads to energy grid efficiency, and they “provide an economic incentive for the development of renewable energy “promotion and development of renewable energy projects.” </p><p>In addition to Bitcoin mining tapping into stranded energy, encouraging the development of renewable energy projects and helping to balance electric grids, the efficiency advancements of next-generation ASICs like the Antminer S21 reduce miners’ energy consumption while also allowing them to boost their profits. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

He delayed its launch to fine-tune it before eventually rolling it out in May 2022 as the crypto and NFT markets crashed. </p><p>With floor prices and sales stagnant after the launch, Murakami <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/takashi-murakami-nft-collapse-2131025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-amp=\"https://news-artnet-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/news.artnet.com/market/takashi-murakami-nft-collapse-2131025/amp-page\">ultimately</a> apologized to those who bought his NFTs. However, the community seemed to understand at the time, given that broader market factors were at play. </p><p>Despite this, Murakami.Flowers has generated 26,713 Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) or $42.52 million worth of secondary trading volume to date, with an NFT floor price of 0.36 ETH ($573) according to data from OpenSea. </p><h3>NFT artist wins multimillion-dollar contract dispute</h3><p>NFT artist Danny Casale, also known as Coolman Coffeedan, has won a multimillion-dollar profit-sharing related contract dispute with Web3 art curators DigiArt.</p><p><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/nft-artist-scores-big-win-in-multimillion-dollar-contract-dispute-over-a-blank-space-2366847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-amp=\"https://news-artnet-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/news.artnet.com/art-world/nft-artist-scores-big-win-in-multimillion-dollar-contract-dispute-over-a-blank-space-2366847/amp-page\">According</a> to a Sept. 22 report from  ArtNet, Casale signed on to be repped by DigiArt back in May 2021, with  the firm helping him gain exposure in exchange for a 50-50 split of his  NFT sales and the exclusive “right to market and offer for sale <em>all </em>non-fungible tokens created by Casale” up until the contract expired on May 2, 2022.</p><p>However, DigiArt sued Casale in March 2023 over an alleged breach of contract after the artist launched an NFT project by himself on Dec. 21, 2021, called<em> </em>Coolman’s Universe.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/5d9a60e2-7844-4552-98bf-c3107c322e73.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Coolman’s Universe NFTs.

Some of the firm’s subsidiaries, which also deal in digital assets, have successfully registered with the SEC.</p><p>“Prometheum was purpose-built to comply with federal securities laws and create the first digital asset security trading platform subject to those laws, including investor protection rules,” Kaplan told Cointelegraph. </p><p>Kaplan’s approach would seem to suggest that certain firms like Coinbase, Binance and Ripple launched services in the U.S. with the intention of trying to change existing regulations. Major players have sometimes lobbied for legislation favorable to crypto firms: Coinbase CEO <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/brian-armstrong\">Brian Armstrong</a> has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/dc-doesnt-realize-how-powerful-crypto-voting-is-brian-armstrong\">been a regular presence in Washington DC</a> and encouraged users to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-voters-oppose-anti-crypto-president-poll-crypto-exchange-coinbase\">back political candidates</a> in support of pro-crypto policies. </p><p>According to the Prometheum co-CEO, certain crypto companies “have been working to rewrite or amend existing laws in their favor and to the detriment of retail investors,” speculating that the current frameworks are incapable of dealing with digital assets. Many industry leaders and lawmakers have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/impossible-to-know-what-is-a-security-mark-cuban-on-sec\">echoed similar concerns</a>, claiming crypto firms in the U.S. have an uphill battle in recognizing what digital assets qualify as securities.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Four key proposed bills could redefine digital asset regulations. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Prometheum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Prometheum</a> remains at the forefront with plans to offer regulated trading &amp; custody of digital assets.

However, the approval has led to calls to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmakers-allege-ccp-connection-sec-doj-investigation-prometheum\">investigate the firm</a> by advocacy groups, including the Blockchain Association and crypto-minded members of Congress.</p><p>“We are concerned that the [SEC] granted Prometheum a ‘sweetheart’ deal in exchange for support of the Commission’s policy goals or that Prometheum is leveraging personal connections with the Commission to gain an unfair advantage in the market,” <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-association-calls-for-investigation-prometheum-sweetheart-sec-deal\">said</a> the Blockchain Association in July. “Most significantly, we are concerned that Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process as a means to thwart congressional efforts toward legislation by continuing to spread the false narrative that the law is already clear with regard to digital asset securities.”</p><p>Kaplan added:</p><blockquote>“From the moment Prometheum received its SPBD license, there was a seemingly concerted effort by various industry associations and lawmakers to discredit the more than 6 years of hard work we have put in to build our company.“</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-chanpgeng-zhao-asks-court-dismiss-sec-lawsuit\"><strong><em>Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao ask court to dismiss SEC suit</em></strong></a></p><p>It’s unclear if Prometheum’s approach will work for existing players in the space in an effort to sidestep enforcement actions or for up-and-coming projects aware of the regulatory challenges in the United States. David Hirsch, head of the SEC’s crypto enforcement division, reportedly said at a Sept. 19 conference that though the commission was currently embroiled in several civil lawsuits, it would continue to bring actions against firms it saw as violating U.S. securities laws — including decentralized finance projects.</p><p>Gensler will be testifying before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Sept. 27 in a hearing on SEC oversight.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital and Atlas Merchant Capital are jostling with the San Francisco firm Vector Capital in the final stages of the bidding process. Sources claimed that SVB’s venture capital arm could be sold off for between $250 million and $500 million but warned that a final sale is not guaranteed and would still require the review of the creditor’s committee. SVB Capital conducts a wide range of investments, including backing other major venture capital firms, such as Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz. The company is not part of SVB’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and a decision on the sale is expected in the coming weeks.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/28054799-f76a-4736-9e53-f30177a757a4.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SVB Capital holdings overview as of December 2022.

    "description": "It has been a quiet week of caution for Bitcoin traders in terms of price action. This caution has trickled into trading volume in particular, as volumes on major crypto exchanges for both spot Bitcoin trading and Bitcoin derivatives have fallen far below their levels at the beginning of the year. On-chain data from CryptoQuant charts have shown the daily spot and derivatives trading volume of Bitcoin has been steadily declining since the first quarter of the year. The question is, what does this collapse in trading volumes mean for the future price of Bitcoin? Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty Decline In Trading Volumes  Trading volumes this year have declined significantly from their highs in March during the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco. Since this period, the derivatives or futures market has fallen 96% and the spot market has fallen 98%. Bitcoin trading in particular, has been down by a significant margin the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap has shown Bitcoin spot trading volume has decreased by 33.67% in a 24-hour timeframe. Similarly, the spot exchange trade volume was shown by CryptoQuant data to be 9,627, down 81% from 50,692 at the beginning of the week. The situation looks even more glaring when you consider falling derivatives volumes as well. On-chain data collected by CryptoQuant indicates that the derivatives trade volume is currently at 108,852. This represents a decrease of 88% from the volume of 950,331 at the beginning of the week. The market cap of cryptocurrencies is currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com What Does This Mean For The Price Of Bitcoin? When activity in these markets dwindles, it signals a lack of interest from institutional traders and retail investors. With interest seeming to wane, the next few weeks could determine Bitcoin&#8217;s near-term direction. As the largest cryptocurrency in the world, this could also determine the direction of the majority of the crypto market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,556. Without much trading activity to drive prices up, Bitcoin could continue trading sideways or even face downward pressure. The next major support for Bitcoin is at $25,000, and a fall below this price could indicate a prolonged bearish trend with increased selling pressure.  Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Another way this could go is the lower price eventually leading to higher volumes again as investors see an opportunity to buy. According to a social media post by crypto analyst Captain Faibik, Bitcoin could reach as low as $23,000 in October before breaking out to reach $34,500 by early next year. Similarly, Didar Bekbauov, founder and CEO of Bitcoin joint mining business Xive, stated that the price of Bitcoin could soar past the year-to-date (YTD) price of $31,700 while speaking to Bitcoinist.

    "description": "Coinbase’s layer 2 scaling solution, called Base, has seem a meteoric rise in popularity recently. In just six short weeks since its launch, Base&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) has skyrocketed to nearly $400 million. This rapid rise in use and popularity has even seen it recently overtake the Solana blockchain in TVL.  Coinbase&#8217;s Layer 2 Scaling Network TVL Overtakes Solana  Base operates as a layer 2 network on Ethereum launched by Coinbase in collaboration with Optimism to offer a safe, low-cost, developer-friendly way to build on-chain. Since its launch, Base has managed to find a strong market fit, allowing it to quickly penetrate the crypto market. However, this hasn’t been without some hiccups. Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Before its public launch, Base had some glitches, which developers were able to rectify quickly. Earlier this month, the network faced another setback as block production unexpectedly stopped for 45 minutes. According to DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama, Base&#8217;s TVL has risen +111% in the past month to now holding more than $370.29 million.  Last week, Base&#8217;s growth saw it blow past the Solana blockchain in terms of transaction volume. This growth has continued, and the Layer-2 network has now moved ahead of Solana whose total value locked (TVL) dropped by 12.22% in the last month to $310 million. Also, this places Base&#8217;s TVL ahead of other popular chains like Cronos, Bitcoin, and Cardano. Crypto market cap currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart by TradingView.com Base Sees Massive Growth In Just 6 Weeks Base&#8217;s growth kickstarted with Aerodrome, a decentralized exchange, which deposited $190 million on the network after its launch. Base&#8217;s growth can also be attributed to the popularity of Friend.tech, a decentralized social app. With a current TVL of $38.6 million, Friend.tech is one of the projects native to Base with a the largest stake. Other projects with a considerable stake in TVL include Stargate, Curve DEX, and Compound V3. At the moment, Ethereum continues to lead the pack in terms of TVL. However, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether Base can sustain its momentum and continue gaining mainstream traction. At its current trajectory, Base could surpass $500 million in TVL in the coming weeks and solidify itself as a leader in layer-2 scaling networks.  Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty According to BaseScan, the number of daily transactions on Base reached a new high of 1.88 million on September 14, as reported by BaseScan.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/bitwise-ethereum-etfs/",
    "description": "In a recent development, asset manager Bitwise has withdrawn its application to transform its existing Bitcoin futures ETF (Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF) to one that invests in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.  This has raised speculations about the reason for this decision and what it means for the Ethereum futures ETFs projected to launch in October. Why Bitwise Withdrew Its Application Reporting this development on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart stated that the asset manager has chosen to maintain only its Bitcoin exposure following this move.  Related Reading: Major Milestones Shows XRP Ledger Is Becoming A DeFi Force To Be Reckoned With Many were more concerned about the reason for this decision. To clarify, Seyffart stated that the Asset manager may have made this decision simply because it doesn’t see the “benefit in having a dual BTC and ETH ETF,” especially considering that their Ethereum futures ETF is expected to launch only a few days after the first one launches.  Seyffart also believes the firm’s Optimum Roll ETF investors may have preferred only exposure to Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin and Ethereum, which prompted the decision.  This development comes after Bitwise had withdrawn its application for its Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF, which it filed with the SEC on August 3. The asset manager had made its decision known in a filing to the SEC dated August 31.  Meanwhile, the filing with the SEC to withdraw its Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF application is dated September 22. ETH price struggling to reclaim $1,600 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com What Now For Bitwise And Ethereum Futures ETF It is worth mentioning that Bitwise isn’t backing out of the Ethereum futures ETF race despite these recent developments. The asset manager still has its Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF application with the SEC, with the fund seeking to invest in Ethereum futures contracts.  The withdrawals have also not affected Seyffart’s optimism about the launch of several Ethereum futures ETFs in October as he believes there isn’t much meaning to read into the asset manager’s actions than it being “some sort of product decision.” Related Reading: Investment Firm Founder Has An Important Message For Bitcoin Holders He noted that the only time there may be reason for concern is if Valkyrie were to withdraw its application. Like Bitwise, Valkyrie had also applied to the SEC to transform its Bitcoin futures ETF (Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF) into a fund that invests in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.  Barring any denial by the SEC, asset managers like Volatility Shares, VanEck, ProShares, Roundhill, and even Bitwise are expected to launch their Ethereum futures ETF in October.  Based on their respective filing dates, Volatility Shares is set to gain a first-mover advantage, launching on October 12, while others are expected to launch after.  Featured image from Moneycontrol, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "XRP has maintained its position within the confines of a symmetrical triangle pattern, with today&#8217;s modest surge doing little to alter its trajectory. This symmetrical triangle pattern has exerted significant influence over XRP&#8217;s price movements for the past month, indicating that it may continue to dictate the coin&#8217;s fate in the near future. The symmetrical triangle pattern is a technical analysis chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, with one representing the coin&#8217;s lower highs and the other symbolizing its higher lows.  Related Reading: ImmutableX Makes Noise As IMX Dominates Top 50 Roster With 33% Climb This pattern suggests a period of consolidation and uncertainty in the market, as traders weigh the potential for a breakout in either direction. A Crucial Breakout Looms For XRP  Analysts suggest that a breakout from either side of the symmetrical triangle pattern could set the stage for a significant directional rally in XRP. Should the coin break above the upper trendline, it could potentially surge to a price of $0.55. As of now, XRP is trading at $0.512876, according to CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, it has recorded a modest increase of 1%, while its seven-day performance shows a 2.5% increase. Triangle Resistance Continues To Hold The report notes that the recent pullback in XRP marks the third instance where the price has retraced from the triangle&#8217;s upper trendline, underscoring the pattern&#8217;s dominance over this asset. Daily charts further emphasize this bearish sentiment, revealing an &#8220;Evening Star&#8221; pattern at the resistance, often seen as a precursor to potential downtrends. If sellers continue to dominate the market, XRP&#8217;s price may decline by approximately 6%, potentially pushing it down to the $0.485 level, which would serve as a retest of the triangle&#8217;s lower boundary. As long as XRP oscillates within these trendlines, its price is likely to remain range-bound. XRP market cap currently at $27.2 billion.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/bank-ceo-99-crypto/",
    "description": "In a bold and contentious statement, Caitlin Long has asserted that 99% of the crypto industry should be eliminated to decrease leverage buildup and improve the industry’s future advancement. Industry Overhaul Demanded For Sustainability Caitlin Long, Founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, a crypto asset banking company, has called for a seismic change in the crypto industry and its practices. The CEO emphatically suggested that only 1% of the crypto industry should be allowed to operate while 99% of the industry should be destroyed and the majority of crypto firms in the industry “flushed out.” Related Reading: How An ‘Inconsequential’ Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000 In a heated interview with Bezinga, Long was adamant about her controversial views of the crypto industry, stating that the industry had enormous potential but was being set back significantly by crypto firms operating using highly leveraged trading activities.  Long stated that she had an active discussion with a distinguished individual who shared her views and supported the notion that the majority of the industry needs to be purged for it to thrive. “I had a debate with a prominent person. I said, ‘Look, 90% of this industry still needs to go away, and he said it’s 99%, and I think that’s right. I mean whether it’s 90% or 99%, you see the point, there’s still a bunch of crap that needs to be flushed out,” Long said. Total market cap still holding above $1.03 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Long Compares Crypto Industry To 1999 Tech Stock Bubble Caitlin Long has likened the current crypto industry to the tech stock bubble in 1999. Notably, the tech stock bubble which coincided with the growth of internet adoption, rose 800% in investments, attracting investors from prominent companies all over the world. After reaching its peak, the stock market crashed by 740%, leaving the majority of investors and companies bankrupt and shut down.  Long compares this stock market crash to the crypto market crash in 2022 which saw Bitcoin falling by about 70% and major altcoins by 80% to 90%, resulting in the bankruptcy of major firms and investors.  She also stated that the crypto industry would not succeed if it continues to amplify trading activities through leverage while allowing unregulated exchanges to operate.  “It is in some ways a repeat of the tech stock bubble of 1999, just so much crap. And it will not succeed, and it needs to be flushed, but markets are flushing it,” Long stated.  Related Reading: Bankrupt FTX Exchange Turns Its Attention To Employees, Here’s How Much It Wants Long suggested that a lack of proper regulations on crypto exchanges is exacerbating the risks and challenges in the crypto space. Additionally, she revealed that she was in support of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent crackdown on crypto exchanges in the industry. Nevertheless, the CEO has not proposed a total annihilation of the crypto industry, just a major portion of it. When asked about her views on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Long stated, “I don&#8217;t really care about the price. It is the least interesting aspect of this technology. I’m more interested in it as a technology.” Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced little price movement this week and is up by only 0.25% in seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Following the announcement on Wednesday that federal interest rates will remain at their current level, the premier cryptocurrency showed the expected reaction, maintaining its price above $27,000.  However, over the last two days, Bitcoin has witnessed a slight price decline of 2%. As the most-priced blockchain asset now hovers around $26,500, crypto analyst Captain Faibik has predicted an incoming bullish run, which may see BTC close out 2023 with impressive gains.  Related Reading: Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Poised For 30% Gain Soon On Saturday, Captain Faibik shared on X (formerly Twitter) with his 65,000 followers a Bitcoin price forecast. Using data from Tradingview, the analyst stated that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a consolidation in a falling wedge stretching as far back as March 2023. According to Faibik, the asset is also likely to remain in this wedge all through October, reaching as low as $23,000. Upon testing this price level, Faibik predicts Bitcoin could experience a price breakout and embark on a strong bullish run. To explain, a falling wedge pattern is generally interpreted as a bullish signal. It usually suggests that a bearish trend is losing momentum, and a price reversal could soon occur.  If this pattern holds true in the present Bitcoin market, Captain Faibik predicts Bitcoin could start rising in November, attaining a price of $34,500 in January 2024. Such price gain would mark a 30% increase in Bitcoin’s current price.  As usual, there are no guarantees no this prediction as the crypto market is subject to various factors. Investors are advised to conduct proper personal research before making investment decisions.

The token’s daily trading volume is also down by 29.95% and is valued at $9.17 billion. With a market cap of $517.19 billion, Bitcoin retains its spot as the largest cryptocurrency in the market.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/october-important-sec-crypto/",
    "description": "As October approaches, the crypto community will have their eyes set on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as it has some key decisions to make that could invariably affect the crypto industry and everyone in it.  SEC Appeal Incoming? The SEC is expected to decide whether or not to appeal the ruling in its case against asset manager Grayscale, with the deadline for an appeal being October 13 (45 days from the court’s ruling).  On August 29, Grayscale secured a landmark victory against the SEC as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the regulator failed to provide a valid reason for denying Grayscale’s application and ordered that the SEC review the application once again.  Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty Following the decision, a spokesperson for the agency stated that they would review the decision before determining their next steps. If the SEC chooses to appeal, it can do so at the US Supreme Court by filing a petition for a &#8220;writ of certiorari,&#8221; which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case, or it can ask for an &#8220;en banc&#8221; review where all the judges of the DC Court of Appeals will further review the case.  An appeal by the SEC will undoubtedly dampen the mood in the crypto community as it could prolong the wait for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. However, suppose the Commission chooses not to appeal, it will become law that the spot and futures market are correlated, and the SEC’s argument that the spot market is more susceptible to fraud and manipulation will no longer stick.   Cryptocurrency market cap currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Pending ETF Applications The second deadline for several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications is in October. The SEC must decide (approve, deny, or delay) on these applications. Some notable dates include October 16 and 17. The former is the second deadline for a decision on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust.  Meanwhile, October 17 is the second deadline for the SEC to decide on the iShares Bitcoin Fund, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Wisdomtree Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. It is expected that the SEC will again choose to delay its decision on these applications, with the next deadline for a decision coming next year. Related Reading: ImmutableX Makes Noise As IMX Dominates Top 50 Roster With 33% Climb If the SEC continues to stretch its decision on these applications, the earliest a final response can come is on January 10, 2024, the final deadline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. There should, however, be some positives to take from October as the SEC is expected to allow the launch of the pending Ethereum futures ETF applications, with Volatility Shares projected to launch theirs on October 12 and others coming subsequently.  Featured image from Hotcore"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-network-fees-hit-2023-low-what-it-could-mean-for-eth-price/",
    "description": "In recent weeks, Ethereum (ETH), one of the most valuable assets in the cryptocurrency market, has not enjoyed favorable sentiment due to its struggling price and unstable on-chain performance. The general market condition has not offered much reprieve either, as most altcoins have failed to maintain an upward momentum.  Fortunately, the latest on-chain revelation offers some hope for the price of Ethereum.  Ethereum Average Fee Drops To Lowest Level In 2023 On-chain analytics have been helpful in providing real-time insights into crypto market trends. And the latest on-chain revelations have highlighted a plunge in Ethereum network fees, which might prove to be a turning point for the cryptocurrency’s market value and performance. According to the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have dropped to their lowest levels in 2023, with each transaction averaging about $1.15 as of this writing. This reflects a significant fall from the huge fees seen in 2021 and 2022, with demand for processing power causing the average fees to reach above $50. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price Historically, such a decline in fees is a positive sign for Ethereum’s utility and adoption, as lower costs make it more profitable and worthwhile to use the network. Santiment also noted that rising utility is often the case due to Ether tokens becoming more affordable to circulate. It is worth noting that the impact of this development can spread to the overall market value of the digital asset. Increased utility and adoption can contribute to the recovery of Ethereum’s market capitalization and value.  The Effect On ETH Price? Indeed, the plunging network fees positively benefit Ethereum and its users, especially as it can improve other network metrics and parameters. However, this development has not significantly impacted ETH price, as it seems to be struggling to break out from under the current selling pressure. On Thursday, September 21, the cryptocurrency fell beneath the psychological $1,600 level for the second time this month. And the Ether token continues to trade below this price mark, with a roughly 2.6% decline in the past three days. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Plunges After Rejection, Are Bears Back In Action? Investors will be watching to see if Ethereum can build positive network momentum while fees are low. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to propel the ETH price out of consolidation, especially as there are no signs of buying pressure from Ethereum whales. Moreover, the dwindling number of major ETH holders adds zero optimism to this scenario. This is because such a decline in whale holdings can make the Ethereum price increasingly susceptible to downward pressure. According to CoinGecko data, the Ether token trades for $1,593, reflecting a 2.6% price dip in the past week. Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $191.6 billion.

In recent weeks, the network has shifted its focus away from speculation, opting instead to double down on its commitment to technological advancement.  This move was evident in the multiple presentations it delivered, shedding light on its ongoing efforts and its ambitious goal of achieving 1,000 parachains.

This holistic approach to blockchain interoperability opens up vast opportunities for developers and users alike, promising seamless interactions between disparate blockchain ecosystems. Navigating Choppy Waters: DOT&#8217;s Price And Sentiment DOT price has been navigating choppy waters since February. As of the latest data, DOT is trading at $4.01, according to CoinGecko, with a 24-hour movement of 0.1% and a seven-day decrease of 4.3%. This downtrend has led many to wonder if DOT can regain its bullish momentum in a bearish market. DOT reached a market cap of around $5 billion, Saturday. Chart: TradingView.com On-chain data cited in a report suggests a glimmer of hope, indicating a slight improvement in DOT&#8217;s weighted sentiment over the last three weeks. This uptick in confidence among traders suggests that some believe in DOT&#8217;s potential for an eventual upswing, though it has yet to manifest in price action.  Related Reading: XRP Hurdle In The Run-Up To ‘Proper Party’ – Will Altcoin Price Slip?

Nevertheless, Polkadot&#8217;s recently unveiled plans and its unwavering commitment to technological innovation position it favorably for the long run. The network&#8217;s vision of a cross-chain future, with an expanding parachain ecosystem, could serve as a catalyst for renewed investor interest and a potential bullish reversal.
