The statement was <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/media-release/collective-engagement-implement-crypto-asset-reporting-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">published</a> on Nov. 10. </p><p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/oecd-releases-framework-to-combat-international-tax-evasion-using-digital-assets\">published the CARF</a> in 2022. Developed from an April 2021 mandate from the G20, the CARF framework requires <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reporting</a> on the type of cryptocurrency and digital asset transaction — whether through an intermediary or a service provider.</p><p>The statement’s authors intend to activate exchange agreements for information exchanges to commence by 2027. According to the text:</p><blockquote>“The widespread, consistent and timely implementation of the CARF will further improve our ability to ensure tax compliance and clamp down on tax evasion, which reduces public revenues and increases the burden on those who pay their taxes.”</blockquote><p>The list of pledging countries includes all 38 member states of the OECD and some traditional financial offshore havens such as the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories of the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar. However, being Europe-centered, it misses crucial markets such as China and Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Turkey. There is also not a single African country and only two Latin American ones — Chile and Brazil. </p><p><strong><em><u>Headline: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-losses-on-tax-returns-in-the-us-uk-canada\"><strong><em>How to manage crypto losses on tax returns in the US, UK and Canada</em></strong></a></p><p>CARF is not the only tax information exchange protocol that is being implemented on the international level to capture crypto income. In October, the eighth iteration of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8) — a cryptocurrency tax reporting rule — <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/council-of-europe-adopts-dac8-crypto-tax-reporting-rule\">was formally adopted</a> by the Council of the European Union.
