    "description": "Filecoin (FIL) continues to enjoy investors&#8217; interest following a 10.28% gain in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The altcoin has recently been the center of attention following a gradual price rise in the past week culminating in a 15.34% price gain. Interestingly, the spike in FIL’s price over the 24 hours appears to be fueled by exciting developments in the project’s ecosystem.

Launched in March 2020, Solana is regarded as one of the most prominent smart contract-compatible platforms offering fast transactions and almost non-existent fees. Solana&#8217;s integration with #Filecoin is a significant move away from centralized storage solutions and a remarkable step towards enhancing the reliability and scalability of the Solana blockchain.@solana is utilizing Filecoin to make its block history more accessible and usable… pic.twitter.com/1NcuaLNYT5 — Filecoin (@Filecoin) February 16, 2024 Ranked as the fifth-largest crypto project with a market cap value of $47.97 billion, Solana’s integration with Filecoin is aimed at migrating from its widely criticized centralized storage system to decentralized storage solutions, with the aim of improving its existing scalability and integrity.  Through this integration, Filecoin’s network will assist Solana in enhancing access to its blockchain history, which will be beneficial to developers, explorers, indexers, and other network users. In addition, Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions will allow Solana to experience data redundancy, scalability, and a higher level of security while operating as a decentralized network.  Interestingly, this development created much excitement in the Filecoin user community as FIL surged by over 10%, reaching a value of $6.36. Meanwhile, FIL’s daily trading volume stands at $497.78 million, having recorded an astounding 178.42% gain.

However, in the last few weeks, the token has experienced a steady price recovery which is further aided by its most recent boost in price. If the bulls are able to sustain the current buying momentum, FIL may hit the $8 price mark representing a return to the levels seen at the start of 2024. However, according to the token’s daily chart, the relative strength index has now crossed into the overbought zone. This indicates that there might be an incoming trend reversal. In that case, FIL’s price may fall as low as $4.90, which represents its next support level and a 23.71% decline from the current market price.  Filecoin (FIL) trading at $6.341 on the daily chart &#124; Source: FILUSDT chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from Filecoin, chart from TradingView"
