    "description": "Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has laid a bullish narrative for altcoins, predicting that these crypto tokens will make a significant run of theirs soon. This prediction is based on his belief that altcoins are still undervalued compared to the flagship crypto, Bitcoin.  Crypto Analyst Says Altcoins Are About To Explode Michaël van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “there is still around 40-60% market capitalization to gain for the altcoins.” In a subsequent X post, he noted that the valuations of these crypto tokens in their BTC pairs are still relatively low, and that suggests that “strength is still to come,” he claimed.  Related Reading: Dogecoin To $100? Crypto Analyst Reveals The Key The analyst believes that the valuation of these altcoins should be done using their “Bitcoin values” and no other way. If that is done, he remarked that one will be able to see that “most altcoins are still heavily undervalued compared” to the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, he hinted that altcoins will enjoy these significant gains once Bitcoin consolidates.  In a video posted on his YouTube Channel, Michaël van de Poppe elaborated on the correlation between Bitcoin and these altcoins. The analyst stated that Bitcoin hitting new highs means that there is more money in the market and that this money will rotate to other crypto tokens soon enough.  Once that happens, he expects these altcoins to make significant returns that might be underestimated because of the bear market stigma. Meanwhile, Michaël van de Poppe predicts that altcoin season will come in different rounds. The first one will see these crypto tokens coming close to their all-time high (ATH) or even breaking it, as seen with some already.  The Best Time To Have Bought Altcoins  Michaël van de Poppe had previously prepared his followers for this imminent altcoin season when he advised them on the right time to buy these crypto tokens. Back then, he mentioned that the best time to invest in altcoins was “6-10 months prior to the Bitcoin Halving.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees 2,000% Explosion In Adoption, Is SHIB Headed For A $0.0008 ATH? The analyst called that one correctly, seeing as altcoins have made significant runs since then alongside Bitcoin. AI and Meme coins, in particular, have led the way, with tokens like the foremost meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), seeing a significant increase in their market cap.  Despite the tremendous run these tokens have made so far, there still seems to be an opportunity for investors to position themselves, considering that Michaël van de Poppe mentioned that they are still undervalued.  DOGE price at $0.166 &#124; Source: DOGEUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from The Crypto Times, chart from Tradingview.com"
