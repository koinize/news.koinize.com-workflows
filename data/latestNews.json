    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/top-3-meme-coins-like-bonk/",
    "description": "Solana-based BONK has emerged as one of the best performers over the past week even after meme coins put on a good show for investors. However, given that the meme coin has since crossed the $1 billion market cap threshold, some will argue that the potential to make a lot of profit has diminished already, leading to a hunt for other meme coins that could end up putting on a similar rally. So here are the top 3 meme coins under a $50 million market cap that could see a lot of upside in the right conditions. Doge Killer (LEASH) Tops List Of High Potential Meme Coins The Doge Killer (LEASH) coin is the brainchild of the Shiba Inu team which made its name as the OG ‘Dogecoin killer’. As the Shiba Inu ecosystem expanded, so did the potential, and a number of tokens have since made their way out from the team, including BONE and LEASH. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price Will Rise 1700% To $11, Gives Reasons Why However, while Shiba Inu and BONE have since crossed the $200 million market cap mark, LEASH remains the lowest-rated SHIB ecosystem token in terms of market cap. Putting it in contrast with the performance of its predecessors, the LEASH token shows a lot of promise, especially in a bull market. It is one of the most popular meme coins still under a $50 million market cap, meaning that there could be at least a 10x increase expected from here. This makes LEASH a good opportunity for investors looking for smaller cap meme coins. Wojak (WOJAK) Meme Coin Rides PEPE Hype Wojak (WOJAK) was one of the many meme coins that made their way out of the woodwork following the PEPE pump earlier in the year. But unlike many others, WOJAK has persevered after securing multiple centralized exchange listings. Following the decline in the meme coin prices over the last few months, the WOJAK market cap fell drastically. Currently, it is sitting at a $23 million market cap, while PEPE’s market cap is still over $400 million. In the event of a PEPE rally, the chances of WOJAK making a run for it are high. So there could be a 10x opportunity with this coin.

The Myro meme coin previously rallied to a $50 million market cap. However, it has since corrected and is trading at just $35 million at the time of this writing. If the Solana ecosystem outperformance continues, Myro could follow in the footsteps of BONK as more money flows into the ecosystem. Reaching even a $400 million market cap would mean more than 10x its current price, making it a good meme coin to keep an eye on as the market develops.
