    "description": "Solana is attempting a recovery wave from the $80 zone. SOL price could struggle to clear the $92 and $94 resistance levels in the near term.

There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $85.00 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
