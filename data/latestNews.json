Most of its trades have been done via a web-based application. However, the team <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/unsiwap-launches-ios-mobile-wallet-in-select-countries\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/unsiwap-launches-ios-mobile-wallet-in-select-countries/amp\">launched a mobile app for iOS</a> on April 13. Prior to this date, the team had complained that Apple was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-wants-to-launch-mobile-wallet-but-apple-won-t-green-light-it-s-launch\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-wants-to-launch-mobile-wallet-but-apple-won-t-green-light-it-s-launch/amp\">holding up the app’s launch</a> in the Apple App Store. Even after getting the green light from the App Store, Uniswap still did not have a dedicated app for Android devices.</p><p>According to the Oct. 12 announcement, the new Android beta app allows users to select coins on different chains without switching networks. It automatically detects which network a coin is on and switches to that network without the user prompting it to. It can be used on Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and BNBChain currently, with more chain compatibility slated for the future.</p><p>The wallet also routes Ethereum transactions through a private pool in order to help avoid front-running and sandwich attacks, although this feature can be turned off if the user prefers. In addition, it automatically detects most coins that have built-in transfer fees. These fees are displayed in the interface, making the user aware of them.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-assistant-soon-incorporate-bard-ai-chat-service\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/google-assistant-soon-incorporate-bard-ai-chat-service/amp\"><strong>Google Assistant will soon incorporate Bard AI chat service</strong></a></p><p>The announcement linked to a signup for an email waitlist, which it stated will be used to roll out copies of the app to early adopters. The team also plans to release the app’s open-source code in the coming weeks, as part of its security audit with Trail of Bits.</p><p>Uniswap is not the only decentralized exchange to offer a mobile wallet.
