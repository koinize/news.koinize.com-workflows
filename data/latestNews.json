The executive noted that available capital and technology disruption have been attracting more companies and CEOs to invest in “things for the future,” like blockchain technology. Johnson said:</p><blockquote>“One is it allows a payment mechanism. Number two, it allows smart contracts to be programmed into the token. And three, because it’s a general ledger, it has a source of truth. So whoever has that token, all rights in that token are granted to that person.”</blockquote><p>Johnson used Rihanna as an example to illustrate her point of view. In February, the singer released one of its popular songs as a nonfungible token (NFT), allowing holders to partially earn royalties on streaming. “My favorite example is Rihanna,” she noted about the NFT collection launched just before the Super Bowl. </p><p>“I know she’s just testing the market in these 300 NFTs [...]. Well, why can she do that? She can do it because when Spotify plays a Rihanna song, it can capture the smart contract, execute and say: ‘I owe royalties here so nobody has to be involved in it.' And it can take the fractional payment and go to Frank, a big Rihanna fan.” </p><p>Athletes can also benefit from tokenization, according to Johnson:</p><p>“Think [about] athletes are going to sign a big contract. They’ll say to their fans 'I’m going to sell off tokens worth 10% of my future revenue stream. I’m going to sell 100,000 tokens and boom, the fans are probably going to pay a premium for it. So it will be a way and if you think about it, it’s just securitization done on steroids.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ The Future is Tokenized Culture<br><br>Franklin Templeton’s Jenny Johnson nails it at CNBC ‘Delivering Alpha’. <br><br>- Tokenization = Securitization on Steroids<br><br>- Tokenization of Cultural IP via NFT Royalty Streams. <br><br>Rhianna is creating modern era ‘Bowie Bonds’ for fans that can… <a href=\"https://t.co/Vrfqyne7SM\">pic.twitter.com/Vrfqyne7SM</a></p>&mdash; Ram Ahluwalia, higher for longer crypto CFA (@ramahluwalia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahluwalia/status/1708154160426758311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Johnson has been with Franklin Templeton for more than 30 years and currently sits at the top of the company’s executive leadership as president and CEO.
