The motive behind these transactions has triggered more speculation within the larger crypto community. One theory suggests a probable sell-off, given that these recent transfers have diminished the distressed crypto lender's wallet holdings to a mere $81.63 million worth of digital assets.</p><p>Significantly, these transactions occurred at a one-hour interval, as indicated by Etherscan records. The abrupt movement of these tokens has triggered discussions regarding a possible liquidation. However, certain sources assert that Voyager Digital is presently in the process of consolidating all tokens from various addresses into a primary address.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/74e74fc7-8731-4f5d-8ba9-47c7aa9f908e.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of the transfers from Voyager to Coinbase.  Source: Etherscan</em></figcaption></figure><p>The speculation of a sell-off gains additional support from Voyager Digital's ongoing trend of divesting its SHIB holdings since the start of this year. In February, the company <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/voyager-is-selling-crypto-assets-through-coinbase-suggests-on-chain-data\">executed transfers of nearly $10 million worth of digital assets</a> to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges within a single day.</p><p>The tokens moved include 270 billion SHIB, valued at $3.2 million, 4.9 million Voyager Tokens (VGX) with an estimated worth of $2.1 million, 3,050 ETH equating to $3 million and 221,000 Chainlink (LINK) amounting to approximately $1.5 million. It's important to highlight that these valuations corresponded to the tokens' market values during the time of the transfer.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/voyager-customers-targeted-by-scammers-during-30-day-withdrawal-period-report\"><strong><em>Voyager customers targeted by scammers during 30-day withdrawal period: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>Following Binance U.S.'s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-set-to-acquire-voyager-digital-assets-for-1b\">court-sanctioned acquisition of the lender's assets</a>, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1629700878235230208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> that Voyager liquidated digital holdings exceeding $56 million across three cryptocurrency exchanges.
