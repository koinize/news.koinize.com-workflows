    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/polygon-eyes-sidechain-upgrade-to-zkevm-validium-matic",
    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic has proposed a notable upgrade to the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) network. </p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">According to a forum post dated June 20, Bjelic suggested transforming the PoS network into a 'zkEVM validium' version, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to bolster security.</p>\nPolygon's Adoption of zkEVM and the Validium Model\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Polygon PoS, an Ethereum scaling solution established in 2019, currently manages over $900 million in total value locked within its contracts, processing over two million transactions each day. A second network, Polygon zkEVM, launched in March, utilizes zero-knowledge proof rollups to scale Ethereum.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">In Bjelic's proposal, the original PoS network would also be upgraded to a zkEVM, or zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, version. The principal difference with the recently launched network is that the new Polygon PoS would not function as a \"rollup\". Instead, it would operate as a \"validium\", storing only validation proofs on the layer 1, while keeping the actual transaction data on a separlate chain.</p>\nSecurity Enhancement and Lower Fees\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">This approach would allow the Polygon PoS to feature lower transaction fees than Polygon zkEVM, contributing to increased usage. Moreover, the upgrade could potentially improve the security of Polygon PoS by enabling it to inherit Ethereum&rsquo;s security.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">In the future, Polygon zkEVM might be deployed for high-value transactions where security is a top priority. Simultaneously, Polygon PoS could be the preferred network for gaming and social media enthusiasts requiring high transaction volume and lower transaction fees.</p>\nPolygon 2.0 and Data Availability\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The transformation of Polygon PoS and the launch of Polygon zkEVM form part of a grander plan by the team to create a &ldquo;Supernet&rdquo;. This ambitious project, also known as \"Polygon 2.0\", aims to unite various application-specific chains.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Zero-knowledge proofs are seen as a significant advancement in blockchain technology, and data availability will play a key role in unlocking their full potential.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">According to Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Polygon, future base-layer blockchain protocols will need to optimize data availability for proofs, verifications, and settlements rather than execution. Avail, a platform spun off from Polygon Labs and led by Arjun, offers infrastructure for ZK-rollups and other off-chain scaling solutions, addressing the current costs associated with submitting ZK-rollups and Optimistic Rollups to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Bjelic indicated that his informal proposal might evolve into a formal Polygon Improvement Proposal by November, with potential implementation on the mainnet between February and March 2024. If successful, this upgrade could represent a significant leap towards improving the security and performance of Polygon networks.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The proposal comes in days after another Polygon upgrade proposal detailed aspects of its governance towards what has been dubbed as an Ecosystem Council.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/sec-sues-binance-coinbase-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-inside-job/",
    "description": "While the cryptocurrency community is excited about the BlackRock Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing and the planned involvement of other prominent players in traditional finance, such as Fidelity and Deutsche Bank, one observer is skeptical. On Twitter, he notes that these Wall Street giants only became involved after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took legal action against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, a popular exchange in the United States and Western Europe. Is This An Inside Job? He claimed that the SEC could have colluded with specific players to provide them additional time to catch up. This statement has sparked considerable speculation within the industry. However, there is no evidence to suggest that government regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who have filed a lawsuit against Binance, have purposely targeted top cryptocurrency platforms in the United States to enable Wall Street firms to dominate the market. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees 55% Increase In New Daily Addresses As Bullish Sentiment Grows On June 5, the SEC sued Binance, alleging that the exchange was engaged in several illegal activities, including operating an unregistered securities exchange, failing to register as a broker-dealer, and misleading investors about its operations. They also claimed that some of the assets listed by the crypto trading platforms were unregistered securities. The SEC leveled 13 charges against Binance, Changpeng Zhao, the exchange’s CEO, and Binance.US. However, Binance has said it will defend itself against the lawsuit. While the lawsuit is pending in a federal court, the SEC dropped its request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Binance.US on June 17, 2023. It means Binance.US clients are free to access their funds while also showing that the SEC could, after all, be willing to work with cryptocurrency exchanges.  BlackRock Bitcoin Spot ETF Filing Good For Grayscale? Notably, the TRO was less than two days when BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, with over $9 trillion in assets under management, applied for a Bitcoin Spot ETF on June 19. Their decision to file effectively legitimizes Bitcoin as an investment asset. If approved by the SEC, it will provide an avenue for institutional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin.  Following BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF application, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) soared over 12%. At the same time, the discount, which is the difference between GBTC share price and net asset value (NAV) of Grayscale’s Bitcoin holdings, has been decreasing. After the discount fell to 44% on June 14, this value now stands at 36.6%, trackers on June 20 show. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Registers 11% Gains As Broader Market Suffers Volatility It remains to be seen whether the SEC will approve the first Bitcoin spot ETF in the country, following Canada, which approved the Purpose Bitcoin ETF in February 2021. In the meantime, Bitcoin prices are reaping higher, soaring 13% in 5 days. In that sense, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust discount could continue to decrease. This outcome might be the first positive development for the cryptocurrency and the nascent industry. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView"

    "description": "Bitcoin is again at 50% market dominance, indicating that the cryptocurrency now accounts for half of the total crypto market cap, valued at $1.052 Trillion. According to data from Tradingview, Bitcoin&#8217;s total market dominance crossed above 50% yesterday, June 19, for the first time in months.  The news of Bitcoin’s renewed dominance has driven much excitement across the crypto community, with many speculating on the reason for such market growth.  However, one possible reason is the news of prominent global asset manager BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move appeared to have boosted investors&#8217; confidence upon announcement, causing BTC&#8217;s price to surge above $28,000 since last month. According to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading around $27,432.93, with a 3.13% gain in the last day. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by 83.39%, valued at $17 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin currently boasts a staggering market cap of $531.54 billion, covering over 50% of the entire crypto market.  Bitcoin Market Dominance At 50.63% &#124; Source: Tradingview.com Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal BlackRock’s ETF Filling: An Influential Mainstream Move The news of BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF filing was seen as a major development in the crypto space drawing several reactions from crypto enthusiasts across the globe.  Essentially, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) mirrors the fluctuations in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, granting investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without requiring direct acquisition.  The foray of a traditional finance company such as BlackRock, with a valuation of $105.25 billion, into the realm of cryptocurrency carries immense significance. There is even a belief among some industry figures that this ETF application will be accepted in a &#8220;short time&#8221; despite the high number of ETF rejections usually dished out by the SEC. This will be the first-ever spot market Bitcoin ETF certified by the SEC if approved.  Related Reading: Why The Ripple General Counsel Demands Impartiality From SEC Staff The Promising Prospects of A Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin has experienced a significant amount of volatility since May 2021. The price of the number one cryptocurrency has fluctuated wildly, reaching an all-time high of over $68,000 before crashing to a low of $26,500.   A Bitcoin ETF would be good news for investors as it provides an easy, secure, and regulated way to invest in Bitcoin and diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, a Bitcoin ETF will likely attract more institutional investors who were previously hesitant about getting into crypto because of custody and regulatory concerns. The buzz surrounding the Bitcoin ETF continues to intensify, with additional news emerging that Fidelity Investments, an asset management powerhouse with assets totaling $4.5 trillion, is seeking a regulatory license to provide crypto custody services.
