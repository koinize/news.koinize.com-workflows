The wallet uses multiparty computation (MPC), which is used to break a user’s private keys into three smaller parts known as key shares. </p><blockquote>“Having the key shares split across three different locations mitigates the risk of the keys being compromised and reduces the vulnerability of the system.”</blockquote><p>Two of the three key shares will be controlled by the user at all times, allowing for self-custody. CZ added:</p><blockquote>“Binance’s Web3 Wallet lowers the barriers of entry for users to achieve full self-custody of their assets, and it is an important, convenient bridge towards DeFi empowerment. Ultimately, our priority is to ensure users can explore Web3 with us within a user-friendly and protected environment.”</blockquote><p>According to Richard Teng, head of regional markets at Binance, the MPC technology removes the fear of losing one’s seed phrase. “We want our users to be assured that they are interacting with Web3 within a secure and protected ecosystem. That is why we have incorporated MPC technology as well as Binance’s trusted security infrastructure within the Web3 Wallet,” he added.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-france-director-resigns-latest-departure-crypto-exchange\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-france-director-resigns-latest-departure-crypto-exchange/amp\"><strong><em>Binance France director resigns, adding to list of exits from crypto exchange</em></strong></a></p><p>Binance’s decision to delve into other crypto services comes at a time when its spot trading business appears to be struggling to retain investors.

According to the researchers:</p><blockquote>“Binance’s spot trading volume has seen a significant decline in the past year, perhaps due to its listing strategy.
