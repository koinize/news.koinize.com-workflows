    "description": "<p>For cryptocurrency traders, having constant access to account balances, open positions, and global market prices is absolutely essential. But being chained to a trading desk or computer simply isn't always desirable in today's fast-paced, mobile world. Thankfully, the award-winning PrimeXBT mobile app provides traders with everything they could possibly need to stay tightly connected to crypto markets, no matter where they are in the world.</p>\n<p>Whether lounging by the seaside on a tropical beach vacation, traversing new exotic lands as a digital nomad, or simply walking your dog around the neighborhood, you can react in real-time to sudden volatility spikes and efficiently manage existing trades in just a few taps. The PrimeXBT app puts a full suite of professional trading tools right to the palm of your hand.</p>\n<p></p>\nStay informed with real-time market data and pricing\n<p>The intuitive PrimeXBT interface grants easy access to over 100 diverse trading instruments across forex, commodities, stock indices, and of course, cryptocurrencies. The mobile app's customisable watchlist feature lets you easily track real-time pricing data across all major global markets.</p>\n<p>Scroll through and view up-to-the-second price action on popular forex pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. Check current gold and crude oil prices, alongside stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225. The app also provides live updated prices for all top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and many more.</p>\n<p>With constant access to global market prices right at your fingertips, you can capitalise on emerging short-term opportunities or adjust current open positions to mitigate your risk. The app ensures you have the latest market data, no matter where you are located in the world, at any given moment.</p>\n<p></p>\nExecute trades and complex strategies in a few taps\n<p>Acting decisively on a compelling potential trade is just as quick and seamless in the PrimeXBT mobile app. You can easily long or short Bitcoin and other popular digital assets with just a few taps. And use advanced mobile charting capabilities and technical indicators to help identify and confirm ideal entry and exit points.</p>\n<p>The app's robust trading features allow executing complex strategies like building long/short portfolios across diverse asset classes, to properly diversify and reduce risk. Or utilise leverage up to 200x on crypto trades, for significantly greater profit potential.</p>\n<p>Managing open positions across markets is equally simple and intuitive. The app clearly displays all current positions, their unrealised profit/loss in real-time, and allows you to quickly modify stop losses and take profit levels. You thus have full mobile control and can close positions to take profits or add margin to current trades when necessary.</p>\n<p></p>\nAccess unique features like Covesting Copy Trading\n<p>In addition to core trading capabilities, the PrimeXBT app also conveniently grants you access to unique proprietary features unavailable anywhere else. This includes the Covesting Copy Trading module, which lets you automatically mimic the trades of vetted professionals.</p>\n<p>You can browse detailed strategy manager profiles, showcasing transparent historical performance data. And pick a consistently profitable trader to copy based on metrics like all-time ROI percentage, win rate percentage, and five star rating. Any and all trades the manager executes will replicate in your account, allowing you to piggyback off their proven expertise.</p>\n<p>Copying the best crypto traders on the platform is an excellent way to diversify and grow your income streams. The mobile app makes it easy to find top trading talent and capitalise on their signals from anywhere around the globe.</p>\n<p></p>\nDeposit, withdraw, and manage your account on the go\n<p>The ability to securely deposit funds, withdraw profits, or access 24/7 multilingual customer support via live chat is an additional convenience. The app even recently added the ability to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin, and Tether stablecoins directly on your mobile device, making topping up your trading account easier than ever.</p>\n<p>Managing your fiat (USD and EUR), cryptocurrency, and stablecoin balances, and initiating transactions is simple and intuitive through the well-designed wallet interface. And should any issues arise, PrimeXBT&rsquo;s responsive global customer support team is available through the app day and night.</p>\nBuilt for today's active, on-the-go crypto traders\n<p>In today's busy world, serious traders need flexible access to react to markets whether they are relaxing at home, working in the office, or anywhere else in between. With the full-featured PrimeXBT mobile app, cryptocurrency traders finally have sophisticated trading tools right at their fingertips, no matter where life takes them.</p>\n<p>The platform's steady enhancements and intuitive user interface clearly showcase why PrimeXBT rightfully earned the prestigious Forex Award for Best Crypto Trading App. If you want reliable, worldwide access to global markets, from anywhere at any time, download the free PrimeXBT mobile app for iOS and Android devices today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

    "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Singapore-based Web 3 gaming firm Affyn is set to participate in the annual Grand Prix Season Singapore (GPSS), a 10-day event supported by the Singapore Tourism Board that culminates during the&nbsp; Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix weekend. According to the team statement, Affyn entered a strategic partnership with GPSS to present a metaverse event to the fans of the Grand Prix.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\"We are proud to partner with GPSS as it underlines Affyn&rsquo;s intent to bolster Government initiatives and bring Web 3.0 development to the next level,&rdquo; said Affyn CEO Lucaz Lee. &ldquo;As the only official Web 3.0 company partnering with GPSS, an event supported by STB, it is an incredible opportunity to drive awareness of developments in the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The event, titled &lsquo;Web 3.0 | Art Meets Metaverse&rsquo;,&nbsp; is set to run on Saturday, 16th September 2023, at Suntec City&rsquo;s Synthesis from 1 PM to 4 PM (local time). The event will include NFT exhibitions from artists around Singapore, a celebrity-hosted panel talk show and experiential zones that allow guests to delve into the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With Singapore rising as a crypto hub in the East, the involvement of crypto in such a global sporting event blends well in maintaining its verve as the leading crypto hub in Asia. The event aims to educate non-crypto fans on the developments of the metaverse in the art world, dive into discussions on the state of the metaverse industry, interact during the exhibition and learn from experts via their talk shows. In addition, attendees can interact and share with other enthusiasts and dive into how blockchain and the metaverse affect art in the real world today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In other news, Affyn-based gaming title Nexus World Land City will be launching its third wave of land parcels starting August 23.&nbsp; Players will have the chance to claim their land parcels in eight cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Manilla, Sydney, and Zurich.&nbsp;</p>\nCrypto companies&rsquo; relationship with F1 extends\n<p>Despite the recent departures of FTX and Tezos, who sponsored the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team and Scuderia AlphaTauri, respectively, crypto partnerships with F1 teams have grown, as evidenced by Affyn&rsquo;s Singapore GP event. Earlier this year, British F1 team Williams Racing entered a strategic partnership with Kraken Exchange to launch a competition to see NFTs showcased around this year's Singapore GP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other crypto partners in F1 include Bybit, sponsoring Redbull Racing Team in a $150 million deal and Stake.com, an Alfa Romeo Formula One Team sponsor.&nbsp;</p>"
