Despite the seemingly unconventional choice of the Guernsey regulator for its constitution, the fund‚Äôs listing on Euronext suggests a strategic maneuver, though its meager 1 million euro launch and unfamiliar management casts a shadow over its appeal.</p><p>Moving on, Pechman shifts focus to the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-2024\">United States Bitcoin ETF landscape</a>, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on approving a spot Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) ETF, setting a potential deadline for early 2024.
