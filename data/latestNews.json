Linea comprises 100+ protocols, developer tools, and decentralized applications (Dapps), making it a useful scalable tool for developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p><p>Symbiosis Finance broke into the mainstream with its stablecoin liquidity solution in March 2022. Since then the cross-chain liquidity provider has integrated several other layer-2 scalable solutions.</p><p>Earlier in April, the protocol <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/symbiosis-integrates-zksync-natural-evolution-of-scaling-solutions\">integrated zkSync, another zk rollup developed by Matter Labs</a>. The integration helped the protocol to provide one-click swaps from Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Telos and other blockchains to zkSync and back. Apart from zkSync, the cross–chain liquidity protocol has also added other popular L2 solutions, including Polygon’s zkEVM, Optimism, and Arbitrum since April.</p><p>Cointelegraph contacted Symbiosis co-founder Nick Avramov to get insight into the protocol’s tryst with L2 solutions, what made them choose Linea and how the solution stands in comparison to other L2s. Avramov told Cointelegraph that Linea perfectly aligns with the protocol’s strategy to support the most popular L2s and the decision to integrate it was based on the community feedback and requests from partners such as OpenOcean, OKX DEX and more, that are using Symbiosis SDK/API. </p><p>Talking about the rise of ZK rollups as a prominent L2 force, Avramov said:</p><blockquote>“zk roll-ups have better user onboarding capabilities as they are targeting new domains like Gamefi, Social etc. to engage more people without security sacrifice as most of these new domains rely on Ethereum + cost less.\"</blockquote><p>Zk solutions are a natural evolution of rollups, he said, adding \"I believe at some point Optimistic rollups will cease to exist.\"</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/consensys-zkevm-set-for-public-testnet-to-deliver-secure-settlements-on-ethereum\">ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum</a></em></strong></p><p>Avramov noted that zk rollups are the true L2 solutions and have the potential to resolve the cross-chain/multi-chain dilemma, an issue that was raised by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in January 2022.</p><p>Symbiosis said the integration of zk rollups has already helped it scale and increase its transaction throughput by 300% month on month with cross-chain trading volume soaring past $500 million. The liquidity provider believes with the integration of Linea, cross-chain swaps can surpass the billion dollars in volume in the coming couple of months.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-kuwait-bans-crypto-and-virtual-assets-transactions&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/defi-security-audits-bug-bounties-broken-heres-how-fix/\">Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here’s how to fix them</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "<p>ChainGPT Pad, the IDO platform that will be enabling the next generation of startups in the crypto, blockchain, and Web3 industry has just been released</p>\n<p>ChainGPT, the provider of AI-powered Infrastructure for the digital economy has just launched the ChainGPT Pad; a platform that connects promising early-stage startups with the $CGPT community and enables a new era of initial DEX offerings.</p>\n<p>Now projects of all calibers will have an environment to supercharge their social presence, bootstrap their communities, and bring their products to market with greater impact.</p>\n<p>What is the ChainGPT Pad?</p>\n<p>The ChainGPT Pad is an IDO platform and incubator for Web3 projects looking to bring their ideas to life and jumpstart their token ecosystems. As a means to uphold the standards of ChainGPT, the Pad conducts rigorous quality assurance tests and due diligence processes to vet incoming projects and is highly selective with who they allow to list.</p>\n<p>The launchpad is coupled with the ChainGPT incubation program that provides a network of expert mentors (founders, venture capitalists, and CEOs of other successful projects) that provide support to all projects that meet a certain qualification criteria.</p>\n<p>What are some of the Platform Features?</p>\n<p>The ChainGPT Pad has been geared up with all of the leading innovations that contribute to successful, healthy, and effective IDO launches. Striking the perfect balance between opportunity and security the ChainGPT Pad has been carefully designed by a team of professionals with experience working on some of the industry's leading launchpads.</p>\n<p>Two Round Structure&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every IDO is given two rounds for the audience to participate; starting at the guaranteed allocations for round 1 (where the upper tiers of the $CGPT community members are given exclusive access). In order to participate in the guaranteed allocation, qualifying members must register their interests (info on registration here). Moving into round 2, the FCFC (first-come-first-serve) invites members of all tiers and partners.&nbsp;</p>\nStaking &amp; Point System\n<p>Tithed to the $CGPT token ecosystem, the Chain GPT Pad has a simple and effective structure for establishing tiers. One $CGPT token is equal to one Point, point multipliers are based on the staking pool durations. An in-depth guide to the Staking and Point logic systems can be found here.</p>\nFair Tier System\n<p></p>\n<p>A model of prioritization and inclusion based on a balanced point module that leverages staking the $CGPT token to signal commitment. Composed of four distinct grade categories, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond, the tier system provides a structure for the discerning user that looks for maximal benefits. To explore the benefits of each tier and understand the detailed scope of inclusion, please refer to the official post here.</p>\nFlexible Refund Policy\n<p></p>\n<p>As a means to provide the highest possible grade of protection to the participants of ChainGPT Pad&rsquo;s IDOs, a refund policy has been implemented that allows users up to 14 days of post-round considerations to finalize their commitments and lock in their allocations. More information about the refund policy can be found here.</p>\n<p>For questions pertaining to how projects can register, how users can join, restrictions of countries, requirements to signal interest, and everything in between ChainGPT has provided a dedicated F.A.Q. for the Pad which can be accessed here.</p>\nUpcoming IDOs on ChainGPT Pad\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Immediately upon launch, ChainGPT orchestrated a world-class lineup of three startups that have been going through the incubation program and have prepared to launch their IDOs in the months of July-August.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-crucial-retest-which-historical-patterns-repeat/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows a Bitcoin indicator is near a crucial retest currently that may decide where the cryptocurrency will go next from here. Which Pattern Will Bitcoin Follow Next: 2016 Or 2019? As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC SOPR for short-term holders is approaching the baseline. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling/moving their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the market is realizing some amount of profit with their selling currently. On the other hand, values below this threshold suggest loss taking is the dominant force in the market at the moment. Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to the 1 baseline implies the total amount of profits being realized are exactly canceling out the amount of losses as the market as a whole is neutral. This SOPR is for the entire Bitcoin market, but in the context of the current discussion, the relevant version of the metric is the one for just a single segment of the market: the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs). The STH group includes all the investors who purchased their coins less than 155 days ago. This cohort generally includes the weak hands of the market, who may easily react to fluctuations in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 90-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the last few years: Looks like both the metrics have been above the baseline in recent days: Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 90-day MA of the Bitcoin STH SOPR (colored in yellow) broke out above the 1 baseline back when this rally first started around the beginning of the year. This breakout suggested a shift towards profit selling for these investors, something that has historically been observed in all previous major rallies in the cryptocurrency. With the latest leg in the Bitcoin rally above the $30,000 mark, the 365-day MA of the indicator (highlighted in blue) has also managed to climb up above this mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spikes, Is This Bearish? While this has been happening, though, the 90-day MA has actually been heading down and is now about to cross below the 365-day MA as it approaches the 1 baseline. In the chart, the quant has marked the two previous instances where a trend similar to this had formed for the asset. It looks like back in 2016 when the 90-day MA had retested the 1 mark after a similar structure had taken shape, the metric had found support at the break-even mark. This rebound kept Bitcoin going and the coin eventually built up into a bull market. In 2019, though, the retest of the 90-day MA STH SOPR failed and a bearish trend once again took over the coin. It wouldn&#8217;t be until 160 days later that bullish sentiment returned and the rally happened. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains As the current Bitcoin market looks to be in a similar spot as these two historical occurrences, it&#8217;s possible that it may follow the lead of one of these. It now remains to be seen, as to which of these patterns the asset might exhibit this time. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,300, down 1% in the last week.
