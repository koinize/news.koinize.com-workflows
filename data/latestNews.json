    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/michael-saylor-bitcoin-1-million/",
    "description": "Microstrategy’s Executive Chairman and Co-founder, Michael Saylor, is one who always uses every opportunity to heap praises on the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Once again, he didn’t disappoint, as BTC was the center of discussion in his latest media appearance.  Bitcoin Going To $1 Million In an interview with CNBC, Michael Saylor stated that Bitcoin is going to $1 million if it isn’t going to “zero.” He noted that the “big question” in relation to BTC&#8217;s potential was whether or not the digital asset was legitimate. According to him, if Bitcoin is a “legitimate institutional asset,” then everybody is “under-allocated” to it.  Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When His comment about Bitcoin possibly hitting $1 million seems to stem from his belief that Bitcoin as an asset is still untapped, as he expects many institutional players to get in on the crypto token. He noted how 99.9% of the world’s capital is currently tied to other global assets like bonds, real estate, stocks, and precious metals. However, expects that to change soon enough. That change, he believes, will stem from education about digital assets. From that, Saylor says more and more people will realize that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to digital assets. Interestingly, he labeled BTC as a “digital transformation of capital,” alluding to its disruptive nature.  These institutional players could well be allocating more of their capital to BTC as early as 2024. The new rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently opened the door for firms to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on their balance sheet. As such, we could see other tech firms adopt Microstrategy’s “Bitcoin Strategy.” BTC price reclaims $43,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Is Going Foward In 2024 Saylor also discussed several macro factors that he considers bullish for Bitcoin going into the new year. These factors include the potential approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, the loosening of monetary policies, and wider BTC adoption in countries suffering from inflation.  Related Reading: Changelly Releases Updated Predictions For XRP Price, When Will It Cross $10? He also alluded to the BTC Halving event, which he believes is also bullish for the Bitcoin ecosystem. All these factors form a “confluence of very bullish milestones,” which Saylor projects are going to happen over the next six months.   Saylor will undoubtedly be fulfilled when his company’s Bitcoin strategy has panned out as Microstarategy is currently in profit with its Bitcoin acquisitions. The company’s stocks are also flying high as it recently hit a 2-year high, thanks in part to its BTC exposure. At the time of writing, BTC is currently trading at around $43,000, up over 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com"
