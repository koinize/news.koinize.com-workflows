    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-diverge-away-from-price-speculation/",
    "description": "In a recent analysis, crypto analyst &#8220;Flip The Chain&#8221; highlighted insights from Michele Worthington, a project manager and designer for San Francisco&#8217;s properties and luxury homes. Worthington&#8217;s comments, primarily focused on XRP, present a detailed view of the digital currency&#8217;s future beyond mere market speculation. XRP Set To Break Free From Speculative Pricing Worthington&#8217;s analysis begins with a clear distinction: “While XRP&#8217;s pricing is currently driven by speculation, akin to many other tokens including Bitcoin, it&#8217;s poised for a significant shift. As the financial payments sector, historically slow in adopting digital technologies, progresses, XRP&#8217;s pricing mechanism will diverge from these speculative trends.” According to her, this change will make XRP immune to traditional market fluctuations, crypto-related events like the Bitcoin halving events, or “sporadic” news cycles. She outlines XRP&#8217;s unique advantages for banking and financial institutions. “XRP stands out for its ability to execute bank payments in mere seconds at a fraction of the cost. To illustrate, a cross-border transfer of $50M can be done for as little as 30 cents. Such efficiency is pivotal in the financial sector.” Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook: Expert Forecasts Potential Rise To $5.5 The integration of XRP with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is highlighted by Worthington as a key factor for its future trajectory. She notes, “The synchronization of international compliances and regulations is crucial for CBDCs to effectively integrate with XRP. This has been the focus of numerous pilot tests and partnerships, leading to the adoption of the ISO20022 standard. The standard is set to debut on November 19, with a transition period until late 2025.” 2024: A Pivotal Year For Ripple She also draws attention to Ripple&#8217;s strategic preparations for this shift. Ripple has formed a network of global alliances, including in “Japan, Australia, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Africa, Switzerland, Dubai, UAE, BRICS as well as with the BIS, IMF and more.” According to her, this sets the stage for 2024 as a pivotal year. Once the banking sector integrates with XRP, the influence of retail investors on its price will become negligible,” claims Worthington: When the banks plug in, the small retail investor won’t make a dent in the price. Each XRP has to be a very high value to move a large part of the $7 trillion daily on the FX market worldwide. Moreover, Worthington also highlights XRP’s potential in the tokenization of diverse assets, such as bonds and real estate, underscoring its non-exclusivity but significant role in handling substantial volumes, making the XRP token even more valuable. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2450% XRP Price Surge Following Bullish Crossover On liquidity solutions, Worthington states, “XRP’s testing with over 30 central banks showcases its ability to alleviate liquidity challenges, particularly in transactions involving less liquid currencies.” She concludes, “The role of XRP in currency transportation is unparalleled, especially in terms of scalability, interoperability, and liquidity. Its emergence as a revolutionary element in the financial sector is not just probable but imminent. [&#8230;] XRP transports the currency. No other token can do this on this scale of interoperability with this kind of liquidity. It&#8217;s revolutionary.” It&#8217;s important to note that the views and predictions shared by Michele Worthington represent her individual perspective on XRP&#8217;s future. As with any analysis, her insights should be considered as part of a wider range of expert opinions and not as definitive forecasts. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6536.
