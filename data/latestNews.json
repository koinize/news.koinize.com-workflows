Solana&#8217;s Resilience Shines Amidst Market Volatility, Regulatory Challenges Solana has emerged as one of the gainers in a mixed early trading session among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The rally comes as a breath of fresh air after a series of bearish indicators that surfaced last week, including the closure of the Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol, Cardinal, citing &#8220;macroeconomic challenges.&#8221; Hey Everyone, we have some unfortunate news to share üôÅ After a lot of reflection, we‚Äôve decided to begin the process of winding down our protocols. Let&#8217;s dive into it üßµ ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚Äî Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) June 28, 2023 Additionally, the Revolut neobank and crypto exchange reportedly announced the delisting of Solana, Cardano, and Polygon for its US-based users last Wednesday. This news comes on the heels of the recent lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against leading exchanges Coinbase and Binance.US, wherein Solana, Cardano, and Polygon were named as tokens allegedly involved in the illegal issuance of financial securities. Despite these regulatory hurdles and market setbacks, Solana has displayed resilience and managed to remain on a positive trajectory amidst the volatility.
