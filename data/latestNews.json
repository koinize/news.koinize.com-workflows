Ethereum is still struggling to gain pace for a move above $1,850. The price is trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $1,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend its decline if it fails to stay above the $1,740 support. Ethereum Price Remains In Range Ethereum failed to continue higher above the $1,850 level and started a downside correction. ETH corrected lower below $1,800, but the bulls remained active near $1,750. A low was formed near $1,741 and the price is now making a fresh attempt to gain pace, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $1,780 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,866 swing high to the $1,741 low.
