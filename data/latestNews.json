None of the reports have mentioned any cryptocurrency being stolen by their suspected assailants either. </p><p>Not to mention, three of the deaths arent even being treated as potential homicide.</p><p>At the same time, one could also argue that the rise in reported deaths is simply a result of more mainstream coverage of crypto.  </p><p>The number of crypto deaths reported by mainstream media went from less than one a year to at least 10 since November 2022, when the crypto industry witnessed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. </p><p>Data <a href=\"https://www.vuelio.com/uk/blog/how-has-the-ftx-collapse-impacted-media-attitudes-towards-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >compiled</a> by public relations firm Vuelio shows that the total number of crypto stories pushed by traditional media outlets surged after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Frieds crypto exchange, sometimes even beating out the number of stories written by crypto media outlets. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FTX-related-articles-by-international-national-news-and-business-finance-publications-1024x818.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-23757\" width=\"765\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FTX-related-articles-by-international-national-news-and-business-finance-publications-1024x818.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FTX-related-articles-by-international-national-news-and-business-finance-publications-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FTX-related-articles-by-international-national-news-and-business-finance-publications-770x615.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FTX-related-articles-by-international-national-news-and-business-finance-publications.jpg 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px\" /></figure><p>It stands to reason that news desks have become more aware of cryptocurrencies over the past year.
