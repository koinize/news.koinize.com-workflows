    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xmr/what-is-monero-xmr-network/",
    "description": "[toc] What Is Monero (XMR)? Monero (XMR) is one of the leading cryptocurrencies focused on privacy, zero knowledge, and censorship-resistant transactions.  The Monero network operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, like Bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies. This system incentivizes miners to contribute blocks to the blockchain. Monero&#8217;s PoW algorithm is designed to resist specialized mining equipment known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These ASICs confer a significant advantage to companies and affluent individuals, potentially leading to the centralization of the network. In 2018, Monero became the first major cryptocurrency to deploy what is known as “bulletproofs”, a technology that greatly improved the efficiency of XMR transactions and led to at least an 80% drop in the size of the average transaction and dramatically reduced fees for the end-user. Related Reading: What Is Kaspa (KAS) Blockchain? Monero underwent an upgrade in 2019, transitioning to the RandomX algorithm. This algorithm is tailored to accommodate both CPU miners (such as laptops) and GPU miners (utilizing standalone graphics cards). Theoretically, this adjustment should foster greater decentralization within the Monero network. Who Are The Founders Of Monero (XMR)Network? Monero (formerly known as Bitmonero) traces its roots back to 2014, when it forked from the Bytecoin blockchain. Its development has been steered by a vibrant community of developers, including Ricardo Spagni (aka Fluffypony), who played a pivotal role in shaping Monero&#8217;s trajectory. The commitment to open-source principles and community-driven governance underscores Monero&#8217;s success.  Since its launch, Monero has undergone significant enhancements, including database structure migration, implementation of RingCT for transaction amount privacy, and setting minimum ring signature sizes to ensure all transactions are private by default. These improvements have bolstered the network&#8217;s security, privacy, and usability. Related Reading: WHAT IS XRP LEDGER (XRP)?

This commitment to privacy empowers individuals to transact freely and securely without fear of surveillance or censorship and serves as a shield against oppression in regions where financial freedom is restricted. Monero has had around 32 million XMR transactions, with approximately 8.6 million in 2022, a slight drop from its peak in 2021. In comparison, Bitcoin recorded nearly 800 million transactions during the same timeframe. Monero&#8217;s privacy features have legitimate applications in safeguarding sensitive financial information, protecting personal liberties, and preserving economic freedom. How Does Monero (XMR) Work? Monero&#8217;s core privacy features are its utilization of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT. Unlike transparent blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero prioritizes user confidentiality, offering a level of anonymity comparable to physical cash transactions. Despite its acclaim within the cryptocurrency community, Monero hasn&#8217;t been immune to regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory bodies have raised concerns about the potential misuse of privacy coins, leading to restrictions on their trading and listing on certain exchanges. However, Monero remains steadfast in its commitment to privacy, offering users a secure and private means of transacting in the digital realm. Monero&#8217;s mining mechanism sets it apart from its peers, emphasizing inclusivity and accessibility. The RandomX algorithm, optimized for general-purpose CPUs, democratizes the mining process, allowing a diverse range of hardware to participate.
