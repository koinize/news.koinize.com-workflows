Some analysts are predicting that a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-bitcoin-resistance-to-retesting-25-k-support-is-futile\">drop to $25,000</a> is inevitable based on the current state of BTC derivatives data. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/2113de8e-773f-4a3f-9c73-323173391a8f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cryptocurrency market performance, 1-day chart: Coin360</em></figcaption></figure><p>The muted crypto price action and lack of a bullish response to today’s rate hike pause could be the lingering effect of the SEC’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\">charges against Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-lawsuit-binance-coinbase-crypto-industry-comments\">Coinbase exchange</a>. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/coldie-snoop-dogg-piece-vitalik-buterin-john-mcafee/\"><strong><em>‘Holy shit, I’ve seen that!’ — Coldie’s Snoop Dogg, Vitalik and McAfee NFTs</em></strong></a></p><h2>FOMC tanks crypto and some equities</h2><p>The stock market dropped sharply on June 14 after the FOMC decision with the Dow dropping 200 points minutes after the announcement. Another major equity index, the S&amp;P 500 hit a 13-month high. </p><p>While Powell decided to pause interest rate hikes, the Federal Reserve reiterated the focus to bring down elevated inflation. </p><p>In the policy issuance, the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230614a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">stated</a>,</p><blockquote>“In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”</blockquote><p>The wording shows a potential return to interest rate hikes in the future. To date, crypto prices are still highly correlated with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 and most major banks still expect the U.S. to experience a sharp recession at some point in 2023. This has not stopped major stock indices from reaching yearly highs after the United States <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/31k-was-not-the-end-5-things-to-know-in-bitcoin-this-week\">debt ceiling deal</a>. </p><p>According to U.S. Bank analysis which incorporates more than 1,000 data points, investor sentiment about the current state of the economy remains low.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/d0c63524-07e7-43dd-8c7d-ae2d814ace85.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Global economic health.

While the EU unveiled a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-s-new-crypto-law-how-mica-can-make-europe-a-digital-asset-hub\">digital asset framework</a>, MiCA, the United States seems intent to regulate through SEC enforcement. </p><p>On June 5 and June 6, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil lawsuits against two of the largest centralized exchanges in crypto, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\">Coinbase</a>. The SEC claims that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-labels-61-cryptocurrencies-securities-after-binance-suit\">61 different cryptocurrencies</a>, representing $100 billion in value, are securities.</p><p>One of the 61 crypto tokens listed was Algorand (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/algorand-algo-price-index\">ALGO</a>), a token that in 2019, Gensler called a “<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/video-of-sec-chair-praising-algorand-resurfaces-after-recently-deeming-it-a-security\">great technology</a>” which seems to contradict this latest enforcement action. </p><p>Other top crypto tokens specifically mentioned as securities include Binance USD (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-usd-busd-price-index\">BUSD</a>), Binance Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>), Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>), Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>), Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>), Filecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/filecoin-fil-price-index\">FIL</a>), Cosmos (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index\">ATOM</a>), The Sandbox (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/the-sandbox-sand-price-index\">SAND</a>), Decentraland (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/decentraland-mana-price-index\">MANA</a>), Axie Infinity (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/axie-infinity-axs-price-index\">AXS</a>) and COTI. </p><p>The recent SEC action adds to a long history of disputes, misconceptions or mistrust over the actual use case of digital assets. After the FTX implosion, some feel <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-poked-the-bear-and-the-bear-is-pissed-o-leary-on-the-crypto-crackdown\">U.S. lawmakers</a> are angry with the crypto industry. The most recent battle is centered on how <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-explained\">centralized exchanges</a> can use customer funds.</p><p>Not all lawmakers are comfortable with Gensler’s actions. United States Rep. Warren Davidson (OH) introduced the “<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-us-lawmakers-file-sec-stabilization-act-to-fire-gary-gensler\">SEC Stabilization Act</a>” into the House of Representatives on June 12. The bill would remove Gensler as Chair and redistribute power amongst a committee. </p><h2>TVL and volume remain low</h2><p>The attack on centralized exchanges has also increased Bitcoin exchange inflow and outflow. Exchange inflows indicate increased sell-side pressure while outflows are typical to self-custody assets.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/a5bcd73f-f098-4c40-8a38-9546ecd3dcb7.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin exchange net transfer volume.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-holds-26000-why-this-level-could-define-its-fate/",
    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) remains steady at $26,000 amidst ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency industry. While some investors are concerned about the impact of regulatory changes on the market, others see signs of a new bull run on the horizon. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Records Positive Moves As Majority Of Coins Bleed Why Is $26k A Critical Level For BTC? According to crypto analyst Crypto Con, Bitcoin&#8217;s resistance at the 2nd Line on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) at $31,000, followed by its support at the same level, echoes a pattern in 2016. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin could be on the cusp of a new bull run that will surpass previous highs. Crypto Con recently commented on the significance of these trends. &#8220;Reaching the mid-top line is an inevitability, just like all the cycles that have come before,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;Bitcoin has proven its resilience time and time again, and I believe that we are about to witness a new phase of growth in the cryptocurrency market.&#8221; That being said, Crypto Con&#8217;s analysis is based on historical trends and patterns, which suggest that Bitcoin could be in a favorable position for growth. On the same note, Cryptocurrency trader CJ recently shared his analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements on Twitter, breaking down the key levels to watch. On the weekly chart, CJ notes that Bitcoin has closed below its 200 Moving Average (MA) for the first time in 12 weeks. The price has dipped into a former range, but a close back above this level would be a positive sign. If Bitcoin can reclaim its June open of $27,000, CJ sees the potential for the price to reach $33,000. On the daily chart, CJ points out that the previous week&#8217;s high and low remain untapped, as does the daily demand level just below the range high. CJ sees a potential long opportunity if the previous week&#8217;s low is swept into the daily demand level and then reclaimed and a short opportunity if the previous week&#8217;s high is swept into the June open and then closes back below. Furthermore, on an intraday/1-hour basis, CJ suggests keeping an eye on the mid-point of the weekly range, which is currently capping the price to the upside. Another potential trade opportunity will arise if the local range low is swept and then reclaimed, with a target of the local range high. Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady, Bitcoin Remains Stable The Federal Reserve has announced that it will not increase interest rates this month, and it is unlikely that there will be any rate cuts in 2023. The Fed&#8217;s goal remains a 2% inflation rate, and it has signaled the possibility of rate increases later this year.  Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? The Fed has also indicated that it expects two rate hikes, each with a .25bps increase, by the end of the year, which is generally considered a hawkish statement. Despite these developments, Bitcoin has remained relatively stable, unable to move significantly in either direction. This is likely due to several factors, including ongoing regulatory uncertainty.
