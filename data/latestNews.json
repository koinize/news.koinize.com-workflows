However, the surge in price is not the only aspect fueling the enthusiasm surrounding XRP, as recent network activity has reached unprecedented levels.

The last time such a substantial increase in activity occurred was back in March, which resulted in a staggering price rally of over 45%. ðŸ˜® #XRPNetwork has now had its 2nd &#38; 3rd largest address activity spikes of all time these past 2 days.

This alignment of positive market factors has created a fertile ground for XRP&#8217;s price rally to flourish.
