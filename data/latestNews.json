Due to the immutable nature of data inscribed on-chain, these credits can be securely sold or traded with total transparency for all interested parties.</p><p>This allows government organizations, such as the UAE’s MCCE, to sell or issue credits to businesses. Credit holders can either spend the credits — which allows them to emit a specific amount of carbon over a given period of time — or sell and trade them to other organizations looking to offset their own emissions. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kenya-partners-with-abu-dhabi-s-venom-foundation-to-build-blockchain-web3-hub\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/kenya-partners-with-abu-dhabi-s-venom-foundation-to-build-blockchain-web3-hub/amp\"><strong><em>Kenya partners with Abu Dhabi's Venom Foundation to build blockchain, Web3 hub</em></strong></a></p><p>UAE leaders recently <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/breaking-down-details-uaes-climate-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> changes to the country’s agenda concerning climate change and carbon offsetting.
