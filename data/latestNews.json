According to him, YFI's open interest in dYdX spiked from $0.8 million to $67 million in a matter of days as a result of the actions of one individual. The same individual, according to Juliano, attempted to attack the SUSHI market on dYdX a few weeks earlier. </p><p>\"We did take action to increase initial margin ratios for $YFI prior to the price crash, but this was ultimately not sufficient. The actor was able to withdraw a good amount of $USDC from dYdX right before the price crash,\" he wrote. </p><p>On X, the exchange’s team said that \"highly profitable trading strategies have now been banned on dYdX,” in a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> reference</a> to the language <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mango-markets-exploiter-behind-alleged-116m-theft-will-stand-trial-in-december\">used by Mango Markets’ exploiter</a> Avraham Eisenberg in his $116 million attack of 2022. </p><p>dYdX is now offering a bounty payment in exchange for valuable information:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">dYdX will pay bounties to those most helpful in aiding the investigation<br><br>We will not pay bounties to, or negotiate with the attacker<br><br>We and others have made significant progress into identifying the attacker.
