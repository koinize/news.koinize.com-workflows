The firm told Cointelegraph on Sept. 28 that it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/valkyrie-exposure-ether-futures-etf\">planned to allow investors</a> exposure to Ether and Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) under a combined Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF, with purchases planned ahead of a launch the first week of October.</p><p>‘[T]he Fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts,” said the SEC filing.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The plot thickens, Valkyrie just put out 497 that they are in fact not going to buy Ether futures until they are live (prob Tue) and are going to sell the Eth futures they bought (in an effort to jump line a bit). SEC must have threatened them to cut it out.

It’s unclear what may have led the firm to the change in position in less than 24 hours. Valkyrie filed with the SEC for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-valkyrie-files-for-ether-futures-etf-with-the-sec\">listing an Ether futures ETF</a> on the Nasdaq Stock Market in August, but the regulator has not reached a decision on a proposed rule change allowing the investment vehicle.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vaneck-launch-ethereum-futures-etf-ads-ahead-sec-approval\"><strong><em>Enter the Ether: VanEck releases two ETF ads ahead of possible Monday launch</em></strong></a></p><p>Several ETFs offering exposure to Ether futures are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-futures-etfs-launch-next-week-government-shutdown\">expected to begin trading</a> the first week of October, including ones from VanEck, Bitwise and ProShares. However, on Sept. 28 the SEC <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-spot-bitcoin-etfs-blackrock-bitwise-valkyrie-invesco\">delayed its decision</a> on a proposal for a spot BTC ETF from Valkyrie, as well as proposals from BlackRock, Invesco and Bitwise. </p><p>The delays came weeks ahead of scheduled ETF deadlines for the SEC, with many suggesting the regulator was acting in response to a potential shutdown of the U.S. government. Members of Congress have until Sept. 30 to present a bill funding the government into the next fiscal year for U.S. President Joe Biden to sign into law.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
