That company has allegedly provided Paper Bird and its subsidiary FTX Trading directors and officers (D&O) insurance. The suit was filed by Bankman-Fried as an individual.</p><p>The suit claimed that Continental Casualty is the provider of Paper Bird’s “second-layer excess policy in the D&O  insurance tower.” D&O insurance protects the directors and officers of a company from personal losses in the event of a suit against them. Such coverage can be organized into a metaphorical tower of policies, where a policy on a given layer comes into force when the policy below it reaches its limit. </p><p>According to the suit, the primary layer of D&O coverage provided $10 million for Bankman-Fried's defense from two insurers, and Continental Casualty’s policy was intended to provide $5 million. The policy mandated that payments be made on a current basis. It covered the cost of defense against criminal charges, even though there was an exclusion for “fraudulent, criminal, and similar acts.” There was no clawback provision in the policy.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-for-legal-defense-using-previously-gifted-funds-from-alameda-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-for-legal-defense-using-previously-gifted-funds-from-alameda-report/amp\">Sam Bankman-Fried is paying for legal defense using previously gifted funds from Alameda: Report</a></em></strong></p><p>The suit <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67849260/1/bankman-fried-v-continental-casualty-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noted</a> that Paper Bird’s two primary D&O policy providers, Beazley and QBE, paid his defense costs according to the terms of the policy.
