According to a June 15 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da31d2d6-e547-43b0-821d-a235097ef9c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >report</a> from The Financial Times, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is pressuring major financial institutions to accept crypto clients. But it’s not just regulators laying down a red carpet to boost the special administrative region’s (SAR’s) Web3 industry. In one instance, Johnny Ng Kit-Chong, Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Johnny_nkc/status/1667499286047891456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >wrote</a> on June 10:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“There have been a lot of news about international virtual asset exchanges in the past two days. I send forth an invitation to welcome global virtual asset exchanges, including @coinbase, to come to Hong Kong, apply for a compliant exchange, and negotiate a listing plan. I am willing to provide assistance!”</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, Joseph Chan Ho Lim, Hong Kong’s Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, revealed in an <a href=\"https://cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/5835524730/15bd30a7a02001gyrh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >interview</a> that The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has conducted public consultations on the launch of stablecoins and is in the process of establishing a regulatory framework by the end of the year.  “Hong Kong will continue to support the development of the industry in the future and welcomes the industry and talents to come to the SAR,” the politician said. <br></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"The Hong Kong Web 3.0 Festival gallery hall (Twitter)\" class=\"wp-image-18400\" width=\"682\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi-770x578.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ftl3r5OaUAI1Jxi.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Hong Kong Web 3.0 Festival gallery hall (Twitter)</figcaption></figure><p>On Jun. 1, Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/yuan-stablecoin-team-arrested-wechats-new-bitcoin-prices-hk-crypto-rules-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >issued regulations</a> stipulating the requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges to apply for a license to operate in Hong Kong.

The move is reportedly the first act of a Chinese financial institution tokenizing a security in Hong Kong. The notes are governed by both Hong Kong and Swiss law as per their origination by the Swiss investment bank UBS. Ying Wang, deputy CEO at BOCI, commented: </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Working together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products. We are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong’s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation.”</p></blockquote><p>Previously, UBS had issued a $50 million tokenized fixed-rate note in Dec. 2022. Meanwhile, the government of Hong Kong issued an 800 million Hong Kong dollar ($100 million) tokenized green bond on Feb. 16, 2023, underwritten by four banks and priced with a yield of 4.05% per annum. </p><h2 id=\"h-do-kwon-in-and-out-of-jail\">Do Kwon: In and out of jail</h2><p>On June 15, The High Court of Montenegro in Podgorica <a href=\"https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/kralj-kriptovaluta-pritvor-crna-gora/32460870.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >ordered</a> Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon and CFO Han Chang Joon back to jail pending extradition proceedings to South Korea for charges relating to their role in the $40 billion collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem. <br><br>Earlier this month, Kwon and Joon were <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/binance-humilated-on-china-tv-hong-kong-100k-crypto-workers-chinese-ai-unicorn-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >released on 400,000 euros bail each</a> in their ongoing passport fraud case after a Montenegrin Basic Court dismissed an appeal by prosecutors.</p><p>Their brief period out on bail was not a happy time either. During their respite from prison, South Korean prosecutors announced they would apply to freeze Kwon and associates’ $13 million held in Swiss bank accounts.

When will the thundering of the black box of centralized crypto entities end?” the former blockchain executive asked, while also expressing his doubts on whether the industry will witness a “slump” or be “ushered into a new bull market” after such issues are resolved. </p><p>Last year, Huobi co-founders Jun Du and Leon Li reportedly sold 100% of their stake in the exchange to an entity controlled by Chinese blockchain personality and Tron founder Justin Sun.
