The Citibank report read:</p><blockquote>“Recent crossborder multi-bank experiments are now providing detailed insights into how central bank funding can be operationalized in a digital context, both internally and across entire markets.”</blockquote><p>However, over the next years, some of the major roadblocks to widespread adoption of digital assets include regulatory uncertainties, limited knowledge, backward compatibility with traditional financial systems and blockchain interoperabilities, among others, as listed below. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/49b7f2c3-148a-43c2-9f4d-132533b8c728.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Top impediment to the widespread use of digital assets in the next three years.

Therefore any created material cannot be considered literary or intellectually protected. </p><p>The proposal also ensures that credit, rights and compensation cannot be affected by material produced by generative AI. While companies can use generative AI-created scripts as source material, any writer who re-works the script will be compensated as if they are the original author. </p><p>Additionally, any studio or production company seeking a writer's help in the development of an AI-produced script must disclose the origin of the script.</p><p>Originally, the proposal was released eleven days prior on Aug. 11, but without significant information about important issues raised by the striking parties. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/u-s-judge-denies-copyright-for-ai-art\"><strong><em>US judge rules in favor of human ingenuity, denies copyright for AI art</em></strong></a></p><p>Along with updates to AI-related matters, the proposal touches on data transparency issues, which prior to the proposal writers rarely had access to metrics produced by their work. </p><p>The updated offer would allow viewership data to be made available to writers and presented in quarterly confidential reports. However, for the time being, it would only include Subscription Video On Demand (SVOD) metrics and not advertising or transactional videos. </p><p>The AMPTP proposal suggested that: </p><blockquote>“This increased transparency will enable the WGA to develop proposals to restructure the current SVOD residual regime in the future.”</blockquote><p>The latest updates took place on the 114th day of the strike and were the latest iterations of AI incorporation from Hollywood studios. </p><p>On May 3, they rejected requests from the Writers Guild of America (WGA) to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hollywood-studios-reject-banning-ai-from-writer-s-rooms\">ban AI completely</a> from the writing room.</p><p>There were also proposals that suggested <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-proposal-sparks-conflict-hollywood-sag-aftra-goes-strike\">background performers should undergo scanning</a>, receive compensation for the initial day of work and then grant companies ownership of the scan, image and likeness. This sparked a wave of backlash from entertainers in the industry. </p><p>Nonetheless, the signals of big production companies looking to incorporate AI are apparent. On July 27, Netflix posted AI job positions with exuberant salaries reaching up to $900,000. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-human-digital-souls-agi-alignment-problem-replika/\"><strong><em>Experts want to give AI human ‘souls’ so they don’t kill us all</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
