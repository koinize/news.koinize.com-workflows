Could Bitcoin’s weakness trigger further selling in altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin broke and closed above the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,228) on Sep. 14, indicating that the downside momentum is weakening.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/c9f13e7b-be3e-4e41-a41d-3fa40c418906.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Such a move will suggest that higher levels are being sold into. That could result in a retest of the strong support at $24,800.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) plunged below the $1,550 support on Sep. 11 but the bears could not build upon this strength. This suggests solid buying at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/35c78a32-f07b-4454-888a-d5b887d5741b.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. A break and close above the 20-day EMA could trap several aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. That could propel the price to $1,745.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears remain in command. The sellers will then make another attempt to sink the ETH/USDT pair below $1,550 and resume the downtrend.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) bounced off the psychological support near $200 on Sep. 12, indicating that the bulls are active at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/a575e7fb-e7be-4a16-89bf-37b57e46ac87.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart.

If the BNB/USDT pair turns lower from the current level, it will indicate that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on relief rallies. That will increase the risk of a breakdown below $200. </p><p>Contrarily, the RSI is forming a positive divergence, indicating that the selling pressure could be reducing. A rise above the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a retest of the 50-day SMA ($225).</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) has been trading between $0.41 and $0.56 for the past several days.

That could increase the risk of a drop to $0.22.</p><p>Contrarily, if buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal the start of a stronger recovery to $0.28. </p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) continues to trade between the 20-day EMA ($0.06) and the solid support at $0.06. This tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and a breakout may happen soon.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/3eee8fb6-4e0e-40c3-94c3-ead3d20d5f32.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart.

If this support breaks down, the DOGE/USDT pair may plummet to $0.055.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) has been swinging between $14 and $27.12 for the past several months. The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($19.51) where the bears are likely to pose a stiff challenge.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/41e31ecf-3037-4dd3-a13a-e5a67d0514d1.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart.

This level may again act as a strong hurdle but if bulls overcome it, the pair could climb to $27.12.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that demand dries up at higher levels. The bears will then try to resume the downtrend and yank the price to the vital support at $14.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-allows-start-ups-raise-funds-crypto-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/japan-allows-start-ups-raise-funds-crypto-report/amp\"><strong><em>Japan to allow startups to raise funds by issuing crypto instead of stocks: Report</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) snapped back from the 20-day EMA ($1.75) on Sep. 12, indicating that the bulls are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/6e623123-ea35-4980-bc36-53291934bfb9.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart.

This is an important level for the bears to defend because a break above it could propel the pair to $2.40. On the downside, a slide below the 20-day EMA could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) has been trading below the breakdown level of $4.22 for the past few days, which is a negative sign.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/667345fa-9ce3-4506-a2ef-e67713b40ebc.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart.
