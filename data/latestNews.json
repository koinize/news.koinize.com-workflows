The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hinman-docs-unsealed-sec-concerned-over-ether-not-security-statement\">unveiled documents offer valuable insights</a> into a significant speech delivered in 2018 by Bill Hinman, the former director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) corporation finance division. </p><p>In this 2018 speech, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-hinman-docs-worth-the-wait\">Hinman shared his perspective</a> that Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), one of the largest cryptocurrencies, should not be categorized as a security. The Hinman documents consist of internal communications within the SEC, providing a comprehensive view of the agency’s discussions and considerations leading up to and following Hinman’s speech. </p><p>In light of the recent release of the documents, Cointelegraph reached out to John Deaton, a crypto lawyer and founder of CryptoLaw, to shed some light on the significance of the documents. </p><p>In the interview, Deaton emphasized that the documents provide support for Ripple, Coinbase and other entities that have faced what he perceives as unjust targeting by regulators. Deaton suggested that these documents may not only influence public opinion but also potentially shape legislative discussions in Congress, as they raise concerns about the conduct of regulators and the interpretation of existing laws. </p><p>In his words: “The documents are what I expected in two ways. One, it helps Ripple, Coinbase, and others being unfairly targeted by regulators playing fast and loose with the law they took an oath to uphold. How much it helps in the courtroom is yet to be seen, but it certainly helps in the court of public opinion and in the halls of Congress. Two, it highlights the massive conflicts of interests and gross appearances of impropriety by William Hinman and Jay Clayton.”  </p><p>Clayton, an American attorney, previously served as the chairman of the SEC from May 4, 2017 until Dec. 23, 2020.</p><p>Regarding the specific impact on the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, Deaton noted that “the documents themselves don’t impact the judge’s underlying analysis of whether XRP was offered/sold by Ripple as an investment contract, or XRP’s status in the secondary markets in the United States.\" However, they do strengthen Ripple’s argument that the speech delivered by Hinman caused market confusion and hindered market participants’ ability to understand what was prohibited under existing regulations. He shared: </p><blockquote>“The documents do assist Ripple (and others) in arguing that the speech caused greater confusion in the markets causing market participants to lack adequate notice of what was prohibited by existing law.” </blockquote><p>Deaton further highlighted the potential consequences of the documents for Ether and ERC-20 tokens. He suggested that the documents may bolster Ether's position by reducing the likelihood of it being classified as a security by the SEC. He explained:</p><blockquote>“I think the speech documents are good for Ethereum ever being called a security by the SEC. It also could help ERC-20 tokens like Dragonchain because those tokens are governed by the Ethereum blockchain and if the SEC claimed the network was sufficiently decentralized then those tokens have even a better fair notice argument than Ripple.”</blockquote><p>In response to the overall implications of the documents, Deaton expressed his belief that they underscore the need for Congress to intervene and provide clarity in governing digital assets. He suggested that the SEC may not be the appropriate agency to oversee the crypto industry, given the apparent conflicts of interest and impropriety highlighted by the documents. He shared:</p><blockquote>“I think the documents advance the call for Congress to step in and provide clarity and that the SEC is the wrong agency to govern digital assets.”</blockquote><p>Finally, Deaton called for an inspector general investigation into why Hinman insisted on delivering the speech despite warnings from the SEC’s Office of the General Counsel and the director of trading markets. Deaton pointed out that Hinman referred to the speech as the “Ether Speech,\" further raising questions about potential biases and motivations. He noted: </p><blockquote>“I think the documents are a call for an IG investigation into why the speech was insisted on by William Hinman. The Office of General Counsel warned against giving Ether a pass and the director of trading markets specifically said the speech would lead to ‘greater confusion in the market.' But Hinman was determined to give it. In his email he called the speech itself the ‘Ether Speech.'</blockquote><p>Deaton isn't the only professional who believes there should be an investigation. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, echoed similar sentiments on his Twitter account. He called for an investigation to understand “what or who influenced Hinman, why conflicts (or, at the very least, appearances of conflicts) were ignored, and why the SEC touted the speech knowing that it would create 'greater confusion.'”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">13/An investigation must be conducted to understand what or who influenced Hinman, why conflicts (or, at the very least, appearances of conflicts) were ignored, and why the SEC touted the speech knowing that it would create “greater confusion.”</p>&mdash; Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601239536390144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-files-final-submission-against-sec-as-landmark-case-nears-end\">Ripple files final submission against SEC as landmark case nears end</a></strong></em></p><p>The release of these documents has sparked discussions about the role of regulators, the clarity of existing laws and the need for oversight in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/binance-ceo-controversial-move-selling-bitcoin-to-save-bnb/",
    "description": "The ongoing crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the crypto industry has taken a toll on one of the largest exchanges in the market, Binance.  The SEC recently filed a lawsuit against Binance.US, which has resulted in a significant decline in the value of Binance Coin (BNB). BNB has dropped more than 23% in the last week alone, currently trading at $238. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks Binance CEO&#8217;s Bitcoin Sell-Off As reported by NewsBTC, BNB is facing a potentially catastrophic situation after an exploit on the Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s Binance Bridge. The exploit could liquidate $200 million on Venus Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) if the BNB price drops to $220. Given these developments, reports now suggest that Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zao, sell spot Bitcoin (BTC) to prevent BNB from falling to $220. This move has been taken to defend against the liquidation of BNB at this key level, but it also capped the upside potential of Bitcoin. The practice of selling spot Bitcoin to purchase BNB is known as a &#8220;liquidation waterfall,&#8221; it is a common tactic used by exchanges to protect their users from significant losses. As spot Bitcoin is sold off, BNB is purchased, which helps to defend the $220 liquidation level. However, this also puts a cap on the upside potential of Bitcoin as the selling pressure on Bitcoin increases. According to the crypto trader “JW”, Binance and CZ have been selling spot Bitcoin at an alarming rate to support BNB, as seen in the chart above, which has resulted in the decline of Bitcoin&#8217;s value. While this move may help defend against the liquidation of BNB, it can potentially negatively impact the wider cryptocurrency market. In addition, despite positive economic news from the US, Bitcoin is struggling to break through its newly formed resistance at $26,400 and is currently trading at $25,800. The US Consumer Price Index indicates that the country&#8217;s inflation is slowing down, creating a more “relaxed” economic environment.  However, concerns over regulatory crackdowns and alleged selling pressure from Binance and its CEO are mounting, resulting in selling pressure preventing the largest cryptocurrency from continuing its bullish trend. Bitcoin Analyst Anticipates Drop To $24,000 According to cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe, Bitcoin is currently facing a crucial resistance level at $26,400 and has been unable to break through it. As a result, Van de Poppe expects the markets to drop into the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled for tomorrow.  Van de Poppe&#8217;s analysis suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s price may experience some downward pressure in the short term. However, he also sees this as an opportunity for traders to buy into the market at a lower price point.  Related Reading: Crypto Frenzy: Whale Accumulates 1.5 Trillion SHIB, Sparking Surge In Price The area around $24,500-$25,000 is a significant support level, and if Bitcoin&#8217;s price drops to this mark, it could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors.
