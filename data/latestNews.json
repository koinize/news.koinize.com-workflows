Here’s how BTC options traders can capitalize on the 45 day funding deadline. </p>\n                    <p><p>Bitcoin’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) price bull run towards $28,000 on Oct. 1 was partially fueled by the uncertainty regarding the United States debt limit. However, the U.S. President Joe Biden signed the spending bill just hours before the Sept. 30 deadline, avoiding a government shutdown. </p><p>Investors now question if the momentum remains favorable for cryptocurrencies given that the worst-case political-economic scenario is no longer on the table. However, it is worth noting that this bill merely provides extra funding for the next 45 days, giving more time for the House and Senate to work on their funding plans for 2024.</p><p>At first glance, it might be tempting for investors to use futures contracts to go long on Bitcoin. However, there's a significant risk of getting liquidated if the price suddenly drops, and it's impossible to predict whether a successful budget discussion down the road will benefit cryptocurrencies.</p><p>With the current extension in place, now, lawmakers need to find a solution before Nov. 17. According to Margaret Spellings, the President and CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center: </p><blockquote>\"We can't continue postponing our fiscal health and negotiating on the brink of government shutdowns and debt defaults.\"</blockquote><p>There's no doubt that, despite narrowly avoiding a crisis, the overall risk of an economic recession remains. The U.S. Federal Reserve is grappling with persistent inflation and rising energy prices, factors that have driven the S&P 500 to its lowest point in 110 days and pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to levels not seen since October 2007.</p><p>Additionally, oil prices have surged to $90, marking a 27.5% gain in just three months. This upward pressure on inflation is expected to further constrain economic activity. </p><p>On Sept. 27, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/27/feds-kashkari-isnt-sure-that-rates-are-high-enough-to-stop-inflation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-amp=\"https://www-cnbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/09/27/feds-kashkari-isnt-sure-that-rates-are-high-enough-to-stop-inflation.html\">expressed</a> uncertainty about whether interest rates have been raised sufficiently to combat this price growth.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s initial reaction does not guarantee a bullish momentum</h2><p>Amid all this turmoil, Bitcoin has increased in value, breaking through the $28,000 resistance on Oct. 2. This performance prompted investors to anticipate heightened volatility for the cryptocurrency as the upcoming debt ceiling decision approaches.</p><p>Professional traders will avoid directional risk given the uncertain outcome of the political debate and opt for the reverse (short) iron butterfly, a limited-risk, limited-profit trading strategy. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/2e830c9a-6aa3-4f3e-8b40-8dbc32bff29b.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Profit/Loss estimate. Source: Deribit Position Builder</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices mentioned were accurate as of Oct. 2, with Bitcoin trading at $28,326. All options listed expire on Oct. 27, but this strategy can also be adapted for different time frames. It's essential to remember that options have a set expiry date, meaning that the price increase must occur during the defined period.</p><p>The recommended neutral-market strategy involves selling 5.4 contracts of $26,000 put options while simultaneously selling 5.4 call options with a $30,000 strike. To complete the trade, one should buy 5.8 contracts of $28,000 call options and an additional 5 contracts of the $28,000 put options.</p><p>While a call option grants the buyer the right to acquire an asset, the contract seller assumes a potential negative exposure. To fully shield against market fluctuations, an investor must deposit 0.253 BTC (approximately $7,170), representing the maximum potential loss.</p><h2>Conviction in volatility is essential, as the risk-reward is reversed</h2><p>For this investor to profit, Bitcoin's price must be below $26,630 on Oct. 27 (a decrease of 6%) or above $29,280 (an increase of 3.4%). In essence, the trade offers a potentially substantial profit zone, but losses are 90% higher than potential gains if Bitcoin remains stagnant.</p><p>The maximum payout is 0.133 BTC (roughly $3,770). However, if a trader believes that volatility is imminent, a 6% movement within 24 days appears achievable.</p><p>It's important to note that investors have the option to reverse the operation before the options expire, preferably after a substantial Bitcoin price movement. To do this, they should repurchase the two options they had initially sold and sell the two options they had originally bought.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-investors-beware-425-billion-tokens-on-the-move-is-it-a-sell-out/",
    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth a staggering $3.2 million have made their way onto Coinbase, according to recent data on Etherscan. This substantial transaction, involving a jaw-dropping 425 billion SHIB tokens, has raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community.  The timing of this move couldn&#8217;t be more intriguing, as Shiba Inu has been experiencing a rollercoaster ride alongside the broader crypto market. Shiba Inu&#8217;s recent price action has been nothing short of dramatic. It surged in tandem with other cryptocurrencies but is now confronting significant resistance. The pivotal 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) level stands as a crucial test for the token&#8217;s short-term trajectory.  Related Reading: Crypto Era Looms: BIS Innovations Chief Calls On Central Banks To Prepare Should SHIB fail to break through this resistance, a potential trend reversal could be on the horizon, possibly catalyzed by large-scale sell-offs, much like the mammoth transaction to Coinbase. Although $3.2 million might not be a tidal wave in SHIB&#8217;s liquidity pool, it does invite some intriguing queries about the grand designs of prominent SHIB holders. Could this financial maneuver be a harbinger of a broader pattern in the making? It&#8217;s entirely conceivable that these crypto behemoths are seizing the opportunity presented by recent profits, especially given SHIB&#8217;s impending clash with a pivotal resistance threshold. This transaction could serve as an early indicator of a more extensive trend in the SHIB community. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and major holders often wield considerable influence. Thus, when they make a move of this magnitude, it can trigger a domino effect, influencing other traders and shaping market sentiment. Moreover, the timing of this transaction is noteworthy. SHIB is approaching a critical resistance level, a juncture where its price could either break through to new highs or face a substantial pullback. SHIB&#8217;s Current State And Burn Program As of now, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000730, as per CoinGecko data, reflecting a 3.8% decline in the past 24 hours. Over the course of the last seven days, SHIB has managed to eke out a marginal gain of 0.1%. These price fluctuations highlight the volatility that has become synonymous with meme tokens like SHIB. Interestingly, amid these price swings, the Shiba Inu burn rate has returned to the green zone. Nearly 95 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last 24 hours, underscoring the unwavering commitment of the SHIB community to the burn program. This program aims to reduce the substantial circulating supply, which has often been blamed for the token&#8217;s lackluster price performance. SHIB market cap currently at $4.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com According to a price report, the total number of SHIB tokens obliterated now stands at 410 trillion. This impressive feat has brought the total supply down from 999 trillion to 589 trillion SHIB. Currently, approximately 10 billion SHIB tokens are locked in staking contracts, leaving the circulating supply at around 580 trillion. Shiba Inu: Potential Price Impact The recent influx of SHIB tokens onto Coinbase and the ongoing burn program&#8217;s success are sure to keep investors and crypto enthusiasts on the edge of their seats. The question of whether SHIB can surmount its resistance and sustain its rally remains unanswered.  Related Reading: Solana Outperforms 2 Top Altcoins – Its Ripple Effect On Prices As the crypto market continues to evolve, SHIB&#8217;s fate may well depend on the interplay between its passionate community, whale movements, and market sentiment.
