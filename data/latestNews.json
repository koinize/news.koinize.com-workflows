As co-founder Simge Sandal explained, GainForest uses blockchain to autonomously direct funding to different projects in the global south using “measure-to-earn” technology, which focuses on measuring biodiversity data.</p><p>“Our core business is to create incentives that make environmental protection attractive for the local communities and also financially beneficial for them,” Sandal explained.</p><p>Private stakeholders can pledge money to indigenous communities and forest conservation projects through GainForest’s smart contracts. The platform automatically unlocks donations to communities responsible for maintaining ecosystems when monitored milestones are achieved.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/c4298cea-fd21-43f9-97b6-65db914821e0.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Satellite imagery, complemented by field data gathered by community members in Uganda, gives investors and donors a transparent view of ecological initiatives. Source: GainForest</em></figcaption></figure><p>This monitoring is carried out by locals on the ground using devices like smartphones and drones to provide images and other rich data of the environment.</p><p>A key characteristic that has made blockchain technology key to GainForest’s service is transparency. Sandal believes this is core to a regenerative economy, whether it’s monitoring the side effects of externalities or the growth of its net effects:</p><blockquote>“From the beginning to the end, we can provide this transparency and have an economy where everyone can see what’s happening and make better decisions.”</blockquote><p>An element of trust also comes into the equation when trying to onboard users and community members to make use of the technology to both benefit the environment and make a living from their efforts.</p><p>“Some of the communities, when we start working with them, are literally sitting there looking at this, and they’re like, ‘What do you want? Just go away.’ It takes some time to break the ice,” she added.</p><p>Cointelegraph will explore the GainForest project at length in an upcoming feature, but the project stands out as an innovative initiative harnessing nascent technology and hardware.</p><p>James Bettauer, co-founder and CEO of ecoToken, outlines how their Solana-based platform allows users to retire environmental credits directly on Solana and receive impact certificates as well as fungible credits.</p><p>Bettauer explained that the existing carbon credit system is “top-down,” with a large barrier to entry to be able to generate these types of credits.</p><p>“Blockchain enables a bottom-up approach where you can empower the actual project developer to create credits and add new revenue streams because to create a credit class in the existing system is over $1 million,” Bettauer explained.</p><p>As a result, smaller-scale projects and companies face significant hurdles to accessing credits online. For the ecoToken CEO, blockchain technology enables a “ton of new applications” and ways to develop consumer demand that presently don’t exist.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/dce2055e-b55a-4429-940a-db7011191231.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ecoToken co-founder and CEO James Bettauer, GainForest co-founder Simge Sandal, Sunrise Stake founder Daniel Kelleher and Cointelegraph journalist Gareth Jenkinson at Solana Breakpoint 2023</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Daniel Kelleher is the founder of Sunrise Stake, a decentralized finance protocol built on Solana that allows users to stake SOL (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) to receive green SOL (gSOL). These staking yields can then be donated toward climate impact programs to “passively offset carbon emissions.”</p><p>“We route some of our staking yield to different projects to ensure that we have a spread of climate impact, from offsetting carbon through projects like Toucan as well as ecoToken,” Kelleher explained.</p><p>The Sunrise Stake founder also believes that blockchain technology empowers regenerative economies, which inherently have net positive effects for communities, economies and the environment:</p><blockquote>“Why is it a powerful tool for creating regenerative economies? Because we have this power of smart contracts. We have this power of programmable money. You can build the rules for an economy right down at the code level, at the protocol level.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Magazine:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/slumdog-billionaire-incredible-rags-riches-tale-polygon-sandeep-nailwal/\"><strong><em>Slumdog billionaire: Incredible rags-to-riches tale of Polygon’s Sandeep Nailwal</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Binance Coin (BNB) has experienced a notable resurgence in the last few weeks, sparking a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market. With its versatile applications and growing popularity, BNB has captured the attention of influential investors, leading to a surge in on-chain activities that have stirred the digital asset community. The latest developments surrounding BNB reveal intriguing movements within the crypto space, particularly with the recent actions of a prominent whale investor.  Related Reading: Defensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023 Whale&#8217;s Strategic BNB Acquisition And Deployment According to a recent report shared by Lookonchain, a significant whale recently acquired a substantial amount of BNB, totaling 22,319 coins valued at a staggering $5.6 million. In an unexpected move, the whale swiftly withdrew the acquired BNB from the Binance exchange over the course of the last three days. Rather than holding the assets, the whale strategically injected these tokens into liquidity pools on both Biswap and PancakeSwap, aiming to generate additional revenue through trading fees. The #BinanceBlockchainWeek is coming soon! The price of $BNB has increased by 10% in the past week. A whale withdrew 22,319 $BNB($5.6M) from #Binance in the past 3 days and provided liquidity on #Biswap and #PancakeSwap to earn trading fees.https://t.co/dQTc7OUNp2 pic.twitter.com/GIzxVT9mvF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 6, 2023 The implications of this large-scale BNB movement have been manifold, triggering notable fluctuations in the coin&#8217;s price and market positioning. At the time of reporting, BNB is trading at $245, experiencing a minor dip of 2.2% in the last 24 hours. However, this dip comes amidst a significant seven-day rise of nearly 10%, indicating the ongoing dynamic nature of BNB&#8217;s value within the market.  While these fluctuations are not uncommon within the volatile crypto sphere, the recent whale activity has certainly played a pivotal role in shaping BNB&#8217;s current trajectory. Related Reading: Analyzing ADA Solid 25% Gain: Signs Point To Cardano Rally Ahead BNB market cap currently at $37.414 billion on the 24-hour chart at TradingView.com Market Impact: BNB&#8217;s Price Volatility The significance of the whale&#8217;s strategic investment and subsequent actions on Biswap and PancakeSwap cannot be understated. By adding a substantial amount of BNB to the liquidity pools, the whale has effectively contributed to the overall liquidity and trading volume of these platforms, potentially enhancing the overall ecosystem for BNB and other associated tokens.  This move not only demonstrates the growing confidence in BNB&#8217;s potential but also highlights the increasingly diverse strategies that influential investors are employing within the cryptocurrency landscape. BNB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Amidst these developments, BNB recently faced a temporary setback as XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, briefly surpassed BNB in terms of market capitalization, relegating BNB to the fifth position. However, the setback proved to be short-lived as Binance Coin swiftly reclaimed its fourth spot from XRP, underscoring its resilience and enduring appeal within the competitive cryptocurrency market. With growing investor interest and strategic maneuvers shaping its trajectory, BNB&#8217;s chart in the coming months is poised to be a compelling narrative within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.
