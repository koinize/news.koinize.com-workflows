    "description": "Several on-chain metrtics demonstrate the growing optimism about Cardano (ADA). Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has managed to break through a significant resistance level against the backdrop of a bullish market attitude. Not only is Cardano seeing a boost in momentum, but top altcoins are also feeling the effects. Strong positions held by Bitcoin and Ethereum above $40,000 and $2,200, respectively, add to the overall favorable market dynamics. Related Reading: ORDI Rockets To Unprecedented Peaks Alongside Bitcoin’s $42,000 Breakthrough Cardano Network Transactions Rise Cardano has been steadily rising, and expert cryptocurrency trader Ali Martinez pointed out that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s consolidation in the middle of November resembled that of the 2018–2022 phase. This suggests that Cardano may overcome the $0.45 resistance and reach $0.75 by the end of December. Cardano has had a pivotal three months, and what&#8217;s to come could be even more so. This is due to the fact that the network has seen numerous transactions totaling more over $100,000. Martinez claims that the spike in transactions indicates a rise in institutional interest in ADA. #Cardano &#124; In the last three months, there&#8217;s been a significant increase in $ADA transactions over $100,000, reaching new highs consistently. This surge points to growing interest in #ADA from institutional players and whales, which is usually a precursor to price spikes. pic.twitter.com/APczM2PGxM — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2023 Meanwhile, there&#8217;s another interesting development happening of late. According to the most recent data, once Bitcoin broke above the $41,000 mark, there was a bullish rebound that saw the percentage of lucrative Cardano addresses rise to a two-year high of 42%, or roughly 1.76 million addresses. Source: IntoTheBlock Based on IntoTheBlock&#8217;s examination, this increase in profitability not only represents a transient spike but also highlights ADA&#8217;s long-term potential. This encouraging development contributes to the general sentiment among investors by fostering a sense of assurance and faith in cryptocurrencies. ADAUSD currently trading at $0.399 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Whales&#8217; Influence On ADA&#8217;s Price And Sentiment And speaking of sentiment, Martinez emphasized the possible influence on the price of ADA while pointing out that whales have also been participating in the recent large-scale transactions on the Cardano network. The expert noted that actions such as these might be essential to a significant rise in the price of ADA.

Another explanation for Cardano&#8217;s high transaction growth could be this. The remarkable production of 9.1 million native tokens demonstrates the wide range of customization possibilities on Cardano. A further demonstration of the versatile utility of Cardano&#8217;s asset generation capabilities is the establishment of 81,447 token policies. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.399, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours, and down 7.1% in the last seven weeks, data by Coingecko shows.
