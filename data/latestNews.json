    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/rarity-cuts-ties-with-opensea-over-royalty-issue",
    "description": "\n                        <p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT marketplace Rarity has recently defended creator royalties and cut ties with OpenSea, LooksRare, and other platforms that do not enforce royalties.&nbsp;</p>\nRarity Takes a Stand\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a bold move that underscores its commitment to artist royalties, NFT marketplace Rarity announced its decision to sever ties with OpenSea, LooksRare, and X2Y2, effective September 30. This decision is a staunch defense of creator rights amidst an ongoing debate about NFT royalties.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rarity, known as a prominent NFT marketplace and aggregator, has been unwavering in its support for artist royalties. The platform's recent announcement clarified its stance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The statement declared,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"By September 30th, Rarible.com will no longer aggregate orders from OpenSea, LooksRare or X2Y2&hellip;We support royalties. We always have. And we always will.&rdquo;</p>\n\nRedefining Paradigms In Web3 Era\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In its public statement, Rarity commended the potential of Web3, emphasizing its promise for artists and creators. Beyond mining NFTs, the platform envisions a redefinition of how creativity is valued and compensated. According to Rarity, the core principle of royalties aligns perfectly with the spirit of decentralization, claiming it to be an ongoing acknowledgment of the creator's worth in each transaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform asserted,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"We stand in solidarity with creators and artists. That's why we will no longer support marketplaces that neglect royalties.&rdquo;</p>\n\nShifting Stance On Royalties\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenSea, a significant player in the NFT market, was initially a vocal advocate for creator royalties, offering rates of up to 10%. However, for the completion of its Blur project, it opted to make NFT creator royalties an optional feature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The marketplace introduced the Operator Filter tool to ensure royalty payments, but this initiative lacked universal buy-in across the Web3 ecosystem. OpenSea's CEO, Devin Finzer, acknowledged this shortfall, stating that the desired empowerment of creators hadn't materialized and recently announced his decision to sunset the Operator Filter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT market is witnessing a trend towards optional creator royalties, leaving creators unpaid upon resale. This policy shift has been adopted by various platforms, including LooksRare, Sudoswap, Magic Eden, and X2Y2. While this move aligns with the evolving landscape, it also raises concerns about the financial well-being of artists.</p>\nRarity's Trading Surges\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the next 24 hours following the announcement, Rarity experienced a notable surge in trading volume. Analytics data from DappRadar illustrated a remarkable 585% spike in 24-hour fiat trading volume on Rarible, surpassing $45,000 on August 23.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While these figures might be modest compared to industry counterparts, Rarity's volume leap outperformed OpenSea and LooksRare. The former saw a trading volume decline of approximately 19%, while the latter experienced a staggering drop of around 74%. On the other hand, X2Y2 observed a volume increase of 8.8% over the same period.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "Crypto expert and author of Civ Kit, an app that lets users build their decentralized marketplace, Ray Youssef,  has recently taken to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account to share his stance on Ethereum and its impact on Bitcoin adoption. Youssef&#8217;s remarks on Ethereum&#8217;s influence over Bitcoin&#8217;s growth trajectory were both striking and laden with implications for the future. Related Reading: Whale Moves 2,910 Bitcoin (BTC) To Exchange Amid FBI Warnings, A Bearish Signal? Ethereum&#8217;s Challenge To Bitcoin Growth On August 23, Ray Youssef who is also a founder of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation, expressed his view that Ethereum, despite its shared objectives with Bitcoin, presents a significant hurdle to Bitcoin&#8217;s broader acceptance.  The crypto expert particularly noted: &#8220;ETH has been the biggest block against Bitcoin adoption.&#8221; Youssef&#8217;s rationale? He suggests that the challenges posed by Ethereum overshadow its utility parallels with Bitcoin. The foundational issues, according to Youssef, lie in Ethereum&#8217;s inherent characteristics. Further amplifying his viewpoint, Youssef highlighted the potential of CivKit, a platform he believes could mimic the necessities of a financial model. In doing so, he suggests that this would effectively sift out deceptive components, leaving them to scammers. ETH has been the biggest block against Bitcoin adoption. At first I saw utility we could copy but the negatives far out weigh any positives. #civkit will replicate what is needed on ultra sound honest money and leave the rest for the scammers. Nuf said https://t.co/4YIvOX3nAF — Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) August 23, 2023 Building on this, Youssef recently pointed out the potential role of BRICS nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, in shaping the future of P2P Bitcoin markets. Civ Kit and Drivechain: The Innovations In The Crypto Space? April saw the release of a whitepaper introducing Civ Kit, a product endorsed by Youssef and other Bitcoin enthusiasts like Antoine Riard and Nicholas Gregory. This tool aims to create a resistant, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace. By combining Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, Civ Kit promises enhanced privacy and security, offering features like decentralized identity, escrowed trades, and P2P messaging protocol. However, the conversation that initially triggered Youssef&#8217;s tweet focused on a discussion between researcher Timoleon Moraitis and Ethereum&#8217;s founder, Vitalik Buterin. This conversation, highlighted by Bitcoin expert Pierre Rochard, revealed Co-Founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s lack of interest in Drivechain, a feature that allows Bitcoin to operate across secondary chains, termed &#8220;sidechains.&#8221; Rochard commented on the significance of this conversation, noting Buterin&#8217;s position could be seen as an informal &#8220;veto&#8221; of Drivechain&#8217;s relevance. I disagree with individual arguments on both sides of this debate, but it&#8217;s great to learn from others especially when we don&#8217;t align. This conversation is interesting because Vitalik is the ideal &#8220;customer&#8221; for Drivechains. If he doesn&#8217;t want it, that&#8217;s almost like a veto. pic.twitter.com/uxG2aFnUvj — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) August 22, 2023 In a further twist, Buterin opined on the changing dynamics of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains since 2019, stating that BTC miners no longer dominate this landscape. Emphasizing the shift in power dynamics, Buterin remarked that even with a majority, miners cannot enforce the acceptance of invalid blocks into the main chain. He underscored that the controlling power now resides with the users.
