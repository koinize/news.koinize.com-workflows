According to its official website, it is used by “Airbitz (mobile wallet), Bitprim (developer interface), Blockchain Commons (decentralized wallet identity), Cancoin (decentralized exchange)” and other applications. SlowMist did not specify which applications that use Libbitcoin, if any, are affected by the vulnerability.</p><p>Cointelegraph reached out to the Libbitcoin Institute through email but had not received a comment at the time of publication.</p><p>SlowMist identified cybersecurity team “Distrust\" as the team that originally discovered the loophole, which is called the “Milk Sad” vulnerability. It was <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39910\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a> to the CEV cybersecurity vulnerability database on Aug. 7.</p><p>According to the post, the Libbitcoin Explorer has a faulty key generation mechanism, allowing private keys to be guessed by attackers. As a result, attackers exploited this vulnerability to steal over $900,000 worth of crypto as of Aug. 10.</p><p>SlowMist emphasized that one attack in particular siphoned away over 9.7441 BTC (approximately $278,318). The firm claims to have “blocked” the address, implying that the team has contacted exchanges to prevent the attacker from cashing out the funds. The team also stated that it will be monitoring the address in case funds are moved elsewhere.</p><p>Four members of the Distrust team, along with eight freelance security consultants who claim to have helped discover the vulnerability, have set up an informational website <a href=\"https://milksad.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">explaining</a> the vulnerability. They explained that the loophole is created when users employ the “bx seed” command to generate a wallet seed. This command “uses the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) initialized with 32 bits of system time,” which lacks sufficient randomness and therefore sometimes produces the same seed for multiple persons.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/6173da9d-1482-4fe2-9bb0-6aac4bf60a8c.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bx seed command producing the same seed twice.

When the user reached out to other Libbitcoin users to try to determine how the BTC could have gone missing, the person found that other users were also having their BTC siphoned away.</p><p>Wallet vulnerabilities continue to pose a problem for crypto users in 2023.

As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,&rdquo; said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G &amp; GC (R&amp;D in Electronics &amp; IT).</p>\n\n<p>The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities&rsquo; roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more &ldquo;Internet Resilient&rdquo;.</p>\nWho Can Participate in the Challenge?\n<p>All of the country&rsquo;s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience.</p>\n<p>The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Austin, Texas, August 10th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Topl&rsquo;s CTO, Dr. Hans Behrens, was invited to present the peer-reviewed Ouroboros Taktikos research at China&rsquo;s prestigious conference in Haikou, China.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Topl, an interoperable blockchain protocol focused on a connected, inclusive, and sustainable global economy, today announces the peer-reviewed acceptance of its research on Ouroboros Taktikos. This consensus mechanism, built on the foundation of Cardano&rsquo;s Ouroboros Praos, shows a throughput increase of 2.9 times and a latency reduction of 5.7 times compared to Praos.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Topl's research indicates that by using a dynamic threshold, throughput and latency can be optimized, resulting in a more responsive network. Whereas Praos derives its name from the Greek term meaning \"calm\" or &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; and is known for its sparse consensus intervals, Taktikos, a Greek term meaning \"arrangement,\" reflects a more dynamic approach to block ordering.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Ouroboros Taktikos research was presented at the International Conference on Blockchain and Trustworthy Systems, known as BlockSys, in Haikou, China, and highlights potential areas of improvement within the Ouroboros consensus model. Topl has already integrated Taktikos into its chain to enhance the security and scalability of its protocol.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Unlike many advancements in the blockchain space, which are typically posted without any third-party validation, Topl's research underwent a rigorous academic peer-review process. The findings were vetted by leading researchers and will be included in the scientific literature, appearing in Springer CCIS. The manuscript will soon be available via Google Scholar alongside the rest of the Ouroboros family of protocols.</p>&ldquo;Our exploration into Ouroboros Taktikos reflects the dedication and curious spirit of the Topl team,&rdquo; says Dr. Hans Behrens, Topl&rsquo;s Chief Technology Officer. &ldquo;For those interested in the nuances of Nakamoto-style proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, Taktikos offers an insightful advancement. We see it as a collaborative evolution in blockchain consensus models, and we're proud of what our team has achieved together.&rdquo;\"The blockchain ecosystem thrives on both breakthroughs and benchmarks,&rdquo; says Jon Woodard, the CEO at Wolfram Blockchain Labs. &ldquo;Ouroboros Taktikos from Topl offers an insightful blend, advocating for technological advances rooted in academic credibility.\"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"></p><p>About Topl</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Topl is a new interoperable blockchain protocol that aims to create a sustainable, inclusive economy. Its mission is to disrupt existing economic systems and empower changemakers worldwide to make a lasting, positive impact. Topl's modular, permissionless proof-of-stake blockchain is transparent, secure, scalable, and energy-efficient. Its technical innovations, including interoperability and eUTxO efficiency, pave the way for economic system innovation by connecting builders across the Topl network. The protocol's transparency, security, and flexibility make it suitable for track and trace applications, carbon and renewable energy credit exchanges, asset tokenization, and other use cases.&nbsp;</p>ContactChief Marketing OfficerClay FainToplc.fain@topl.me"
