    "description": "BNB price (Binance coin) is consolidating below $250 against the US Dollar. The price could start a strong increase if it clears the $245 and $250 resistance levels. Binance coin price is struggling to gain pace above the $250 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $245 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $240 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain bullish momentum above $245 and $250. Binance Coin Price Eyes Fresh Increase In the past few days, BNB price saw a couple of swing moves from $245. The bulls struggled to push the price above the $250 resistance. The price reacted to the downside a couple of times and tested the $235 support zone. A low is formed near $253.6 and the price is attempting a fresh increase, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $240 resistance. The price spiked above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $262 swing high to the $235 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $240 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. BNB price is now trading below $245 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, it is facing resistance near the $245 level. The next major resistance is near $250 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $262 swing high to the $235 low. A close above the $250 resistance might increase the chances of a push above the $255 resistance. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $255 resistance might start a steady increase. The next major resistance is near the $262 level, above which the price might rise toward the $270 resistance. Another Decline in BNB?

If there is a downside break below the $232 support, the price could drop toward the $220 support. Any more losses could send the price toward the $212 support.
