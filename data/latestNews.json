Ferrante also runs Backpack, a cryptocurrency wallet which is integrated in Backpack Exchange.</p><p>Sun’s former legal deputy at FTX, Claire Zhang, who is also Ferrante’s wife, is also on Trek’s executive team. However, once Trek raises an investment round, Zhang plans to transition  out of the company as she has been working without pay to “help bootstrap the exchange,\" WSJ said.</p><p>Sun and Ferrante iterated they wanted to use the lessons learned from FTX’s failure to protect customer funds. Backpack’s technology offers a self-custody solution which integrates a multiparty computation (MPC) technique to ensure funds remain secure. MPC typically involves several parties approving a transaction before funds are moved.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With things heating up, please be aware of phishing attacks on the rise. <br><br>Backpack will NEVER ask you for your private keys.<br><br>The only valid website URLs are in our bio.
