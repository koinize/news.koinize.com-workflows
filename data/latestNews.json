He didn’t specify how many people had to leave Yuga Labs as part of the restructuring.</p><p>Yuga Labs CEO Alegre also assured that his top priority during restructuring was to “ensure that those leaving Yuga are treated with the respect and gratitude they deserve.” He claimed that Yuga’s transition package included “generous severance,” the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act coverage, and assistance in finding new job opportunities. The CEO added:</p><blockquote>“It's a challenging time, not only for our industry but also for the global economy. [...] The restructure today impacts U.S. team members, and we are actively reviewing the impact on our international teams.”</blockquote><p>Yuga Labs did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/microsoft-activision-buy-metaverse-office-crypto-gaming\"><strong><em>Microsoft’s Activision buy may see more metaverse in the office and crypto in gaming</em></strong></a></p><p>The news comes amid a U.S. appeals court on Oct. 16 expressing skepticism about an attempt to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/appeals-court-judges-skeptical-ryder-ripps-bored-ape-appeal\">dismiss Yuga Labs’ trademark lawsuit against artist Ryder Ripps</a> over his copies of Yuga' BAYC NFTs.</p><p>Previously, a group of BAYC investors in August 2023 <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-bored-ape-sotheby-s-and-yuga-labs-respond-to-lawsuit-from-bored-ape-investors\">filed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs</a> and fine arts auction house Sotheby, alleging that the auction house helped Yuga Labs “deceptively promote” the NFT collection.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/minecraft-bans-bitcoin-play-earn-iphone-15-crypto-gaming-formulae-preview-web3-gamer/\"><strong><em>Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 &amp; crypto gaming, Formula E</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
