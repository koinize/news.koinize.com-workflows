According to Bloomberg, seven applications for a spot Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) ETF have been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/fidelity-jumps-into-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-fresh-sec-filing?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">filed</a> this year. Like WisdomTree and Invesco, Fidelity was making a second try at a spot BTC ETF. Similar to other spot BTC ETF applications, this one <a href=\"https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-044.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">stated</a> that the CME Bitcoin Futures market “represents a regulated market of significant size as it relates […] to the spot bitcoin market.” It argued the point in detail and cited extensive research to support its view. The 193-page application said:</p><blockquote>“The lack of a Spot Bitcoin ETP [exchange-traded product] exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a Spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means.” </blockquote><p>It went on to mention the bankrupt FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and Voyager Digital as riskier alternatives of the past. It also argued that investors may buy shares in companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy — that is, unrelated businesses that have significant BTC investments — to gain BTC exposure themselves.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-stock-price-more-than-doubles-in-2023-in-lockstep-with-bitcoin\">MicroStrategy’s stock price more than doubles in 2023 in lockstep with Bitcoin</a></em></strong></p><p>Fidelity Digital Assets Services, a regulated custodian licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services, would be responsible for custody of the trust’s BTC.

They spent a lot of time with him, Gary Gensler spent a lot of time with him. And then they had this huge situation that happened. And that was very embarrassing. And so now the pendulum has swung too far to over-regulation in this ridiculous prosecutorial oversight.\"</blockquote><p>When asked for his opinion concerning the crypto regulatory environment in Canada compared to the U.S., Scaramucci stated that \"Canada actually learned from the United States and set it up the way we used to do things in the United States.\" He explained:</p><blockquote>\"They went to the industry they said, Okay, how do we fairly regulate the industry? How do we protect ourselves from bad actors? Most of the industry players know that In the various people in the industry, and then they worked alongside their legislature to come up with guidelines.\"</blockquote><p>\"We're watching the Canadian crypto digital asset space thrive,\" Scaramucci continued. For the politician and business magnate, Scaramucci has his eyes set on Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who also happens to be a Canadian national, on leading the future of cryptocurrency exchanges in the wake of FTX's collapse:</p><blockquote>\"I'm gonna give him an A on execution and growing Binance. It's 65 ish percent of the overall market. So I'll give him an A on that. He probably gets a C+ or B on transparency around it.\" Maybe in the beginning, they had some things that they did there that were regrettable. But it's just the SEC that is suing them; we have yet to see anything criminal.</blockquote><p>For closing statements, Scaramucci stated that while CZ will continue to get \"a lot of flaming arrows,\" he will continue to be the \"most influential person\" in crypto. \"He does actually have the largest platform, and it's that one that can gain mass adoption, while still being a legitimate source where they're gonna continue to operate in all major jurisdictions in the world,\" said Scaramucci.</p><p><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sbf-game-decentraland-pyramid-destroyed-animoca-brands-mma-game/\">‘Ethical’ SBF game axed, Web3 games sign-up process sucks, Tomb Chaser</a></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template>\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "
