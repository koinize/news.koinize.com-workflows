However, customers who have not been able to access their funds for months due to the breach were not mollified by the announcements. They raised questions, including how the token was backed and why Patricia converted them without customer consent. A major question is when they will be able to access their funds.

    "description": "\n                        <p dir=\"ltr\">In light of several U.S.-based banks severing their crypto ties, stablecoin issuer Tether has partnered up with Bahamas-based private bank Britannia for dollar transfer processing.&nbsp;</p>\nTether Turns To Bahamas For Banking Needs&nbsp;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the latest reports, Tether has integrated the Britannia Bank &amp; Trust Ltd. to process dollar transfers on its platforms. Although the stablecoin issuer has not directly addressed these reports and it is not clear when the banking relationship between the two started, people familiar with the matter have claimed that Tether had instructed clients to send money to Britannia&rsquo;s bank account in the last few months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The firm has also integrated other banks like Deltec and Capital Union into its platform.&nbsp;</p>\nBanking Exodus Among Crypto Firms\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There has been a recent spike in regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Regulators are coming down harder on crypto firms and on banks that associate with them. They clearly do not want a repeat of last year&rsquo;s FTX massacre, which spread like a contagion, taking down financial institutions like Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to the increasing oversight into banks associated with crypto firms, many US-based crypto firms have had to turn offshore to look for banking partners. The integration of the Bahamas-based Britannia Bank indicates that Tether, too, has had to join the ranks of the firms driven out of the U.S for their banking needs. The integration will allow the firm to process its dollar transfers.&nbsp;</p>\nTether&rsquo;s Growth In 2023\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since stablecoins are pegged on a 1:1 ratio to the US dollar, it is highly useful, especially to crypto traders who use them to move their digital assets from one exchange to the other. A significant chunk of these traders particularly use Tether&rsquo;s USDT stablecoin due to its popularity and extensive market cap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The USDT has had a solid run, despite the market instability during the first quarter of 2023. It rallied over 20% during those four months and reached a market cap of $80 billion despite the market crisis. Currently, it has stabilized at a market cap of $82.9 billion, occupying 66.5% of the total crypto market.&nbsp;</p>\nConcerns Over Asset Reserves\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the firm has remained vague about how it accesses and stores its billions of dollars of assets that are used to back the dollar, leading to some concern in the market. The company was almost in some legal trouble with a class-action lawsuit that was filed on charges that Tether had falsely advertised its USDT stablecoin. However, the lawsuit was dismissed, citing a lack of merit by the court judge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At around 3pm BST a one hour candle shot up over 6%, subsided a little, and then continued to reach as high as 8.2% within a 3-hour period.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most importantly, the surge took bitcoin back above its 200-week and 200-day moving averages which it had lost a couple of weeks previously. The battle will now be on to stay above these moving averages and once more reclaim its bull momentum.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Investors will now be asking themselves if they climb into this bitcoin pump or if they adopt a wait-and-see approach. It any are convinced in the upwards price action then today&rsquo;s test of the moving average would perhaps be a good time to get in.</p>\nBulls or bears?\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the bears will not be giving in without a fight and might believe they still have the upper hand. Bitcoin losing the trendline it had been respecting since the beginning of the year, and also dipping and confirming below the 200-week moving average were huge battles to win.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be that as it may, the bull/bear war is still very much on. Bitcoin bulls will be hoping for a weekly close above the 200 MA, and a monthly close (tomorrow) the same. Bitcoin has quite a long wick below on the monthly so this could also be a sign that the price is being bought up.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the latest data from DeFiLlama, Lido Finance&#8217;s TVL witnessed a notable augmentation, securing its place as the most substantial growth among the top five DeFi protocols. This feat underlines Lido&#8217;s exceptional capacity to adapt and expand, distinguishing itself from its counterparts during a pivotal time for the DeFi sector. Lido Finance TVL. Source: DeFiLlama Despite the tumultuous price fluctuations that have characterized the altcoin realm, Lido&#8217;s TVL growth stood unwavering. This achievement can be attributed to a discernible surge in Ethereum deposits within the protocol over the reviewed timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Records Surprising 15% Rally – What’s Behind It?

Even in the face of significant market price gyrations, Ethereum holders exhibited a commendable degree of confidence in Lido&#8217;s liquid staking protocol.  LDO has a market cap of $1.47 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Recent technical analysis highlights that the platform saw a cumulative total of 185,500 ETH deposits in the last seven days alone.
