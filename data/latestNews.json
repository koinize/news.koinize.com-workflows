We do transactions every day, we work for money, we save money, but no one teaches us about it. If you want to make a change, people and families need to learn about money.”</blockquote><p>Martínez believes Bitcoin is the “latest evolution of money,” and by teaching kids about the benefits of Bitcoin — in combination with other life skills — they’ll be able to seek better employment opportunities.</p><p>“If they know English, have computer skills, know about Bitcoin and know about marketing, they can work remotely for anyone around the world,” he explained. “This is a big door that is open now for everyone.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The future looks better! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/God?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#God</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/surf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#surf</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Surfparatodos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Surfparatodos</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbeach?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bitcoinbeach</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sGpQtuyRsg\">pic.twitter.com/sGpQtuyRsg</a></p>&mdash; Roman Martínez⚡️ (chimbera) (@romanmartinezc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/romanmartinezc/status/1682760044612403201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>According to its <a href=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f46d2bb7cca38461c7b8e13/62e049dd5f62fb5c824f1e34_bitcoinbeach.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">whitepaper</a>, Bitcoin Beach is a movement to ensure Bitcoin’s potential is realized by helping those who have been excluded from the banking system.</p><p>It’s based in El Zonte — a beach town around an hour’s drive southwest of the nation’s capital, San Salvador, and one of the first areas in the country to start accepting Bitcoin.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-can-be-used-in-classrooms-and-deliver-financial-literacy\"><strong><em>How crypto can be used in classrooms — and deliver financial literacy </em></strong></a></p><p>Another Bitcoin education nonprofit based in El Salvador is My First Bitcoin, which has helped 25,000 students <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/education-is-key-to-financial-freedom-says-bitcoin-advocate-najah-roberts\">obtain a “Bitcoin Diploma”</a> through the country’s public school system.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"> New Video Out Now! <br><br>25,000 students have been educated about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bitcoin</a> in El Salvador. <br>I visited <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyfirstBitcoin_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MyfirstBitcoin_</a> to find out how they plan to change the world.  <br><br>Full <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElSalvador?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ElSalvador</a> Video Below <a href=\"https://t.co/CL5bVgxH8K\">pic.twitter.com/CL5bVgxH8K</a></p>&mdash; Max DeMarco ⚡️ (@itsmaxdemarco) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsmaxdemarco/status/1691455882394316802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Around 70% of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/banking-the-unbanked-how-defi-can-help-the-low-income-population\">El Salvadorians are currently unbanked</a>.
