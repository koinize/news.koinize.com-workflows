    "description": "The crypto market has experienced somewhat of a resurgence in recent times. Shiba Inu (SHIB) happens to be one of the altcoins that many seem to have their eyes on during this period. And if the prediction of this machine learning algorithm is anything to go by, it would seem that these SHIB holders are well positioned for more profitable times ahead. SHIB’s Projected Price By December According to data from the price prediction algorithm on the crypto analytics platform CoinCodex, SHIB’s price is predicted to hit $0.000009534 by December 11. Such price action will represent about a 10% increase from its current price.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready To Take-Off? Analyst Who Predicted $37,000 Reveals What’s Next Meanwhile, the sentiment around the token continues to be bullish, which suggests that many expect the token to rally further despite the impressive gains it has already recorded.  With such a bullish sentiment, CoinCodex’s prediction seems more attainable as the ecosystem could see more whales and retail investors jump in on the token. If that happens, it could further add to the buying pressure, an important metric to determine if SHIB could continue riding on this momentum to attain CoinCodex’s prediction by December. In line with the bullish sentiment, CoinCodex noted that 24 technical analysis indicators are signaling bullish signals, with only a mere 4 indicators signaling bearish signals. Based on its forecast, the platform predicts that now remains a good time to buy the meme coin despite the impressive gains it has already recorded.  Another important metric that CoinCodex highlighted was the fact Shiba Inu’s RSI value currently stands at around 63.05, indicating that the token is neither oversold nor overbought. As to the exact time to buy the token, investors might be able to take a cue from CoinCodex’s five-day prediction as the platform expects a correction to around $0.000008008.  The Fundamentals Are Aligning For Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu ecosystem has continued to record interesting developments that suggest that the fundamentals are as bullish as the charts and technical analysis. Most recently, the SHIB non-custodial wallet was launched in a bid to promote the ecosystem’s vision of a decentralized state and enhance the crypto experience of Shibizens.  Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s $4.6 Billion Bitcoin Bet Pays Off, Here’s How Much It’s Worth Now Interestingly, the wallet is equipped with certain features that address the fears of using a non-custodial wallet. One of them happens to be a feature that allows users to recover their tokens even if they were to forget their seed phrase. The wallet also integrated Web3Auth to make the user onboarding experience effortless and straightforward. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.000009465, up by over 14% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  SHIB crosses $0.0000092 &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Times Tabloid, chart from Tradingview.com"
