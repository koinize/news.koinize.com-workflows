    "description": "Two Fantom Foundation wallets on Ethereum and the Fantom Network have fallen victim to a phishing attack, losing over $650,000, according to reports from CertiK, a blockchain security firm. Another report by &#8220;Spreakaway&#8221; on X alleges that one of Fantom&#8217;s team members also lost $3.4 million. Fantom Foundation Falls Victim To Phishing Attack Fantom Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Fantom ecosystem. On the other hand, Fantom is a scalable, layer-1 blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. Like the world&#8217;s most valuable network, the platform supports the deployment of smart contracts. For clarity, Fantom&#8217;s network was not hacked; the foundation&#8217;s wallets were compromised. Related Reading: Time To Cash Out? Bitcoin’s 4-Hour RSI Triggers Sell Indicator According to CertiK, the Fantom Foundation lost $470,000 on Fantom and at least $187,000 on Ethereum. Following the attack, Etherscan data show that the scammers consolidated funds into one account, holding at least $7 million of various coins. The address has already been marked and identified as a facilitator of multiple phishing campaigns impacting crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  Reports on Reddit show that Fantom Foundation fell victim to a &#8220;zero day&#8221; exploit on Chrome, a web browser, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands worth of FTM. In a screenshot of a Telegram conversation said to have been shared by a Fantom admin, the foundation acknowledged that &#8220;some&#8221; of their wallets were &#8220;drained.&#8221; They are actively tracking the movement of stolen funds.  Zero Day Exploit, FTM Sinks Even Lower  A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability unknown to the developer or its tech team, who might be able to fix it. Because the flaw isn&#8217;t known to the team, the threat actor can exploit it until it is patched. This is why zero-day exploits can be consequential, especially for DeFi protocols whose infrastructure relies on flawed software.

In the same screenshot shared on Reddit, a representative of Fantom Foundation said they didn&#8217;t update their browser to the latest version. The latest Chrome browser update, version 118.0.5993.70, was released on October 11. Following this news, FTM fell roughly 5% and is now rocking close to multi-month lows. If bears press on, the coin may drop below 2022 lows. As such, it will reverse all gains made in the first half of 2023. At this year&#8217;s peaks, FTM prices rose to as high as $0.65 in February 2023 before contracting to spot rates. The coin is trading at approximately $0.17 and under intense selling pressure.
