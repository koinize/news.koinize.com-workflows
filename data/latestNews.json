The drop coincided with the U.S. dollar index's (DXY) rise. The dollar's <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-stuck\">correlation</a> with cryptocurrencies has been consistently negative since July.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/74a1306f-bd35-4713-9c2c-d4dc950220e6.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USD versus crypto market capitalization's daily performance chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>XRP's decline appears to be part of a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-stuck\">sideways consolidation trend</a>. Traders are buying and flipping XRP for a profit as soon as the price increases. Thus, they have kept its price trapped inside a narrow trading range of $0.49-0.51.</p><h2>XRP decline precedes potential whale dump</h2><p>One of the possible reasons behind increased XRP sell-pressure is likely large whale transfers. </p><p>For instance, on Sep. 3, an anonymous address <a href=\"https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ripple/B1139EB48F91262C29E5F19561A74867450D5C3B2EB98FAFAFFEB4C8DA719017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sent</a> 29.7 million XRP tokens worth around $15 million to the BitStamp exchange.

For instance, the XRP supply held by entities with a balance between 1 million and 10 million tokens (brown) has declined since Sep. 3.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/1ffce92d-9fa3-4855-b373-2141779db12e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP supply among whales. Source: Santiment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, XRP supply held by whales with a balance between 100 million and 1 billion tokens (green) has dropped in the same period. Interestingly, the 10 million-100 million XRP balance cohort (black) has absorbed the supply from the 100 million-1 billion balance cohort.</p><h2>XRP price analysis for September</h2><p>From a technical standpoint, XRP appears to have entered the breakdown stage of its prevailing <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-trade-bull-and-bear-flag-patterns\">bear pennant</a> pattern.</p><p>A bear pennant is a bearish continuation pattern, characterized by the price consolidating inside a range defined by a falling trendline resistance and a rising trendline support. It resolves after the price breaks below the lower trendline and falls by as much as the previous decline height.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/86655d9b-9495-443b-b3bd-1f2b83d3fb5d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>As a result of this technical analysis rule, XRP price risks falling toward $0.40 in September 2023, about 20% lower than current price levels. </p><p>Conversely, a close above XRP's 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $0.52 may invalidate or delay the bear pennant breakdown. Instead, the price is poised to rise toward the pennant's upper trendline near $0.54 or the 50-day EMA (the red wave) near $0.56.</p><p>This bullish scenario can result in a 7-15% price rally in September from current price levels.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
