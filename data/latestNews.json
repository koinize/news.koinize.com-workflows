While certain roles have been impacted, these changes are necessary to evolve as an organization. <br>For more see a note written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dalegre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dalegre</a> on our <a href=\"https://t.co/722YfqwaCB\">https://t.co/722YfqwaCB</a> official blog.</p>&mdash; Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1710301985608540598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>“I realized very quickly that there were a number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies,” he said, adding that: </p><blockquote>“To create truly amazing experiences that matter to our communities and our business, we need to place our bets on fewer key initiatives and team up with complementary external partners to make these experiences happen.”</blockquote><p>Moving forward, Alegre outlined that the firm will ramp up its focus on community building, “going all-in” on its Otherside metaverse project and securing brand partnerships. </p><h3>Nike’s new Web3 sneaker </h3><p>Nike’s Web3 unit .SWOOSH has unveiled its first physical sneaker line called the Air Force 1 Low TINAJ. </p><p>The sneakers contain a mixture of white and black panels and features blue .SWOOSH logos. </p><p>As per an Oct. 5 announcement on X, the sneakers will only be available to .SWOOSH members who purchase and open at least one OF1 Box NFT before the Oct. 16 deadline.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meet the newest member of the .SWOOSH family, TINAJ <br><br>Our first ever physical sneaker is here!
