We’re seeing it through all the platforms, and there’s just not a lot of institutional excitement right now.”</blockquote><p>The claims <a href=\"https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-133-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-d1962cf39cea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">echo</a> a May 31 report from Coinshare’s head of research James Butterfill, which detailed that institutional buying of digital assets saw outflows totaling $39 million as of last week, the sixth consecutive week of outflows.</p><p>Novogratz has however pointed to two significant developments in Asia that may help shift the tide.</p><p>First, he pointed out that Chinese social media app <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/yuan-stablecoin-team-arrested-wechats-new-bitcoin-prices-hk-crypto-rules-asia-express/\">WeChat now offers Bitcoin</a> (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) price quotes on its app, something he considers a significant milestone given its popularity. At the time of writing WeChat has 1.3 billion monthly active users, according to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data</a> from Statista. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wechat is available for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> search and only Bitcoin.

But it’s not just institutions, retail investors have been hit in the hip pocket by cost of living pressures,” he said. </p><p>As crypto firms are scrambling to come to grips with an <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sen-elizabeth-warren-points-to-crypto-payments-as-facilitating-fentanyl-trade-in-china\">ever-more precarious regulatory landscape</a> in the U.S., Honan still expects there to be a strong price recovery when large firms decide to jump back in. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/last-btc-price-dip-before-a-30k-breakout-bitcoin-wipes-weekend-gains\"><strong><em>Last BTC price dip before a $30K breakout?

I just don’t expect that to happen in the US until one of two things happens,” he said.</p><p>“You either need settled and sensible rules in place for crypto. Or you need the Republicans to win next year’s U.S. elections. Crypto has almost overnight become a crazily partisan issue, which is exactly what the industry didn’t want or need.”</p><p>Much like Novogratz, Honan says that Hong Kong presents a unique opportunity for the crypto market, unleashing a new wave of investors into the market as well as offering up a place for U.S.-based firms to set up shop if need be. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chinese Central Television station has just broadcast news regarding Hong Kong letting people buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other coins.<br><br>This is huge news!

If Hong Kong is being used by mainland China as a testing ground for the safe adoption of crypto, it would be a significant tailwind for the market,” Honan said. “We’ve all been looking West for the next bull trigger. Maybe we should have been looking East.”</p><p>With Hong Kong now opened up for crypto-related business, a growing number of firms are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-hong-kong-licenses-june-retail-opening\">currently jostling to secure</a> a license. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
