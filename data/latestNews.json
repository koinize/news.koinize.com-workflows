He invited Musk to the desktop Linux community a day after Musk complained about not being able to install Microsoft’s Windows OS on his newly bought computer without a Microsoft account.</p><p>Like Windows, iOS and macOS, Linux is an OS, but unlike most others, Linux is open-source. The Linux OS was first released in September 1991, and over the years, it has gained popularity with a niche user base. Today, popular mobile OS Android is powered by the Linux OS.</p><p>Open-source software has its source code available for anyone to see, alter and improve. When a computer program’s source code is available to programmers, they can enhance it by adding new features or correcting malfunctioning sections.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-solution-elon-musk-microsoft-os\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
