This year, Christmas family dinner may be less awkward for crypto proponents who had the tricky task in 2022 of explaining why everything had collapsed around the digital currency ecosystem.</p><p>That’s because things have changed again for crypto — rapidly — over the past quarter, with Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) recovering above $40,000 and most altcoins already having won back more than half of the value they shed during the bear market. With a critical bull run catalyst in the form of Bitcoin’s block reward halving just months away, this is an excellent time to be “the crypto person” at Christmas dinner. </p><p>Indeed, there’s no better time to be a crypto bro at any family gathering than just before a bull run. Topics of discussion can leap from crypto investment advice to what’s on the regulatory front, memecoins, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and much more. Cointelegraph has prepared an outline of topics and discussions that might come in handy to answer any family members’ curious queries.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/christmas-dinner-crypto-talk-menu-better-this-year\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
