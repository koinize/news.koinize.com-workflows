Bitcoin's hash rate represents how fast a mining machine operates when trying to calculate a valid block hash.</p><p>A snapshot of Foundry's pool in December 2021 shows a different picture. At the time, Texas controlled 8.43% of the country's hash rate, Georgia had 34.17%. Meanwhile, Kentucky stood at 12.40% and New York held 9.53% of the U.S. hash rate. Compared to 2021, more U.S. states are mining Bitcoin this year.</p><p>Overall, by July 2023, the Bitcoin global hash rate had reached 400 EH/s, nearly twice as high as at the end of 2021, when it stood at 174 EH/s, said Foundry. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/dcc492ff-0085-4b9b-af8c-a41a79b88a23.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hashrate Map in July 2023. Source: Foundry USA</em></figcaption></figure><p>The data was pulled between July 21-27, 2023, when Texas faced power curtailment. According to the report, the data captured during curtailments means that the Texas hash rate may be \"higher than what’s reported on the map.\"</p><p>During power curtailment, Bitcoin miners lower their production to balance energy supply and demand in the grid. Essentially, it is a way to balance energy consumption during peak times. In Texas, a program grants large energy consumers, such as Bitcoin miners, incentives for being flexible with energy use.</p><p>One of the Bitcoin miners participating in Texas' curtailment program is Riot Platforms. In August, the company <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/riot-platforms-texas-energy-strategy-reduced-production-costs-31-million\">mined fewer Bitcoin than in July</a> but received over $31 million in power credits from the state. </p><p>Texas has been evolving as a hub for crypto mining thanks to its cheaper energy and welcoming regulatory framework. The state's electricity prices are below the U.S. average, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. </p><p>As of January 2023, Texas's average residential electricity tariff was $0.14 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), an 8.3% discount <a href=\"https://quickelectricity.com/cost-of-electricity-per-kwh-by-state/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">compared</a> to the national average of $0.15 per kWh. The costs are even lower for large consumers like crypto miners.</p><p>The state became a hotbed for large mining operations following <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/death-knell-for-chinese-crypto-miners-rigs-on-the-move-after-gov-t-crackdown\">China's crackdown on crypto mining in 2021</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/orange-pill-children-bitcoin-kids-books/\"><strong><em>Should you ‘orange pill’ children?

    "description": "The Bitcoin price has been trading sideways for a while now but this will not always be the case. While there is a chance that the price could end up swinging downward and crashing, a crypto analyst has predicted that a surge in the cryptocurrency’s price is on the horizon. Bitcoin Price Breakout Is Coming A crypto analyst who has grown to prominence on the TradingView site has put forward a bullish prediction for the Bitcoin price. The analyst who goes by the pseudonym Tolberti mapped out a yellow trend line which he believes points toward the next bull rally for the coin. Related Reading: Early Rejection Of 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF Sparks Concerns The trend line sits just above the $26,000 level which means that the cryptocurrency is currently close to it. The analyst explains that the BTC price remains bullish despite recent performance, especially as the month of October draws close. Using the Fibonacci retracement which sat at 0.618, Tolberti points out the next significant resistance for Bitcoin. From here, he puts it at $29,167, which after beating, the analyst expects the Bitcoin price to surge above $30,000. A surge of this magnitude would mean that the Bitcoin price rises at least 15% from its current level. Tolberti's chart outlining the forecast &#124; Source: Tradingview.com However, it is not all easy sailing from here as the bears will not give up the fight easily. Speaking about the yellow trend line, the analyst said it is “a gateway to the ultra-huge bull market. Once it breaks, I expect a massive uptrend.” But he cautioned traders to “be aware of a possible retest first. Your stop-loss needs to be safe!” How High Can BTC Price Go? Tolberti’s bullish profile for the Bitcoin price also runs through to the long term. Just like a lot of other analysts, Tolberti expects the cryptocurrency to trade in the six digits in the next bull market. For his long-term prediction, he puts Bitcoin at a price of $125,000. According to a previous analyst, he believes that the Bitcoin price will reach this level sometime in the second quarter of 2025. Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency the analyst is bullish on. Altcoins were not left out of the post with the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP making an appearance as other bullish tokens. Related Reading: Upcoming Optimism Unlock Threatens To Drag OP Below $1 Given this forecast, Tolberti believes that the current price of Bitcoin is a good price for investors to buy. “26k is still a good price for Bitcoin to buy in the long term because I expect 120k in 2025,” the post read. Bitcoin is currently showing strength because it continues to hold above $26,000 after the SEC delayed the 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF decision. It is currently trending at $26,275, although it’s down 3% in the last week.
