    "description": "\n                        <p dir=\"ltr\">The crypto market is at the edge of perhaps another move to the downside. Binance token $BNB needs to bounce soon, or face a drop into the void.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The crypto market is in the red for yet another day. Bitcoin is flirting with $26,000 currently, and should it now fall and go through the support at $25,000 then things could get rather uncomfortable indeed for the entire crypto sector.</p>\nA bounce in sight?\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, bitcoin is battling and bulls do not look as though they will go down without a real fight. A rather large gap on CME is open above, with the upper bound at $27,620. Given that bitcoin is also looking quite oversold, a potential bounce could be seen later today or tomorrow.</p>\nPlenty of bad news around\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is plenty of really negative news on the global financial front, such as Chinese property developer Evergrande going into bankruptcy, but these sorts of events are nearly always priced into the market.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With global financial markets at the edge of their own black hole, there will definitely be a need for bitcoin, which is outside of the huge timebomb of &pound;1 quadrillion + in derivatives. Holders should think of this before selling.</p>\nBinance continues to suffer\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One issue within the crypto ecosystem is that of the continuing SEC persecution of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. Having already published its intentions to sue the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, the enforcement overhang is having a deleterious effect on Binance.</p>\n$BNB on the brink\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the $BNB exchange token things are looking rather shaky. From a technical perspective, $BNB has fallen out of its bear flag and has lost the $220 support. A measured move out of the flag should still see $BNB fall a lot further, but this is probably immaterial as there is really no kind of decent support until under $50, which is a more than 4x drop into the abyss from here.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Should such a calamity befall $BNB, and the exchange goes into a nosedive, the impact for the rest of crypto could potentially be far worse than the FTX and LUNA meltdowns, putting the bull market on hold.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If this worst case scenario does come into fruition it should be remembered that bitcoin, ethereum, and some of the fundamentally stronger cryptos might be at bargain basement prices. Investors should do their research.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "Dogecoin Lead Developer, Mishaboar has expressed his doubts about a possible move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus. The developer has stated that the transition to a POS mechanism is not a “sensible approach” and has highlighted several issues that could develop from the change. Mishaboar Objects To PoS Transition Mishaboar took to social media on August 20, to express his concerns about the potential impacts a PoS transformation could have on Dogecoin’s network and decentralized nature. In a recent Twitter post, he staunchly refuted the transition and stated that if the conversion pulls through, he may leave Dogecoin for another cryptocurrency network with a PoW consensus.  Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Avoids Market Crash, Do They Know Something You Don’t? “If this refers to a remote possibility of Doge ever switching to PoS, after what I have seen over the past 2 years, I would probably then move to another PoW crypto and customize the logo in my wallet to have a dog in it,” Mishaboar commented in a Twitter post.  Mishaboar has highlighted the possibilities of power imbalances that could result from a PoS switch since a significant amount of a cryptocurrency’s supply is controlled by exchanges.  He stated that the change to a PoS consensus could increase the control and influence of exchanges over a network. The developer also pointed out that Dogecoin may face increased regulatory challenges with the transition.  Furthermore, Mishaboar explained that cryptocurrencies that have transitioned to a PoS consensus have been overhyped, with most falling short of expectations and failing considerably or becoming so centralized that it contradicts the foundational structure of cryptocurrencies which is in its decentralized system.  Mishaboar concludes that transitioning into a PoS consensus does not align with Dogecoin’s futuristic goals and objectives. He mentioned that the benefits of a PoS consensus which is fast transactions can easily be achieved in the Dogecoin network with other solutions like integration of multiple payment channels. DOGE price struggles to recover &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com PoS Versus PoW Consensus For Dogecoin Ecosystem The broader cryptocurrency community is presently at loggerheads on the merits of a PoS and PoW consensus and Mishaboar’s rejection of a possible Dogecoin transition has sparked debates about the future of Dogecoin cryptocurrency among crypto enthusiasts.  Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (POS) are two distinct blockchain consensus mechanisms used to validate transactions and improve the general performance of a blockchain network. And these two consensuses have their different advantages and disadvantages.  The advantages of a PoS are seen in its energy conservation and fast transactions. In contrast, a PoW consensus is considered more secure and more decentralized but is energy-intensive.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Shows Public Support For Pro-Crypto Presidential Candidate Some crypto investors argue that a PoS consensus would offer greater energy utilization and scalability. Whereas, others have sided with Mishaboar, strongly refuting the idea of centralization and security risks that follow a PoS transition. Mishaboar has been a prominent part of Dogecoin’s development, yet recent statements made by the enigmatic figure have led to speculations about the impact his rejection of Dogecoin’s possible PoS consensus could have on the project&#8217;s direction and development.
