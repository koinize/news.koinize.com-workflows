    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-400-surge-to-200000/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Dave the Wave has shared a bullish prediction for the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. He believes that the crypto token could rise to as high as $200,000 and even provided a timeframe using technical analysis. When Bitcoin Will Hit $200,000 In a post shared on his X platform, Dave the Wave shared an accompanying chart that put Bitcoin’s price at $200,000 on December 1, 2025. Alongside this, he made known the fact that BTC&#8217;s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator seems very bullish.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rallies To 4-Month Highs – Can Bulls Take It Above $0.3? The crypto analyst went on to give another scenario on how things could play out in terms of this price projection. According to him, Bitcoin hitting $200,000 could be front-run by a year, meaning that it could happen as soon as December 1, 2024. He noted that this could happen when most people are anticipating this price level.  Dave the Wave had also earlier predicted that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high before the year ran out. Based on the chart he shared then, he hinted that the BTC price could hit $69,000 this year. The crypto analyst doesn’t seem to have given up on that happening, as he recently shared an updated chart suggesting that Bitcoin could still hit that price level before 2024. BTC price clears $41,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Above $41,000 The flagship cryptocurrency broke above $41,000 to so much excitement from the crypto community. Bitcoin is on a run right now and many believe that it is only up from here on. The reason for this rally has so far been attributed partly to an imminent approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Others believe that it is simply because the Bitcoin Halving is around the corner. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Explode: Analyst Identifies Trigger For Next Parabolic Move Whatever the reason is, what is most obvious is the significant amount of investors trooping into the crypto market right now, with Bitcoin in particular. Two weeks ago, BTC saw inflows totaling US$312m, bringing its year-to-date inflows to just over US$1.5 billion. Liquidity is also flowing into the ecosystem of other tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and BNB.  With Bitcoin above $40,000, Dave the Wave seems more optimistic than ever. In one of his most recent X posts, he mentioned that BTC could go “parabolic” if it breaks the upward channel. From the chart he shared, $44,000 seems to be the next stop for the flagship cryptocurrency.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,400, up by over 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Decrypt, chart from Tradingview.com"
