Markups are sessions in which lawmakers discuss the details of a bill. It is a crucial step before a legislation moves to the House floor. </p><p>One of the bills is the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act, or H.R. 3712, that prohibits the Federal Reserve from initiating pilot programs to test CBDCs without approval from Congress.​​ The legislation was<a href=\"https://mooney.house.gov/congressman-mooney-introduces-the-digital-dollar-pilot-prevention-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> introduced</a> by Representative Alex Mooney in May. </p><p>The Fed recently denied any decision on<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-service-not-related-to-cbdcs\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-service-not-related-to-cbdcs/amp\"> whether to issue a CBDC</a>, claiming it “would only proceed with the issuance of a CBDC with an authorizing law.” However, the Federal Reserve of San Francisco<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-san-francisco-hiring-crypto-architect-cbdc-project\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-san-francisco-hiring-crypto-architect-cbdc-project/amp\"> has sought to fill technical positions for a CBDC project</a> over the past few months, indicating that the digital dollar remains on the table. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEW?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NEW</a>: Chairman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PatrickMcHenry</a> announces a markup of legislation to strengthen American national security and prevent the issuance of a central bank digital currency.<br><br> Read more <a href=\"https://t.co/oy3oASJYkA\">https://t.co/oy3oASJYkA</a></p>— Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1702867735405855110?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The second legislation is an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-emmer-anti-cbdc-bill-reintroduced\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/tom-emmer-anti-cbdc-bill-reintroduced/amp\">prohibiting Fed banks</a> from offering certain products or services directly to an individual, along with prohibiting the use of CBDCs for monetary policy, and for other purposes. </p><p>\"A Federal reserve bank shall not offer a central bank digital currency, or any digital asset that is substantially similar under any other name or label, indirectly to an individual through a financial institution or other intermediary,\"<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr5403/BILLS-118hr5403ih.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> reads</a> the bill. </p><p>The prospect of a digital dollar has stirred controversy in the United States.
