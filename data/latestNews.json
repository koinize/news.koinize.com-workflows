In the last three years, the crypto market has affected and changed lives positively — mine included. And this is why I am a massive advocate of cryptocurrencies and their power to give anyone financial freedom. Perhaps that is why <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-microstrategy-adopted-bitcoin-and-why-others-will-too\">MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s</a> quote calling Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) “digital gold” resonates with me. </p><p>As an industry still in its nascent stages, I have had my fair share of unfortunate events happen to me, but none as bad as what I’ve experienced with Bitget.

However, I’ve realized that is unfortunately not the case. Crypto exchanges have seen their downfall because of a lack of transparency. FTX is a rather painful example, and it is still fresh in our memories. </p><p>According to reports, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-funds-on-the-move-bankruptcy-proceedings-insider-threat-or-a-hack\">FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried moved up to $10 billion</a> in FTX customer funds (without the knowledge or approval of said customers) to his trading company Alameda Research, whose assets were held primarily in the exchange’s native token, FTX Token (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ftx-token-ftt-price-index\">FTT</a>). Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s announcement that Binance was selling its stake in FTT created panic among customers, which resulted in a bank run and, ultimately, the bankruptcy of the FTX Group. </p><h2>My experience with Bitget</h2><p>I’ve been a user of Bitget for a while now. But in the first quarter of this year, Bitget prevented me from withdrawing my tokens — despite being in full compliance with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/aml-and-kyc-a-catalyst-for-mainstream-crypto-adoption\">Know Your Customer</a> protocols.</p><p>The issue arose in connection with my role in advising a project, ReelStar, beginning in October 2022.</p><p>ReelStar’s announcement about my advisory role was very public. It’s safe to say it was public knowledge. In the same fashion, it was public knowledge that I was going to be paid with the project’s tokens. Unlike what most people — including Bitget executives — might think, I don’t get paid in dollars to promote projects I’m unfamiliar with, unlike celebrities including the Kim Kardashians or Floyd Mayweathers of the world. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/time-for-the-sec-to-settle-with-coinbase-ripple\"><strong><em>It’s time for the SEC to settle with Coinbase and Ripple</em></strong></a></p><p>As such, I only make money when a project’s token grows in value. This is pretty standard, as I am an adviser — not an influencer. I get paid in tokens because I bring more than just influence to the table. I connect projects with partners, bring capital, and ultimately, boost credibility. </p><p>On March 23, it was time for ReelStar’s native token, Reel Token (REELT), to be listed on exchanges. Bitget charged money for this right — six figures, in dollars, just so you have some idea of what happens behind the scenes.</p><p>I had been an adviser on the project for months at that point and was promised compensation in the form of REELT. Having not earned anything for the work I had put in, I sold less than 3% of my personal REELT holdings — less than .03% of the total REELT supply — with the blessings of ReelStar’s founders, Navdeep Sharma and Nick Bahl.</p><p>But my funds — including the Bitcoin and altcoins I already had on the exchange before REELT — were blocked without explanation. I and my attorney, Charles Slamowitz, are now filing suit through my to determine whether Bitget stole my funds, as Bitget is refusing to inform me.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-revolution-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies\"><strong><em>An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</em></strong></a></p><p>At this time, I have no idea where my funds are. As far as I know, Bitget may be using them to make its own investments — and may be planning to keep my money permanently.</p><p>At first, I thought there was an error and that I could clarify things with Bitget — but I soon realized that it had not made a mistake.</p><h2>Is Bitget the next FTX?</h2><p>I lost more than $2 million to the FTX debacle and was invited by <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/crypto-investor-scammed-ftx-made-wrong-decision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fox</a>, CNBC and many others to talk about what I thought went wrong. Now, Bitget is acting in a manner that is arguably reminiscent of FTX<strong> </strong>before its fall. It would be wise for users to consider what that means. I’ve been burned already, and I think I’m in a position to point out the questions surrounding this exchange.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImlHMB3IzVs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I also find it odd that a company like Bitget would hire a former host for a state-owned Chinese television network — <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/authors/gracy-chen\">Gracy Chen</a>, who worked for Phoenix Television — as a key public face for its business. Outside of Chen, we know little about the exchange’s executives. Who are Bitget’s actual owners? Who is on its management team? Who’s controlling the user funds in Bitget’s custody? Few are asking these questions, and the exchange is refusing to provide many answers.</p><p>And in a continuation of its strange hiring practices, it has brought on non-expert celebrities, including actor <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/actor-adam-devine-appears-in-new-bitget-exchange-ad\">Adam DeVine</a> and Lionel Messi, to market its services. This is a dangerous precedent originally set by FTX, and it is worrying. Using celebrities to market cryptocurrency products to unsuspecting members of the public — especially millennials and Gen Z — arguably isn’t ideal for the market. FTX fell, in part, because it relied on influencers and marketing to win over casual users while failing to prioritize hard work on the back end.</p><p>In another parallel with FTX and its reliance on its own FTT token, a substantial portion of Bitget’s reserves are <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">held</a> in its native token, Bitget Token (BGB), rendering the exchange vulnerable if the price of its token falls.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/43eb314f-9b91-49d4-a528-33c99b57e709.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Bitget sabotaging token listings?</h2><p>Recently, GPT Guru <a href=\"https://gptguru.medium.com/how-bitget-insider-job-messed-up-gptg-listing-79d5c7574b82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> Bitget of sabotaging its GPTG token listing on the exchange. According to GPT Guru, GPTG’s listing price was set at $0.0035, but Bitget actually listed it at $0.084 — 24x higher. This led to a huge red candle, which ruined the launch.</p><p>“Upon inquiring more about how it happened, we figured out that it was Bitget’s own team who was responsible for [the] messed up $GPTG listing,” Guru said. “Not only that, the Bitget team itself admitted to GPT Guru’s CEO about an insider job from within the Bitget team.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/33a854b6-13f2-41e5-8aa2-cbb355fac604.jpg\"  /></figure><p>Bitget initially agreed to compensate users who had lost funds, according to GPT Guru, but has since deleted its messages and ceased communication with the GPT Guru team. This led GPT Guru to threaten legal action against Bitget — but not everyone can afford expensive lawyers.</p><p>These actions are unfair and reflect poorly on Bitget as a crypto exchange, which enjoys control over its users’ funds. What’s to stop it from engaging in the same questionable — arguably unethical — behavior in the future? These issues should concern us all. At a time of market uncertainty and looming regulatory action across the globe, we deserve more transparency from the exchanges we use — and clear guarantees of the behavior we can expect.</p><p>The central question for crypto exchanges is what legal duties they specifically owe to their users — if any. My lawsuit is going to find out.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Evan Luthra</strong> is a 28-year-old cryptocurrency entrepreneur who sold his first company, StudySocial, for $1.7 million at 17 and had developed over 30 mobile apps before he was 18.

While it’s hard to imagine a crypto space without social media influencers, they sometimes act unethically by promoting dubious tokens and profiteering at the expense of ordinary investors. Such practices are a matter of concern — not only to the crypto community members who trust them but also to regulators.</p><p>While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission have fined celebrities, including <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kim-kardashian-pays-sec-1-26-million-to-settle-ethereummax-charge\">Kim Kardashian</a>, for failing to disclose their compensation for endorsing certain cryptocurrencies, most cases go unpunished. This lack of oversight deleteriously affects ordinary users.</p><h2>Influencers for hire</h2><p>Consumer trust in influencers has reached unprecedented levels. One survey by Fool <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/research/gen-z-millennial-investors-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">indicated</a> that 91% of Gen Z respondents consider social media their primary source of investing information. Followers copy bloggers, buy what they recommend and follow their financial advice. This widespread practice is acceptable as long as it is accompanied by a transparent endorsement that highlights the influencer’s financial interest in a product.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-faces-lawsuit-influencer-reelstar-token\"><strong><em>Bitget and crypto influencer embroiled in legal saga after Reel Star token listing fiasco</em></strong></a></p><p>In February, the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-issues-warning-to-celebrities-promoting-crypto-amid-latest-enforcement-action\">SEC charged former NBA player Paul Pierce</a> with promoting low-cap tokens to his followers without proper disclosure, resulting in financial losses for the public, with Pierce ultimately settling and paying $1.4 million. Similar investigations <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and music producer DJ Khaled of failing to disclose promotional payments from initial coin offerings, with the latter enthusiastically endorsing one of the projects as a “game changer.” In 2017, Paris Hilton endorsed the alleged scam project LydianCoin without a proper disclaimer, and even used the counter hashtag #ThisIsNotAnAd. Yet another substantial fine was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kim-kardashian-pays-sec-1-26-million-to-settle-ethereummax-charge\">the $1.26 million penalty</a> imposed on Kim Kardashian, whom the SEC accused of failing to transparently reveal her financial stake when she endorsed the EthereumMax (EMAX) token.</p><p>Since Kim Kardashian shilled EthereumMax in June 2021, its value has plummeted by 95%. According to the SEC, she pocketed a $250,000 fee for her endorsement.</p><h2>Our crackdown on a ReelStar influencer</h2><p>There’s a clear pattern involving influencers shilling projects while failing to be transparent about their stake in them. ReelStar is another case in point. One of its endorsers, a cryptocurrency influencer, neglected to transparently communicate with his followers that he had received a substantial commission of 7.5 million tokens from the project he later endorsed. Once it was listed on exchanges — including Bitget — he commenced <a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/en-GB/blog/articles/Addressing-FUD-Bitget-Responds-to-a-Crypto-Influencers-Claims-about-His-Stolen-200000-USD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">selling</a> REELT tokens after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanLuthra/status/1632353280507645953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">stating</a> that he was bullish on the project and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reel_Token/status/1599197395090567168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">expected</a> to see it go “to the moon.” This coincided with a 60% plummet in the token’s value — and many ordinary users left holding the costs. Today, the asset rests approximately 95% below its initial price.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are delighted to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanLuthra?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EvanLuthra</a> on board as we innovate in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Web3</a> space and build the next generation &quot;everything&quot; app!<br><br>Just wait and see what we have coming!

Should a project or an exchange become aware of dubious schemes, they should swerve to prevent history from repeating.</p><p>As a result of this ordeal, Bitget <a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/12560603786789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">covered</a> more than $540,000 in losses that 583 of its users suffered from REELT’s declining price. The ReelStar adviser, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/en-GB/blog/articles/Addressing-FUD-Bitget-Responds-to-a-Crypto-Influencers-Claims-about-His-Stolen-200000-USD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">failed</a> to accept any accountability, instead shifting responsibility to other parties, pretending to be a victim and continuing to mislead his community.</p><p>It’s important to clarify what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior. If an influencer owns a large amount of a new cryptocurrency, participates in its promotion, and sells it off at the first opportunity, without waiting for project development or a price increase, are they acting honestly? No. If other retail investors are aware of this, will they buy this cryptocurrency? Most likely not.</p><p>Insider trading and market manipulation are by no means isolated to social media influencers: Company executives, advisers and partners can be just as guilty. Elon Musk’s tweets are the most famous example of how a few words can spike or plummet a token. His long-standing support of Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) coincided with a rise in its price of 36,000% over two years before it crashed. Celebrity-driven pump-and-dumps aren’t just a question of fiduciary responsibility but also a matter of ethics — there’s what’s legally wrong and what’s morally wrong. </p><h2>Ethics on the crypto playground</h2><p>People trade on Bitget to buy project tokens whose tech, team and roadmap resonate. Similarly, projects seek our platform to secure the impetus for their product’s further development and to deepen available liquidity. However, if their budget is whittled away on influencers whose primary goal is personal enrichment, the funding raised from even the most successful of token sales will swiftly dissipate.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/artificial-intelligence-crypto-your-own-risk\"><strong><em>Don’t be surprised if AI tries to sabotage your crypto</em></strong></a></p><p>Bitget is relied upon by 20 million users, each of whom deserves unwavering respect, transparency and equal access to opportunities coupled with high-quality service. We uphold a policy that places no single user’s interests above those of others. For this reason, we advocate establishing clear disclosure guidelines, improving transparency and educating investors on the risks of crypto trading, as well as the upsides.</p><p>The crypto community as a whole needs to reflect on its values and responsibilities. While hype-driven pumps may benefit a select few in the short term, they undermine credibility and trust in the long run. The path forward should involve maximizing benefits for regular users, not just speculators. Ethical leadership is required to reinforce the industry’s inclusivity while granting it legitimacy in the wider financial sphere.</p><h2>Let’s do better</h2><p>Industry players, together with social media platforms, owe a duty of care to the regular public, who constitute 99.9% of their user base. It is imperative that they guide influencers, reminding them of their responsibilities to the community and the need to comply with the law. This can be achieved through the enactment of dedicated influencer legislation, the issuance of clearer guidelines and codes of conduct, and the deployment of better monitoring tools.</p><p>Trading platforms play a pivotal role in liaising with regulators, identifying suspicious market activity, and safeguarding users from bad actors. Token issuers, meanwhile, should enhance their due diligence processes for influencers, advisers and partners who might misuse their positions for personal gain. Influencers should also seek robust indemnity provisions from brands to cover potential penalties and legal expenses they might incur.</p><p>In instances where misconduct has occurred and users have suffered financial losses, clear mechanisms are needed to initiate asset recovery from the guilty parties. Finally, prospective buyers should do their own research and evaluate potential investments rather than relying on paid endorsements from social media figures. Or, as they say in crypto, DYOR.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Gracy Chen</strong> is the managing director of the crypto derivatives exchange Bitget, and she has emerged as a prominent figure in the crypto derivatives exchange space.

Parallel will only accept borrowed funds if they’ve been loaned by Ledn — it is an exclusive partnership in this sense.”</blockquote><p>According to Reeds, Parallel handles conversion to fiat currency if either a buyer or seller prefers the option over a cryptocurrency payment. Meanwhile, Ledn’s portion of any transaction will be fiat-free, paid in either BTC or United States dollar-backed stablecoins.</p><blockquote>“Parallel is a crypto-centric real estate broker in the Caymans, so users can now finance their purchase of real estate completely fiat-free.” </blockquote><p>It is also possible for cryptocurrency holders to pay for a property with crypto in the Cayman Islands through Parallel. Reeds, however, highlighted a potential draw card in that investors can leverage their BTC holdings as collateral without selling a portion.</p><blockquote>“Then if or when BTC goes up, your loan-to-value ratio goes down, so your house is appreciating, and so is the asset you’re borrowing against.”</blockquote><p>Given that Parallel has previously sold real estate in cryptocurrency-facilitated transfers, Reeds added that both companies have seen demands for the service to finance significant property transactions.</p><p>The real estate firm sold a $10 million property in December 2022, which was <a href=\"https://parallel.ky/parallel-limited-facilitates-the-cayman-islands-second-cryptocurrency-purchase-a-luxury-home-costing-in-excess-of-us10mm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">paid for entirely in cryptocurrency</a>.

Today, these have been supplanted by up-to-the-moment digital trackers. In similar fashion, the crypto industry has blockchain explorers, which offer users real-time tracking of not only their own transactions, but also everything happening on the blockchain.</p> <p>Providing invaluable information for both individuals and companies, blockchain explorers bolster insiders’ argument that cryptocurrencies can be a secure and trustworthy option for investments and digital transactions. Below, 11 members of <a href=\"http://circle.cointelegraph.com/\">Cointelegraph Innovation Circle</a> discuss some of the benefits blockchain explorers offer to all users.</p> <h2>They place all users on an equal footing</h2> <p>Blockchain explorers put all users on an equal footing by allowing each user to access the same information, at their convenience. Decentralized finance must expose numbers so users can independently verify the units of currency exchanged. I’m more interested in using blockchain to send and receive other types of data. Even if the data is encrypted, blockchain explorers can serve the same purpose of asynchronous coordination. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/565d28ae-aad2-4ed9-bc34-a68b9954700e\"> Stephanie So</a>,<a href=\"http://geeq.io\"> Geeq</a></p> <h2>They’re a gateway for transparency </h2> <p>Blockchain explorers are a gateway for transparency and auditability. As an individual, you are able to independently verify what companies are doing as well as their claims. As a company, you can rest assured no one can point fingers at you, claiming foul play. It is a win-win situation, and core to Satoshi’s vision to not trust, but verify. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/16cde551-5395-4ca9-8281-7152cbb88396\"> Tiago Serôdio</a>,<a href=\"https://www.partisiablockchain.com/\"> Partisia Blockchain</a></p> <h2>They allow investors to monitor how startups are using funds</h2> <p>For startups, blockchain explorers are a game-changer. Web3 makes it easy to hold projects accountable after they raise money, because investors can monitor how the projects are spending funds in real time. By allowing the public to directly follow along instead of relying on a few disclosures and audits, it becomes much harder for startup founders to hide suspicious behavior. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/abc0e9e1-b580-49da-b9fb-105caa752b79\"> Wolfgang Rückerl</a>,<a href=\"https://entity.global\"> ENT Technologies AG</a></p> <h2>They give users more power</h2> <p>In the market, some of the top blockchain explorers, like Etherscan, make transactions more transparent, empowering users with information. These explorers let users track funds, access transaction details and interact with smart contracts, giving users more power over their decisions on the blockchain. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/1d9f8b61-2e77-4452-a837-4db4245d01ca\"> Abhishek Singh</a>,<a href=\"http://acknoledger.com/\"> Acknoledger</a></p> <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color: #fabf2c;padding: 20px 30px\">Join the community where you can transform the future.

They verify smart contracts, trace funds and detect suspicious activity. Network metrics and transaction history reveal a blockchain’s health and authenticity to both individuals and companies. These tools promote crypto ecosystem trust, fraud prevention and informed decision making. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/8179044f-5f09-469d-8c72-d17fd6274257\"> Arvin Khamseh</a>,<a href=\"http://soldoutnfts.io\"> SOLDOUT NFTs</a></p> <h2>They can help with the detection and investigation of fraudulent activities</h2> <p>Blockchain explorers offer transparency and a plethora of network information by displaying transaction and block data from a specific chain. Users can view sender and recipient addresses and transaction amounts and track real-time statuses and confirmations. This transparency can help with the detection of fraudulent activities, like wash trading, and provide necessary information for investigations or even compliance audits. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/5cae7f29-8588-4852-bb31-c66fd1d805c6\"> Anthony Georgiades</a>,<a href=\"https://pastel.network/\"> Pastel Network</a></p> <h2>They allow the tracking of any transaction in real time</h2> <p>One of the most crucial insights blockchain explorers provide is transaction transparency. Both individuals and companies can track any transaction on the network in real time. This transparency enhances trust, allows for auditing and helps users monitor for fraudulent activities, contributing to a more secure environment. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/0d167285-44f8-41a6-9001-72aab6b4058d\"> Tomer Warschauer Nuni</a>,<a href=\"http://www.kryptomon.co\"> Kryptomon</a></p> <h2>They can help users validate the authenticity of a project</h2> <p>If you look at a blockchain explorer, it won’t tell you who owns “Wallet # 0x1234abcd.” However, if you see that too many transfers are occurring between a contract address and that wallet (or a particular set of wallets), you will begin to wonder if people are actually supporting the project, or if it’s just a few people trying to make some activity appear on the chain. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/008ee5ae-3d26-4c82-a558-db3e57e4c769\"> Zain Jaffer</a>,<a href=\"http://www.zain-ventures.com\"> Zain Ventures</a></p> <h2>They provide detailed transaction diagnostics</h2> <p>Despite the common misconception that crypto is anonymous, blockchain explorers provide detailed diagnostics for participants to verify any transaction that has occurred on a network. Combined, the data offers a picture of how value is being stored and transferred among its users. Viewed by the right eyes, these tools reveal the inner workings of key infrastructure and the overall health of a chain. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/83c71aad-8be6-470a-aaf9-7f146821217c\"> Oleksandr Lutskevych</a>,<a href=\"http://cex.io\"> CEX.IO</a></p> <h2>They help decision makers capitalize on emerging markets</h2> <p>Blockchain explorers provide real-time transaction insights and deliver crypto credibility. For instance, a company might spot a surge in transactions for a specific cryptocurrency. By examining the associated addresses, it can identify a new online marketplace that’s accepting that cryptocurrency, indicating growth and potential partnerships. This helps decision makers adapt their strategies and capitalize on emerging markets. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/a27b7ccb-dfb8-468f-83ae-4aac596f0a40\"> Vinita Rathi</a>,<a href=\"https://www.systango.com\"> Systango</a></p> <h2>They’re useful tools for conducting due diligence</h2> <p>Blockchain explorers can be dependable tools for conducting due diligence if you have a keen eye. The proof is in the pudding for a Web3 project, which can promote or shill all it wants. We can use blockchain explorers to verify online claims and watch for potentially fraudulent activity, as they follow every transaction on the network in real time. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/bcb46b42-12ad-4937-8069-b741c596ef3c\"> Sheraz Ahmed</a>,<a href=\"http://storm.partners/\"> STORM Partners</a></p> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> <p><em>This article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

    "description": "\n                        <p class=\"s5\">As Bitcoin's (BTC) momentum seems to be waning, the eyes of the crypto world are shifting towards a new potential powerhouse - Everlodge (ELDG). Currently in its presale phase, Everlodge has quickly garnered attention with predictions of an unprecedented 100x surge. Let's take a closer look at why this new project is so promising.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>\nEverlodge (ELDG): Redefining Real Estate Investments\n<p class=\"s5\">Everlodge harnesses the power of blockchain to offer fractional ownership in luxury properties. The ability to own a slice of a $9 million New York penthouse, starting with just a $100 investment, has been a game-changer in the investment narrative.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Everlodge isn't merely about trading tokens; it's a holistic ecosystem. By digitizing property details into NFTs, Everlodge ensures transparency, security, and ease of trade. Each token represents a genuine stake in a tangible property, allowing for both the appreciation of real estate and the advantages of crypto trading.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The Launchpad feature of Everlodge acts as a bridge between property developers and investors. Now, developers can directly source funds from the community, and in return, investors get early-bird access to high-value real estate projects.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Moreover, the Rewards Club introduces a novel concept where investors can earn and enjoy stays in luxury properties or even flip their nights for additional revenue. This mix of luxury experience with investment returns has made Everlodge an irresistible proposition.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">While Bitcoin has solidified its reputation based on being digital gold, Everlodge's approach of combining the trillion-dollar real estate market with the agility of blockchain presents a unique and compelling investment narrative.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Bitcoin will undoubtedly continue its reign, but Everlodge's ascent is a clear testament to the ever-evolving benefit of blockchain technology. Analysts are predicting that the early-bird presale price of $0.010 could rise to $1.00 as Everlodge launches globally.</p>\n<p>Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG)</p>\nBitcoin (BTC): The Impending Decision on Bitcoin ETF in 2024\n<p class=\"s5\">Bitcoin's inherent volatility has always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers traders an opportunity to capitalize on price swings; on the other, it can erode significant value in short periods. The oscillation between $24,800 and $31,000 within a week stands a testament to Bitcoin's unpredictable nature.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The hope for a Bitcoin ETF had ignited a significant amount of optimism. The prospect of regulatory approval for such a fund could potentially bring in a new wave of institutional investors, translating to higher liquidity and increased acceptance for the crypto giant.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Yet, despite this enthusiasm, Bitcoin's inability to break the $31,800 resistance zone highlights caution from the market. Gary Gensler's comments serve as a poignant reminder of the regulatory uncertainties that continue to surround cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Bitcoin's precarious position near the $27,500 support level adds another layer of uncertainty. If this level is breached, a potential cascade effect could push Bitcoin down toward the psychological barrier of $20,000. This bearish sentiment is further compounded by technical indicators suggesting a potential trend reversal on the horizon.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Most analysts are agreeing that future price performance depends on whether the ETF is approved or not. The latest news suggests that there is a delay, with a final decision being made in early 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">With Bitcoin unlikely to move upward until this date, the crypto community is flocking to the Everlodge presale to grab the last remaining tokens during phase 1 of the presale. Time is of the essence as Everlodge is expected to surge 100x from this level.</p>\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n<p class=\"s14\">Website: https://www.everlodge.io/</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Telegram: https://t.me/everlodge</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "Algorand native token, ALGO, has experienced a dramatic plunge in the wake of the recent crash in the cryptocurrency market. On August 19, the token&#8217;s value plummeted by a staggering 18%, hitting a low of $0.082.  While ALGO subsequently rebounded slightly, currently trading at $0.097 according to CoinGecko, the prevailing sentiment suggests that the selling pressure is something investors must keep an eye on. The 24-hour gains have been a mere 0.9%, and over the span of the past week, ALGO has suffered a 5.3% decline. ALGO price action today. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Optimism Reverses From Range Low With 10% Gain – How Far Can Bulls Go? Algorand Challenges Amidst Brief Rebound Despite the transient recovery in prices, the persistent selling pressure continues to cast a shadow over ALGO&#8217;s future prospects. The potential consequence of this is the looming possibility of ALGO establishing a new all-time low in the days to come.  This setback is compounded by a development earlier in the year when the US Securities and Exchange Commission designated ALGO as a security. This action was made as the SEC unleashed regulatory measures against the US-based crypto exchange, Bittrex.  The reclassification of ALGO has set in motion a cascade of ramifications, affecting both the token itself and its holders in terms of financial regulations. Regulatory Uncertainty And Value Erosion In spite of vigorous resistance from its Foundation, ALGO&#8217;s demand has experienced a decline. The overarching reason behind this decline lies in the hesitancy of investors towards assets entangled in regulatory ambiguity. Consequently, the value of the token has witnessed a staggering decline of over 87% since the SEC&#8217;s classification.  ALGO hits a market cap of $765 million today. Chart: TradingView.com Over the past three months, ALGO has endured a series of successive all-time lows (ATLs). The downward spiral began on June 10, culminating in the most recent ATL on August 17. The token&#8217;s efforts to stage a bullish rebound were quashed by the overwhelming weight of relentless selling pressure. Critical Support And Prospective Scenarios Meanwhile, the pivotal $0.09 support level has managed to alleviate some of the selling pressure, although indicators on the trading charts raise concerns about its sustainability. Should the critical support of $0.09 crumble under the pressure, it opens the gates for short sellers to target the price range of $0.05 to $0.07, potentially setting another unfortunate precedent of a new low for ALGO. ALGO seven-day price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap However, if the current support level holds, prospective buyers can anticipate opportunities to secure profits within the range of $0.12 to $0.14. As ALGO navigates through these tumultuous waters, market observers are keenly watching how it will weather the storm. The complex interplay of regulatory challenges and market sentiment will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of this token in the days ahead.
