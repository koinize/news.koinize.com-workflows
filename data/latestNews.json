The exchange does not have external insurance for its users; however, it does operate a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/keeping-your-crypto-safe-insights-from-bitget-on-how-to-achieve-growth-throughout-crypto-winter\">$300 million User Protection Fund</a> that executives claim functions better than third-party insurance:</p><blockquote>“This enables us to efficiently cover users’ assets without depending on external bureaucracy or policy changes.“</blockquote><p>Though not yet a regulatory requirement, Bitget seeks to increase the number of partnerships with third-party auditors to examine its assets and reserves. The exchange updates its proof-of-reserves every month.</p><p>While proof-of-reserves has become popular as means of disseminating information on exchange assets in the aftermath of cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse, experts have cautioned on its effectiveness. Jack Graves, professor of law at Syracuse University, previously warned that “you can audit how many assets a crypto exchange has on-chain, but how much of it is pledged as collateral?
