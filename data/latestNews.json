He warned that for any form of price manipulation, be it the price of exchange-listed securities, penny stock securities or crypto-securities, the same anti-fraud rules apply and the days of such social media influencers are numbered.</p><p>The former SEC chief drew attention to the brazen and arrogant way in which so many social media influencers grift their victims. Most of these shilling and price manipulation occur via social media platforms such as Twitter, Discord, Instagram or Reddit. Stark noted that the nature of securities fraud makes it easier to detect and prosecute unlike other forms of fraud where the perpetrator often tries to hide behind their identity.</p><blockquote>“Regulators and law enforcement need only turn on their computers to discover an extraordinary and resplendent evidentiary trail of compelling and vivid inculpatory evidence. Indeed, far from tying the government's hands, social media has become the virtual rope that many crypto bros (and sisters) use to hang themselves.” Stark explained.</blockquote><p>Stark went on to cite the example of Francis Sabo, a notorious crypto influencer, who was <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2023/lr25736.htm?utm_source=securitiesdocket.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=sec-sues-influencer-in-100-million-stock-manipulation-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">charged </a>in a $100 million security fraud case and used social media platforms to manipulate exchange-traded stocks.</p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multiple-silvergate-lawsuits-over-alleged-ftx-ties-combined-by-judge\"><strong><em>Multiple Silvergate lawsuits over alleged FTX ties combined by judge</em></strong></a></p><p>Apart from Sabo, there have been numerous instances of crypto influencers found to be in violation of securities law.
