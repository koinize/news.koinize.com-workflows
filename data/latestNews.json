    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/gemini-files-court-statement-accusing-digital-currency-group-of-fraudulent-actions/",
    "description": "In a Friday 15 court filing, Gemini, the US-based crypto exchange platform, has accused Digital Currency Group (DCG) of engaging in “fraudulent activities” and attempting to evade responsibility for the harm caused to creditors.  The filing directly responds to a statement made by DCG regarding a proposed agreement between DCG, the debtors, and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. Related Reading: Artist Stages Crypto Protest In Front Of US SEC With “Rug Pull” Exhibit Gemini Seeks Justice For Creditors Affected By The Collapse Of Genesis According to Gemini, DCG devised a $1.1 billion promissory note to conceal the significant financial losses caused by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC).  However, DCG allegedly kept the actual terms of the note “hidden,” leading to misleading representations to Gemini’s creditors. Furthermore, the company claims that DCG borrowed a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) from the company instead of providing much-needed capital. Gemini also highlights that DCG is now unwilling to repay the more than $630 million it borrowed from the company, which was due several months ago in May.  In response, as reported by NewsBTC, DCG has proposed a deal that would require Genesis creditors, including Gemini, to extend years of credit to DCG. However, Gemini intends to fight against this proposal, asserting that DCG should pay creditors a just and adequate amount. Gemini argues that DCG has attempted to “wear down” creditors over the past ten months, hoping they would settle for a significant reduction in the amount owed.  According to the court filing, Gemini is determined not to succumb to these tactics and will continue to pursue a fair resolution. Rejection Of DCG&#8217;s Proposed Recovery Rates In the filing, Gemini criticizes DCG&#8217;s proposed recovery rates, claiming they are “misleading and deceptive.” The company argues that receiving fractional shares of interest and principal payments over seven years from a risky counterparty is not equivalent to receiving the actual cash and digital assets owned by Genesis.  Gemini demands that DCG significantly improve the terms of the loans it provides if it wishes to gain the support of the harmed individuals. Overall, Gemini accuses DCG of being the architect of its subsidiary&#8217;s insolvency and “sacrificing” the exchange and its creditors to shield itself from liability.  The company founded by the Winklevoss twins asserts that DCG&#8217;s delay tactics have hindered progress in distributing funds to Gemini Lenders, despite Gemini&#8217;s offer of a $100 million premium for a swift resolution.  Related Reading: These Countries Are Picking Shiba Inu Over Dogecoin And Cardano It is worth noting that the court filing by Gemini comes after months of negotiations with the crypto lender and DCG and the collapse of the Gemini Earn program, which resulted in lawsuits and severed ties between Digital Currency Group and the crypto exchange.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"
