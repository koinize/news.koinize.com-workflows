    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-upside-momentum-fall/",
    "description": "Amidst widespread bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, one analyst on X thinks the leg up won&#8217;t be as strong as it was in the past few weeks. Pointing to developments in the Bitcoin log curves, the analyst expects the coin to find resistance as it attempts to break higher.  Bitcoin Uptrend To Slow Down The analyst doubts the current excitement around the uptrend, and technical formations advise the contrarian view. Many in the industry think Bitcoin will not only ease past $70,000, a round number nearly tested this week, but also float to $100,000 in the next few weeks.  On X, the analyst remains confident about the coin&#8217;s prospects. However, based on the Bitcoin log curve assessment, the leg up will likely be labored. The analyst compares the current price formations with the Bitcoin log curves. In 2021, the tool was used to identify price peaks. Based on price formation, the analyst notes that if BTC peaks in 2024, then prices will likely turn around from between $77,000 and $149,000. These prospective peaks&#8217; upper and lower bands represent layers 5 and 7 of the log curve. Related Reading: BNB Price Zooms 10%, Here Are Next Possible Barriers For Bulls Even with BTC possibly rising to $149,000, at least from the tool, the Layer 7 target is relatively lower. By factoring in a one-year slowdown in growth, the predicted peak is revised downwards from $180,000 to $149,000. When writing, the &#8220;red band&#8221; of the log curve has been breached earlier than usual. Looking back, Bitcoin prices tend to peak three months after this breakout.  That likely places Bitcoin&#8217;s peak at around the $77,000 level but below $100,000. Nonetheless, this is hard to predict, considering the volatile nature of prices and the dynamic nature of fundamental factors. The community remains optimistic about what lies ahead. So far, Bitcoin prices have been trending at historical highs, but there has been a sharp drop in the momentum of upside. BTC Bears In A Commanding Position The daily chart shows that prices are still inside the bear bar of March 5. The candlestick had a high trading volume and was wide-ranging. For the uptrend to be valid, prices must break above $70,000, based on rising trading volume.
