Using an app called YAK, tourists can check in at various locations around the country and in return receive a travel NFT. </p><p>PokemonGo for backpackers and passport stamp addicts sounds appealing. The reality is a bit more frustrating.</p><p>Crypto folk wont like how much personal info you have to put in to get set up.

While the MahaNakhon NFT was obtained without fuss, I somehow acquired an NFT for Pattaya City and Phuket, even though I didn’t go to either.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-2370.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20549\" width=\"-217\" height=\"-214\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-2370.jpg 827w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-2370-300x297.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-2370-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-2370-770x763.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 827px) 100vw, 827px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Amazing Thailand NFT. Source: Amazing Thailand/YAK App</figcaption></figure><p>The idea is that you earn while travelling by getting discounts depending on how many NFTs you get. In many cases, getting the offer seems to require buying something else such as getting two free pieces of chicken if you spend over 1,000 Thai baht ($29) in a restaurant  a tall order in a country where you can have a nice meal for a fifth of that.</p><p>In fact, many of the offers didnt seem to be exclusive to the NFT app at all and were applicable without the app.</p><p>Now, apparently  though it didnt say so on the poster  the game was only supposed to run until the end of April so maybe all the good offers were gone, I cant be sure. </p><p>But for me the biggest question was how to get the NFTs out of the app. They seem to be on a native chain of Thailand-based cryptocurrency platform Bitkub. As far as I could tell, it required creating Bitkub account to move them, which in turn required a Thai phone number to receive the one time passcode.</p><p>Overall it needed a bit of tweaking but I liked the concept of being able to collect POAPs for places Ive visited as a tourist. The discounts were lousy but not really necessary: if you actually got the NFT corresponding to the place you visited, collecting for the sake of collecting would have been enough.</p><p>A revamped, global version would be nice please.</p><h2>Other stuff</h2><p> Gods Unchained unveiled a <a href=\"https://blog.godsunchained.com/2023/05/23/gods-unchained-new-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >new roadmap</a> on May 23.
