It's at $25,650 (Bitstamp) or $24,750 (Binance). The conclusion is, you don't want to drop beneath that level and you'd preferably want to mimic 2015-2016 sideways period,” he wrote in part of an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1696090930682475003/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">X post</a>. </p><blockquote>“If the 200-Week EMA sustains, conclusions are that we're bottoming out here and we are potentially getting a massive entry point. If it's lost, I'd be looking at a case of $19,500-21,500 as the next big entry point and final capitulation. On the lower timeframes and over the week, it's still possible to sweep below the 200-Week EMA. As long as we don't lose the level.”</blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/77cdc14b-3708-4a91-8279-252b3a8ba05d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X</em></figcaption></figure><p>Van de Poppe continued that order book liquidity “most likely” resided below the 200 EMA.</p><p>“In that regard, a sweep of that area is the most likely outcome,” he wrote. </p><blockquote>“Two strategies can be deployed: 1 - Sweep at $25,750 for an aggressive long entry towards the other side of the range (entry can only be taken after the sweep and when $25,750 is reclaimed). 2 - Sweep of $25,200 towards $24,700-25,000 (the 200-Week EMA on Binance) and bullish divergences on higher timeframes. That's the golden trade and could be the start of a reversal. However, $25,750 should be reclaimed in the bounce, otherwise this trade could be invalid/stopped out.”</blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/d126ec2a-8785-4d57-a2df-ba6f530870d3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD annotated chart.
