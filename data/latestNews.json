In turnkey Bitcoin mining, users can buy an assembled, configured, and optimized Bitcoin mining rig to use on mining farms.</p><p>The facilities will host over 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s, which are expected to add about 1 exahash per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark’s hashrate after the deal. According to Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, the newly acquired infrastructure will enable the company to reach its target of 16EH/s by the end of the year.</p><p>The purchase follows several acquisitions by CleanSpark in recent months, despite a slump in BTC mining profitability during the bear market. In April, the company announced the purchase of 45,000 <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-purchases-45-000-asics-for-145m\">Antminer S19 XP rigs for $144.9 million</a>, which is expected to add 6.4 EH/s of mining power. </p><p>In February, CleanSpark <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cleanspark-boosts-computing-power-by-37-with-thousands-of-new-bitmain-rigs\">added 20,000 new Antminer S19j Pro+ units</a> to its portfolio for $43.6 million, expected to bring 2.44 EH/s to its computing power. A few weeks earlier, the company announced a $16-million expansion at its Georgia facility with 15,000 new rigs. </p><p>The ongoing expansion overlooks the declining profitability of Bitcoin mining, which has dropped to $0.066 per TH/s per day at the time of writing, down from its $0.40 peak in June 2019, <a href=\"https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to data from Hashrate Index.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/0494ca82-c93b-4428-b51d-dc7ba39c656c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin Hashprice over the past year.

The next halving will reduce Bitcoin block rewards to 3.125 BTC. </p><p>Bitcoin's price has historically spiked post-halvings thanks to a cut in the cryptocurrency's supply as demand remained steady. “We continue to make use of opportunities created by current market conditions to prepare for next year’s bitcoin halving,” CleanSpark CFO Gary Vecchiarelli said.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-breaks-above-30000-is-the-bull-run-back-on/",
    "description": "Bitcoin price is back above $30,000 for the second time in 2023, with bulls hoping it not only holds this time, but leads to renewed confidence in the crypto market. Is this a sign the bear market is over and the bull run is back on? Or is this just a bear market rally that will result in new lows eventually? Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the latest price action. Bitcoin Price Reclaims $30,000 Following Shift In News Cycle Just a week ago, the SEC was waging a war against altcoins, and there was negative news around every turn for the crypto market. In a flash, the news cycle turned positive with a slew of Wall Street brands making their presence known in the crypto space. Names include BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, and others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out Of Ichimoku Cloud, Storms Toward $28,000 Within days of the news making rounds, Bitcoin price is already back above $30,000 per coin, leaving bears who expected new lows bewildered and in disbelief. Bitcoin has reclaimed $30,000 &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why $31,000 Is The Level To Watch With $30K Broken Not only is BTCUSD back above $30,000 per coin, but it is already quickly approaching $31,000. A higher high on any timeframe could send further confirmation to investors that a bottom is in for cryptocurrencies. Investors and traders who were too fearful to buy lower might finally see these levels as a safer entry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge But Bitcoin isn&#8217;t yet out of the woods. $31,000 is the current local high for 2023, and that level must be taken out to further confirm an uptrend. An uptrend, by definition, is a series of higher highs and higher lows. With a higher low made at precisely $25,000 – the only thing that is missing is this higher high above $31,000.
