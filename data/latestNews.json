The loan was to be repaid within six months. However, Mr. Gang defaulted on the loan, leading Mr. Ming to sue his counterparty in court. </p><p>In its landmark decision this week, the Nanchang People’s Court stated Mr. Ming was required to prove that Tether is a legally issued fiat currency to bring a necessary cause of action for judicial relief, citing a series of legislation <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/possession-of-bitcoin-still-legal-in-china-despite-the-ban-lawyer-says\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/possession-of-bitcoin-still-legal-in-china-despite-the-ban-lawyer-says/amp\">forming China’s crypto ban</a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/possession-of-bitcoin-still-legal-in-china-despite-the-ban-lawyer-says\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/possession-of-bitcoin-still-legal-in-china-despite-the-ban-lawyer-says/amp\"></a>. Since Mr. Ming could not do so, the court ruled that the lawsuit did not fall within the appropriate scope of civil litigation. Mr. Ming subsequently appealed the decision, which was also dismissed. The presiding judge wrote:</p><blockquote>“There are legal risks involved in participating in virtual currency investment and trading activities. If any legal person, unincorporated organization, or natural person invests in virtual currencies and related derivatives that violate public order and good customs, the relevant civil legal actions will be invalid, and the resulting losses shall be borne by them.“</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies have been banned in China since late 2021 over environmental concerns and a lack of surveillance. In another ruling from August, the Changzhou Zhonglu People’s Court <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinas-risky-bitcoin-court-decision-is-huobi-in-trouble-or-not-asia-express/\">invalidated a $10 million</a> Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) lending agreement, ruling that the lender had no means of judicial relief due to the borrower’s default, as crypto is a prohibited activity within the country. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/6-questions-for-jw-verret-an-attorney-whos-tracking-the-money-but-advocating-for-crypto/\">6 Questions for JW Verret — the blockchain professor who’s tracking the money</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-1-35-billion-btc/",
    "description": "A new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytical firm, has buttressed recent data indicating Bitcoin holders are adding to their holdings. These long-term Bitcoin investors, often known as &#8220;HODLers,&#8221; don&#8217;t appear to be phased by the recent volatility in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.  According to on-chain data, long-term holders have been rapidly amassing Bitcoin, adding more than 50,000 BTC each month to their holdings. Monthly Accumulation Of BTC Worth $1.35 Billion Bitcoin is currently showing signs of slowing down, as its price just dipped below $27,000. It would appear that short-term speculators are mostly to blame for the persistent selling pressure, as data shows whale investors are seeing this opportunity to buy more BTC at a discount rather than secure profits.  According to Glassnode&#8217;s HODLer Net Position Change metric, long-term holders are purchasing an average of 50,000 BTC worth $1.35 billion at the current price of Bitcoin every month. Another metric, the Long-Term Holder Supply, which measures the amount of BTC&#8217;s market cap with holders, also reached an all-time high of 14.859 million BTC. This means 76.1% of the total circulating supply has not moved in the past five months. Consequently, 94.8% of the total Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past month. Source: Glassnode To back up this data of increased accumulation, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared chart data from Santiment showing Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million.  At this rate, the number of BTC vaulted by holders is poised to pass 50,000 in October. This increased accumulation suggests that long-term holders remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and see this price correction as temporary. #Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 $BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million! pic.twitter.com/47ZePiaIII — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023 BTC price falls below $27,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Supply Tightens According to Glassnode, only 11.5% of BTC&#8217;s circulating supply changed hands in the last 3 months, indicating a prolonged inactive period of on-chain activity. That there are fewer transactions suggests that investors are unwilling to sell at the current price as the industry awaits approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.  Source: Glassnode If this current trend holds, then the current downtrend could be short-lived, especially if sentiment among smaller traders also turns toward buying. A predominantly hold mentality would give the asset time to recover and establish significant support that serves as a bounce-off point for another rally. Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,766 and is down by 1.31% in a 24-hour timeframe as it approaches the next major support near the $26,500 level. If enough large players accumulate at these lower prices, it may establish a price floor as bulls push the price back up. As crypto analyst James Straten points out, Bitcoin could jump 50% as part of the correlation between the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the price of BTC.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/buy-link-chainlink-safest-bet-for-mega-trend/",
    "description": "Real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as one of the next mega trends in the crypto space, and according to a recent study by K33 Research, Chainlink could profit in a big way from this trend. In a recent study, the research firm projected that LINK would be the &#8220;safest bet&#8221; to capitalize on this impending boom. This sentiment reflects the broader industry outlook, especially given BlackRock CEO Larry Fink&#8217;s earlier comments in May where he noted the potential of tokenization in securities. &#8220;The next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities,&#8221; remarked Larry Fink during a New York Times DealBook event. He further elucidated that tokenization, which is the creation of a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain, would facilitate &#8220;instantaneous settlement&#8221; and notably reduce transactional fees. What Makes Chainlink The Go-To Choice? The growing interest in the tokenization of RWAs, which includes traditional financial instruments like private equity, credit, and bonds, has paved the way for the increasing valuation of LINK. Tokenization is no longer a buzzword but a mechanism to optimize financial transactions by reducing costs, streamlining operations, and enhancing transparency and accessibility. Related Reading: Chainlink To Go “Parabolic” After Breaking 28-Month Downtrend? David Zimmerman, an analyst at K33 Research, mentioned, “If we wish to have exposure to the RWA narrative and avoid being sidelined when it takes off, LINK is the safest bet.&#8221; Global financial institutions and emerging cryptocurrency platforms are gearing up to leverage this trend. A testament to this is JPMorgan&#8217;s recent announcement about its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction, which involved industry giants BlackRock and Barclays. Chainlink, as a project, has strategically positioned itself in this domain, acting as a bridge between blockchains and the external world. The project’s unique system of oracles and an expansive list of partnerships emphasize its pivotal role. &#8220;Chainlink, with its system of oracles and wide partnerships, is well-positioned to connect blockchains with real-world data, making it a strong player in the RWA narrative,&#8221; stated renowned crypto analyst Scott Melker, echoing Zimmerman&#8217;s insights. Zimmerman further opined that while Chainlink might not record the highest gains in this RWA movement, its robust infrastructure and pivotal role in the ecosystem make it one of the most well-placed projects to harness the potential benefits. Related Reading: Chainlink Creator Expects Mass Crypto Adoption To Send Market Cap To $10 Trillion Despite the undeniable potential and traction that RWAs have gained, Zimmerman highlighted potential challenges in realizing their full potential. Yet, the prevailing narrative&#8217;s allure is so compelling that we might witness &#8220;an isolated RWA crypto bubble&#8221; even before its tangible real-world impacts become ubiquitous. Zimmerman&#8217;s advice to potential investors is to be patient. The recommendation is to wait for the token to hit the long-term support level of around $5.70 before diving into long positions. LINK Price Remains Trapped In Trend Channel The Chainlink price has been trading within a descending trend channel since June last year. Even the recent hype around the partnership with Swift and the SmartCon was not enough to push LINK out of the trend channel. In total, LINK has been rejected at the upper trendline six times, last on October 1. A bullish sign at the moment is that Chainlink is holding above the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $7.19 despite the sharp correction in the broader crypto market. If this holds over the next few days, LINK could attempt a retest towards the upper resistance line. If the support breaks, K33 Research&#8217;s scenario could come true and Chainlink could fall below the $6 price again. Thus, the support is instrumental in determining whether Chainlink is currently a buy or sell. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
