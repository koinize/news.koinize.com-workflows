Speaking to Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall at <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-bitcoin-ardoino-ai-would-only-choose-bitcoin-tether-cto\">Plan B Summer School</a>, the Argentinian Bitcoin proponent recalled highs and lows of the journey across nearly a dozen European nations.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/7381ccaf-3052-4225-ad37-326acbca1e5b.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">\"Bitcoin is work. Bitcoin is time. Bitcoin is hope.\" La Bitcoineta parked at the Plan B Summer School in Lugano in 2023.</figcaption></figure><p>A portion of La Bitcoineta’s journey took the van from Serbia to Lugano, which involved a border transition between Bosnia and Croatia. Aguilar had waited until midnight to cross the border, which prompted suspicion from border and customs officials.</p><p>After an initial check at the border, the van was stopped ten minutes later by an unmarked vehicle manned by five officials in civilian clothes. The Bitcoin enthusiast said:</p><blockquote>“They said 'we are the police, we have to search your vehicle.' I thought it's most likely that they thought we were smuggling people.”</blockquote><p>Again Aguilar was cleared to continue his trip to Lugano, humorously noting that he had avoided ‘bribing’ an official who had discovered Aguilar’s copy of The Bitcoin Standard, a book written by BTC proponent and economist Saifedean Ammous:</p><blockquote>“I didn't know if he wanted it, but just in case it was seen as a bribe, I did not give it as a gift.”</blockquote><p>Other sections of the journey have produced more positive experiences. Aguilar highlighted seeing thumbs up signs from strangers in Switzerland at the sight of La Bitcoineta cruising past. Meanwhile people in crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Spain and Portugal were seemingly oblivious to the van’s presence.</p><p>La Bitcoineta has travelled from from Spain to Gibraltar, Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland, Munich, Prague, Oslo, Romania, Serbia and Lugano.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockstream-ceo-adam-back-venture-capital-s-ico-gambits-left-bitcoin-ecosystem-underfunded\"><strong><em>Related: Venture capital’s ICO gambits left Bitcoin ecosystem underfunded — Adam Back</em></strong></a></p><p>The journey is set to continue in the direction of Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia. A trip to the United Kingdom is planned in September, before heading to Madrid, Amsterdam and Luana before completing the journey in Lugano.</p><p>Aguilar said next year’s tour might feature longer trips to different countries, gauging the different level of Bitcoin adoption. </p><blockquote>“Let's say we do Germany, we do France. The idea is to interview a French Bitcoiner to see that he's not a shit coiner, right? If he's a really Bitcoiner.”</blockquote><p>This would involve allowing Bitcoin advocates in different countries to be involved in La Bitcoineta talks and presentations on the subject.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And alas <br><br>A new meme template was born <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BiRhCiheHN\">pic.twitter.com/BiRhCiheHN</a></p>&mdash; RŌNIN (@ronin21btc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronin21btc/status/1667524286469349376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The van has seen its fair share of fan fare as well. La Bitcoineta birthed a famous meme with Bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, after Aguilar gave the MicroStrategy CEO a tour of the van at a conference:</p><blockquote>“He loved it, especially for the big ‘Bitcoin is hope’ phrase on the side of the van. He took a picture and uploaded it to his Instagram.”</blockquote><p>As for the photo, Aguilar says his cameraman was the source of Saylor’s meme-worthy expression:</p><blockquote>“He was filming instead of taking photos so he was taking too long and that's when Saylor he got the angry look that the meme has.” </blockquote><p>La Bitcoineta is also covered in signatures from influential Bitcoin figures like Adam Back, Ammous, Prince Philip of Serbia, Jack Mallers, Elizabeth Stark and other “OG Bitcoiners” that have left messages for posterity on the van.</p><p><em>The interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about what it’s like to attend a Bitcoin School.

    "description": "<p>The latest statement from the Uniswap Foundation has claimed that the launch of version 4 of the protocol depends on Ethereum&rsquo;s upcoming Cancun upgrade.&nbsp;</p>\nCancun, Audit, Then V4\n<p>The Uniswap Foundation recently put forth an announcement elaborating its plans for the much-awaited Uniswap v4 protocol. Although the foundation&rsquo;s Governance Lead, Erin Koen, has disclosed that the launch is scheduled for later this year, the fact is that a lot depends on the successful deployment of Ethereum&rsquo;s upcoming Cancun upgrade, which is scheduled to go live around the end of September.</p>\n<p>Uniswap v4 will also require thorough auditing before it goes live, a process that can only start after Cancun and can take as long as one to four months.&nbsp;</p>\nV4 To Reinvent Uniswap\n<p>The v4 launch will bring forth a major reinvention for the Uniswap platform, which is already the largest decentralized exchange protocol. One of the most noteworthy changes that will be incorporated will be &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; or smart contracts that can enable additional customization of the protocol&rsquo;s liquidity pools to create a more modular exchange structure through features like dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and tailored on-chain oracles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another revolutionary feature that is to be incorporated with the v4 launch is a &ldquo;flash accounting&rdquo; system, which will reduce fees for liquidity providers and is being predicted to contribute significantly to gas savings. This mechanism leverages \"transient storage,\" which will be activated by the proposed EIP-1153 change in Ethereum's protocol, set to be integrated during Cancun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, in contrast to the v3 model, which involved transferring assets into and out of pools after each swap, the new method will only transfer net balances.</p>\nRoadmap For V4\n<p>For now, the next &ldquo;protocol code frozen&rdquo; stage will focus on incorporating the EIP-1153 into the protocol code for the next version. Ideally, the EIP-1153 will be successfully integrated into Etheruem&rsquo;s Cancun upgrade, which will allow the Uniswap Foundation to roll out the v4 protocol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Koen has claimed that the foundation will not be rushing the process and instead take the necessary time to do due diligence and ensure the integrity of the Uniswap ecosystem and user safety. Therefore v4 launch will only go ahead after the necessary parameters are satisfied.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the upcoming Cancun upgrade, fueling even more excitement for the potential advancements in the next version of Uniswap. This pivotal moment holds great significance for the DeFi space, as these developments have the potential to reshape the industry and reinvent decentralized exchanges.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-will-bitcoin-rocket-to-the-moon-price-analysis/",
    "description": "In the Bitcoin space, one question echoes persistently through the minds of enthusiasts and investors alike: When will Bitcoin rocket to the moon? While no one knows the answer, there are on-chain metrics and historical patterns that can be followed to track down the answer. Bitcoin Price Analysis: When Will BTC Break Out? Over the last two weeks, the Bitcoin price has been in a sideways trend. After the Bitcoin bulls were able to turn the tide at $24,900, the price has risen by more than 25%. Since then, however, BTC has been trading in the range between $29.800 and $31.300. Neither bulls nor bears have been able to gain the upper hand and break out of the trading range in higher time frames. The renowned crypto trader and analyst “Rekt Capital” believes that all it takes is a positive catalyst to current BTC price action. According to him, Bitcoin&#8217;s current sideways trend within a tight range is a mere step away from its ultimate demise. He affirms that “a BTC downtrend is only ever one positive catalyst away from ending. And a BTC uptrend is always one negative catalyst from ending”, adding: BTC has performed a bullish Monthly close but is primed for a healthy technical retest at ~$29250. With price currently around $30200… I wonder what negative catalyst will soon emerge to facilitate this technical retest. On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr echoes this view and points to BTC total transfer volume as indicator for a massive breakout move. While the exact timing remains elusive, Adler Jr suggests that the moonshot could be triggered by a significant event such as the approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Supply Peaks As Institutional Investors Show Increased Involvement Drawing from historical evidence, Adler Jr highlights the correlation between explosive price pumps and a surge in BTC&#8217;s total transfer volume. Past instances, like the dramatic surges witnessed in February 2019 and August 2020, lend weight to the argument that a similar surge may loom just around the corner. Bulls Vs. Bears And Whale Games Daan Crypto Trades remarks on the current state of the market, &#8220;They call this candlestick pattern: Thanks for your stops.&#8221; Daan&#8217;s keen eye eagerly awaits a decisive breakthrough that will propel Bitcoin into a significant move. Related Reading: Glassnode Co-Founder Predicts Bull Run For Bitcoin Amidst Sideways Trading As the battle between bulls and bears ensues, he perceives the ongoing range-bound activity as a prelude to an imminent explosion. “Until then it&#8217;s just a lot of chop, stop hunts and liquidity grabs until one side comes out victorious.&#8221; Once the shackles of this consolidation are shattered, Daan predicts that the resulting breakout will mark the top for 2023: If BTC were to grind back to the highs from here, I&#8217;d be pretty confident that the next breakout will be the one where we finally break out of this area. I also think this would be the sharpest move and likely sets the top for 2023 followed by a slow rest of the year. [&#8230;]I would assume we&#8217;d visit approximately 36-40K in a quick fashion. Meanwhile, renowned analyst Skew shed light on the intricacies of Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics. With an eagle eye on the Binance Spot market, Skew discerns substantial BTC accumulation occurring. He revealed that the supply is concentrated between $31.3K and $32K, while demand persists between $29.5K and $28K. Unveiling the tactics of bigger players, Skew pointed to how whales employ aggressive short positions to manipulate the price within the narrow hourly range, exploiting bid liquidity and supply.
