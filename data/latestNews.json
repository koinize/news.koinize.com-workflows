On Aug 24, the official brands of Tinkoff and Sberbank disappeared from the Binance P2P platform, but the “yellow” and “green” options, representing their brand colors, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-dubs-barred-russian-banks-on-its-platform-as-yellow-and-green-cards\">were still present</a>. A day later the WSJ reported that the sanctioned banks <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-p2p-removes-sanctioned-russian-banks-from-payments-list\">were removed from the list altogether</a>, citing a Binance spokesperson. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-arrested-tornado-cash-developer-released-on-bail\"><strong><em>Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm released on bail, lawyer says</em></strong></a></p><p>Even though they were supposed to be removed, Cointelegraph discovered that Binance P2P users are still putting up ads for sales using \"the green bank\" as their preferred payment option. These users might mention other payment methods like Russian Standard Bank or Ak Bars Bank, but they make it clear in the \"advertiser's terms\" that they'll only accept transfers through \"the green bank.\"</p><p>The same thing goes, according to media reports, for both OKX and ByBit, where merchants still provide an option of exchange via sanctioned banks in private communication. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/banning-ransomware-payments-attractive-dangerous-idea/\"><strong><em>Should we ban ransomware payments?
