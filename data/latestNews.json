Despite the criticisms of Bitcoin’s energy intensity, the study provided a more balanced view of Bitcoin by showing the potential benefits BTC can bring to the energy industry. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/a3618dc2-37b0-48ec-89b4-d29754f8013e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Amount of vented methane that can be used in Bitcoin mining. Source: IRM</em></figcaption></figure><p>According to the report, Bitcoin mining can reduce global emissions by up to 8% by 2030. This can be done by converting the world’s wasted methane emissions into less harmful emissions. The report cited a theoretical case saying that using captured methane to power Bitcoin mining operations can reduce the amount of methane vented into the atmosphere. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-renewable-mix-emissions-good-for-investors-bloomberg-analyst\"><strong><em>Bitcoin energy pivot achieves what ‘few industries can claim’ — Bloomberg analyst</em></strong></a></p><p>The paper also presented other opportunities for Bitcoin to contribute to the energy sector. According to the report, Bitcoin can contribute to energy efficiency through electricity grid management by using Bitcoin miners and transferring heat from miners to greenhouses. </p><p>“We have shown that while Bitcoin is a consumer of electricity, this does not translate to it being a high emitter of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric pollutants. Bitcoin can be the catalyst to a cleaner, more energy-abundant future for all,” the authors wrote. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
