Those monthly credits are greater than the credits the company received for all of 2022, Les said. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/c7f78201-4643-4157-8b58-641dabd5539a.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Riot Platforms mining statistics for August.

Les said:</p><blockquote>“The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot’s cost to mine Bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of Bitcoin in the industry. Riot’s power strategy is a key competitive advantage.”</blockquote><p>Texas experienced particularly harsh weather in August, with temperatures near or above record-high levels for days on end.
