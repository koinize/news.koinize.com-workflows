    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-shows-signs-of-life-250/",
    "description": "BNB price avoided a major decline below $200 and recovered against the US Dollar. It climbed above $235 and now faces many hurdles near $245 and $250. BNB price is slowly moving higher toward the $250 resistance. The price is now trading above $235 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $241.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above $250. BNB Price Recovers 10% These past few days, BNB price managed to start a recovery wave above the $220 resistance. The recent positive moves in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins sparked a decent increase in BNB. There was a steady move above the $232 and $235 resistance levels. The price even climbed toward the $245 resistance. A high is formed near $245.8 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $222.5 swing low to the $245.8 high. BNB is also trading above $235 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $241.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $245 level. The next resistance sits near the $250 level. A clear move above the $250 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $265. A close above the $265 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $280 resistance. Downside Correction? If BNB fails to clear the $245 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $240 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $235 level or 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $222.5 swing low to the $245.8 high. If there is a downside break below the $235 support, the price could drop toward the $226 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $220 level. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level.
