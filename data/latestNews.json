This unforeseen breach has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, as Atomic Wallet’s fundamental premise relies on users assuming full responsibility for storing their assets securely. </p><p>The losses from the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/atomic-wallet-hackers-ofac-sanctioned-garantex-elliptic\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/atomic-wallet-hackers-ofac-sanctioned-garantex-elliptic/amp\">Atomic Wallet heist</a> have now <a href=\"https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/north-korea-linked-atomic-wallet-heist-tops-100-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">skyrocketed</a> to over $100 million, according to an analysis conducted by Elliptic. This alarming figure highlights the severity of the attack, which compromised an estimated 5,500 crypto wallets.</p><p>Despite the magnitude of the incident, Atomic Wallet has yet to provide any explanation regarding the root cause of these substantial losses. This has led to mounting concerns from frustrated users who anxiously await clarification and reassurance from the company. Meanwhile, at the time of publication, the company’s last update on Twitter was on June 7. </p><p>Frustrated Atomic Wallet users have taken to Twitter to express their annoyance at the way the company is handling the issue.

The firm’s attempts have allegedly resulted in the freezing of over $1 million worth of the stolen funds so far. However, the blockchain analysis company noted that “in response to the freezing of these funds, the thief has begun to change their behavior.
