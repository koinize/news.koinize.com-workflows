    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stellar/stellar-xlm-sheds-13-as-bearish-sentiments-take-over/",
    "description": "In the past week, Stellar (XLM) experienced a decline in price, moving from $0.1 to $0.096. This represents a decrease of -13.42% in value. Furthermore, in the past 24 hours, XLM recorded a minor drop of -0.61%. These price movements indicate a slight bearish sentiment prevailing in the crypto market, with XLM being influenced by the broader market conditions. The recent downtrend in XLM&#8217;s price suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, while the scope for bullish activity appears limited. What Could Be Responsible For The Recent Price Dip? The Stellar ecosystem has been rife with developments in recent months, with the biggest being the launch of the Spacewalk bridge that connects the blockchain to Polkadot. The bridge was meant to enable smooth transfer of the USDC stablecoin between the two blockchains fostering increased utility and potential demand within Stellar&#8217;s ecosystem.  However, this has not gone to plan, as Stellar&#8217;s price has failed to match the positive advancements in its ecosystem. Instead, bearish sentiment has engulfed XLM, which has contributed to the recent downward price movement. Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely The bearish sentiment indicates that market participants are cautious about XLM, leading to selling pressure and a lack of significant buying interest. It is important to consider the impact of market sentiment on short-term price fluctuations, as it can create challenges for price recovery and limit the potential for bullish momentum in the near term. What&#8217;s Next For Stellar (XLM)? Although XLM is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, the long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency remain positive. Stellar&#8217;s roadmap for 2023 focuses on enhancing network utility through strategic initiatives. This includes making innovation easy and scalable through Soroban development, scaling and decentralization endeavors, and improving developer wallet tools. Stellar aims to win over builders by accelerating the growth of widely-used assets, promoting accessibility and user-friendly apps, and leveraging smart contracts for sustainable use cases in the DeFi ecosystem.

These initiatives are designed to strengthen Stellar&#8217;s position in the market and drive future growth. While short-term price movements may be influenced by market sentiment, the long-term success of Stellar relies on the execution of its strategic initiatives and the adoption of its network utility. As a result, XLM&#8217;s value could potentially increase in the future, with projections indicating the possibility of reaching $0.11 by 2024. Investors and traders should closely monitor the progress of Stellar&#8217;s roadmap and evaluate market conditions when considering the future prospects of XLM. At press time, XLM was trading at $0.09691 per coin with a 1-hour price increase of 1.1%. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.
