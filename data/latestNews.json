The account was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFTmachine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">suspended</a> on X for “violating [its] rules.” According to a February 2022 thread from crypto investor Shual, the NFT Machine account was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xShual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">managed</a> by “doxxed American citizen” Tyler Gaye. A report from the Colorado section of LocalToday news also <a href=\"https://localtoday.news/co/denver-nft-scammers-fined-to-pay-275000-52396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">states</a> that Gaye and NFT Machine are the same person and that Gaye is a resident of Denver. The LocalToday report cites BusinessDen, a Colorado news site, as its source.</p><p>According to the LocalToday report, Gaye was sued by investors for allegedly creating a fraudulent scheme to raise money and spend it on nonfungible tokens (NFTs) for his personal collection. Using his NFT Machine account, Gaye promoted OpeNFT, raising $55,000 from investors. But instead of creating an NFT marketplace, he spent the funds on NFTs for himself, including many items from the MoonCats collection, the lawsuit alleged. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/zachxbt-alleges-gamegear-dev-scaredofboobs-scammer-nft-machine\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
