    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-vulnerable-below-225/",
    "description": "BNB price (Binance coin) failed to settle above $225 and trimmed gains against the US Dollar. The price could decline heavily if it trades below $210. Binance coin price tested the $235 resistance before the bears appeared against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $220 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain continue to move down unless there is a close above $225. Binance Coin Price Fails Again In the last analysis, we discussed the chances of BNB price recovering toward the $235 resistance zone. The price did climb higher toward the $235 resistance but failed to extend gains. It started a fresh decline from the $235 zone. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The pair is now showing bearish signs below $220 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A low is formed near $211.1 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, it is facing resistance near the $216.5 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $235 swing high to the $211 low. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $217 zone could send the price further higher. The next major resistance is near $225 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $235 swing high to the $211 low, above which the price might rise toward $235. A close above the $235 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. Another Decline in BNB? If BNB fails to clear the $217 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $211 level. The next major support is near the $210 level. If there is a downside break below the $210 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could send the price toward the $184 support. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $211, $210, and $202. Major Resistance Levels – $217, $225, and $235."
