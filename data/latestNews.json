    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a remarkable surge in recent times, mirroring the broader optimism sweeping the cryptocurrency market. This uptrend coincides with Bitcoin&#8217;s impressive rise above $63,000. Related Reading: Pepe Coin Soars Over 250% – Will March Bring More Surprises? Shiba Inu Explodes On The Weekly Timeframe The memecoin has witnessed significant gains, with a solid 61% jump in a 24-hour timeframe, a more impressive 124% increase over the week, and a stellar 50% growth in the past month. Source: Coingecko Notably, SHIB has finally clawed its way into positive territory for 2023, boasting a 10% gain since February. In addition to this, its market capitalization crossed the $8.5 billion barrier for the first time in a year. This bullish momentum is further bolstered by technical indicators. The recent price climb above $0.000014 has demonstrably reignited investor interest, as evidenced by the substantial 75% surge in trading volume. This suggests a potential breakout from a previous consolidation phase and could signal further upward movement if buying pressure persists. SHIB seven-day price rally. Source: Coingecko Market Strength And Bull Run Potential The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is nearing $2.5 trillion, a significant milestone. This uptick has fueled speculation among some analysts for a potential bull run, a period of sustained price increases. While past performance doesn&#8217;t guarantee future results, this rising market cap does suggest a return of investor confidence. Bitcoin is now trading at $61.970. Chart: TradingView.com These often highly volatile assets have experienced explosive price jumps, potentially contributing to a positive feedback loop within the broader market. This &#8220;meme coin frenzy&#8221; could be a sign of increased retail investor participation, which can be a double-edged sword, driving prices up but also increasing volatility. SHIB Investor Sentiment An interesting technical indicator is the improvement in Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor sentiment. Data suggests that over 50% of SHIB holders are currently sitting on profits, compared to a mere 10% in September 2022. This shift reflects the positive impact of the recent price increase and could further fuel buying pressure if the trend continues. Shifting Tides Meanwhile, on-chain data from Lookonchain indicates a sizeable investor, commonly referred to as a &#8220;whale,&#8221; has made a strategic shift in their holdings. This whale liquidated nearly 2 trillion PEPE tokens, profiting $3.5 million. This divestiture suggests the whale perceived PEPE to be nearing a price peak or no longer aligned with their investment goals. Related Reading: BNB Barrels Past $400, As Binance TVL Nears $5 Billion – Details Following the PEPE sale, the whale reinvested a portion, $893,000, into Shiba Inu (SHIB). This strategic allocation of 76 billion SHIB tokens suggests the whale anticipates potential growth in SHIB&#8217;s price. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that this is a singular instance.
