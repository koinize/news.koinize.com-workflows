    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holesky-testnet/",
    "description": "In a rare lapse in technological expertise, the recently unveiled Ethereum testnet, Holesky, failed to launch after developers discovered flaws in the testnet’s design.  Ethereum Holesky Testnet Riddled With Misconfigurations The crypto community and Ethereum enthusiasts are presently waiting for the return of Ethereum’s Holesky testnet which was scheduled to launch on Friday, September 15.  The Holesky testnet which was created to replace Ethereum’s Goerli testnet after its deprecation in 2024 encountered an unexpected technical hiccup on the day of its release. The release date marked a significant date in the Ethereum community’s history, commemorating the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s Merge to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network.   Related Reading: Jordan Peterson Sparks Debate On How Bitcoin Can Solve Major Banking Problem Ethereum developers have labeled the technical flaw as a “misconfiguration in the ExtraData field.” Reports reveal that the misconfiguration was identified by an Ethereum Researcher named Protolambda.  Holesky launch update! Due to a misconfiguration in the ExtraData field (applied to EL configs but not to CL ones), #Holesky didn&#8217;t initiate properly. A consensus has been reached among the EF DevOps and client teams to relaunch a week from now. — Nethermind (@NethermindEth) September 15, 2023 One of the DevOps at the Ethereum Foundation, Parithosh revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post the details of Holesky’s launch delay and misconfigurations. Parithosh explained that the flaw was found in one of Holesky’s Genesis files, the el Genesis file.  He stated that validators are currently working on the testnet and have succeeded in starting the chain; however, modifications on the network have not been completed so more time will be required to get the testnet back up and running ready for a relaunch.  “We had a misconfiguration in the el genesis file and that led to the Holesky network improperly launching. Some validators manually fixed the config and were able to start the chain, but not enough for the network to finalize,” Parithosh said in the X post. ETH price still hold above $1,600 support &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Holesky Testnet Scheduled For a Relaunch The Holesky testnet was created to introduce a range of features and enhancements in the Ethereum ecosystem. The testnet was loaded with more than 1 billion Holesky Ether (HETH) to ensure that the network was large and strong enough to handle complex tests on upgrades and developments in the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum’s Holesky testnet has now been rescheduled for release in two weeks. However, no proper date has been announced regarding the relaunch.  “It&#8217;s extremely likely that we relaunch the network with new genesis files and have the network up two weeks from now,” Ethereum developer, Parithosh stated.  Related Reading: Ethereum Merge Is One: Here Are The Highlights So Far While the delay is undoubtedly disappointing to many users, developers have vowed to integrate more validation steps and better docs to make the Holesky testnet stronger and prevent future misconfigurations.  The delay in Ethereum’s Holesky testnet has not overly affected the price of its native token, ETH. Presently Ethereum developers are working vigorously to resolve the issue as fast as possible. The Ethereum community also remains hopeful that the delay will result in a more robust and reliable testing environment that will greatly benefit the Ethereum ecosystem.
