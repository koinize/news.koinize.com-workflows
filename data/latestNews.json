The point of paying for Twitter blue is so we have additional features not to take away a common, free feature and put a paywall behind it.”</blockquote><p>“In our opinion, this is a sales funnel to get more users verified and into [Twitter] Blue, not to combat spam,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1682512283157827584\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">added</a> the popular citizen journalist account @AustimCapital. </p><p>Several users also argued that limiting DMs for unverified accounts would likely just result in verified accounts being able to spam in DMs anyway. </p><p>While others suggested that the move is more about Twitter pushing people to pay for verification to cover its hefty operational costs, rather than fighting spam. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sounds like Twitter can&#39;t afford to pay for enough server capacity to support DMs anymore. <a href=\"https://t.co/6ovxRxNPVL\">https://t.co/6ovxRxNPVL</a></p>&mdash; David Olsen (@DDsD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DDsD/status/1682507605565140992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The upcoming move follows a host of radical changes to the platform that have been introduced under Elon Musk’s ownership. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/web-3-andreessen-horowitz-exec-sees-promising-paths-for-web3-social-platforms-eth-cc-6\"><strong><em>Andreessen Horowitz exec sees ‘promising paths’ for Web3 social platforms — EthCC</em></strong></a></p><p>On July 1, Twitter imposed a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-down-elon-musk-rate-limit-exceeded\">significant rate limit</a> on the number of posts users could see daily, in a bid to curb data scraping and “system manipulation.”</p><p>This subsequently saw Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta launch a Twitter alternative called <em>Instagram Threads, </em>which drew in a lot of initial hype and a large user base only for it to go and<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/threads-rate-limit-spam-crypto-bots-twitter\"> introduce its own rate limits</a> on July 18. </p><p>In April, Twitter also rolled out <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-introduces-twitter-monetization-avenues-for-content-creators\">content monetization settings</a> on its platform, enabling creators to monetize all forms of posts globally. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/tokenizing-music-royalties-nfts-taylor-swift-3lau-nas-the-weeknd/\"><strong><em>Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
