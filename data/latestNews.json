To make conditions more challenging for miners, the mining difficulty reached a new all-time high, reducing miner profitability.</p><p>Historical trends show that the network’s hashrate could continue to rise leading up to the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter\">halving</a> on April 26, 2024 as miners increase their hash power by installing new efficient machines.</p><p>Besides adding to their processing power, miners are also adopting other hedging techniques like selling Bitcoin futures to lock in current prices. </p><p>As the network's hashrate is expected to increase through the year as miners reinvest in new machines and adopt other hedging techniques, miner profitability and stock valuations will continue to face pressure in the lead-up to the event.</p><h2>Bitcoin hashrate projected to grow until halving</h2><p>While BTC price has increased by around 80% year-to-date, the mining difficulty also increased by 51%, offsetting the rise in profitability due to price surge. </p><p>In mid-July, Bitcoin's difficulty set a new all-time high of 53.91 trillion units. The increase in difficulty triggered a capitulation event in the sector, which was already <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-hits-all-time-high-as-btc-miner-selling-peaks\">reeling under pressure</a> at the start of the month.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/0f814cd2-47c8-4221-89c8-94c109564326.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD price chart with hash ribbon indicator.

The total hashrate is still ranging above last month’s lows after rising consistently since the start of 2023.</p><p>Moreover, historical trends suggest that miners will likely continue adding to their fleet, which could cramp profitability further. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/68315ad3-8b27-47eb-b4ca-de0ba0d993ad.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin daily hashrate.

The current rise in the network’s hashrate is showing a similar trend. </p><h2>Miners are preparing for the halving </h2><p>Besides increasing hashpower, the miners are adopting various strategies to prepare for the event. </p><p>These strategies involve improving the cash flow and profits of their operations by managing the existing and newly mined BTC before the halving.</p><p>In the previous cycle, Bitcoin miners had started accumulating BTC a year before the event and began unloading only after the rewards were slashed. However, with less than 9 months or three quarters left for the next halving, the trend hasn’t repeated yet. Miners were seen <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-miners-millions-crypto-exchanges-5-things-bitcoin\">sending large amounts of BTC</a> to exchanges. </p><p>The one-hop supply of miners, which represents the coins received from mining pools, dipped toward a 2023 low in July. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/3a8e2bf4-b858-477c-b527-b434a60dfae9.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin one-hop supply.

For instance, selling BTC one-year futures allows miners to lock in a selling price of $30,000 for next year.</p><p>Some miners could also be selling to improve their cash balances before the halving. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Miners are selling record amounts of newly mined <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> to cover operational costs.
