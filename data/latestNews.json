During Q3 2023, the exchange says it onboarded over 9,000 traders along with 85,000 followers or copy-traders, who together achieved a net trading profit of $6.7 million. However, the combined industry trading activity fell by 23% year over year to $4.8 trillion in the quarter.</p><p>From July to September, Bitget’s user protection fund peaked at $368 million and now stands at $350 million. The exchange claims that it has no debt alongside a proof-of-reserves ratio exceeding 200%.

Last December, Cointelegraph reported the Chinese government’s official NFT trading platform was planned to launch this year. The exchange is still in development at the time of publication. Since 2021, China has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-miner-gets-life-in-prison-china-offers-bounties-for-crypto-firms-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >officially banned </a>almost all crypto-related activity saved for outright ownership of cryptocurrencies. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-blockchain-connects-interprovincial-health-insurance-in-china\">Blockchain connects interprovincial health insurance in China</h2><p>Residents of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces can now <a href=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_25055531\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >submit</a> and validate their health insurance claims using blockchain technology. </p><p>In a partnership with Alibaba’s Ant Insurance, users in the aforementioned regions can submit their claims online, and after blockchain verification for authenticity, receive their reimbursement within hours. </p><p>In one instance, an individual known as Mr. Wang submitted his claim for lung cancer treatment in Anhui, and received the full $17,800 (130,000 Chinese Yuan) reimbursement within two hours. Su Fang, Director of the Financial Insurance Institute of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, commented:</p><p>“This time, all electronic financial and medical bills in the Yangtze River Delta have been opened and applied on a large scale in commercial insurance claims, marking the true application of the digital Yangtze River Delta construction.

As soon as a visitor is identified to be trespassing in an unauthorized area, the system will alert court bailiffs for their immediate apprehension. Officials say that the system can drastically reduce the patrolling of hard-to-monitor areas: </p><p>“Outside the court walls and in the public rest areas outside the courtroom of the main building, etc., intelligent behavior analysis technology can be used to capture and intelligently analyze the behavior of the parties, provide early warning of possible dangerous behaviors such as abnormal gatherings, strenuous exercise, fights, etc., and remind judicial police and other staff to pay attention and deal with it promptly and appropriately.”</p><p>Through the system, court bailiffs would gain access to all visitors’ movements and details within court premises.
