It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good,” Buterin said. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">OK WE TRY AGAIN! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitalikButerin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RsEag1VAKr\">https://t.co/RsEag1VAKr</a></p>&mdash; Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1676998397092298773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The nearly two-hour-long conversation centered around the issue of scalability. Wall claimed Bitcoin’s Lightning Network can’t scale for future users and it fails “frequently” when processing “even medium-sized payments.”</p><p>In response, Buterin suggested the best approach would be to focus on implementing different types of layer-2 solutions along with looking for ways to make the Bitcoin base layer more efficient. </p><blockquote>“I think focusing on rollups is good and so is being open to ZK-snark-based scaling solutions.”</blockquote><p>Wertheimer believed the introduction of rollups could create an interesting side effect.</p><p>“If we adopted rollups for Bitcoin, we actually get an execution environment too […] We can do smart contracts,” Wertheimer said. </p><p>Wall and Wertheimer — two key figures behind the Ordinals project Taproot Wizards — are outspoken exponents of Ordinals and routinely advocate for building increased functionality on top of the Bitcoin network.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-raked-millions-in-fees-q2-amid-ordinals\"><strong><em>Bitcoin miners raked $184M in fees in Q2, surpassing all of 2022</em></strong></a></p><p>Their stance has drawn criticism from more fundamentalist Bitcoiners who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-protocol-sparks-debate-over-nft-s-place-in-the-bitcoin-ecosystem\">claim NFTs and smart contracts</a> on Bitcoin dilute its supposed primary function as a peer-to-peer cash network.</p><p>Such critics include Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-and-brc-20-will-disappear-in-months-jan3-ceo-says\">believes Ordinals waste block space</a> that could otherwise be dedicated to Bitcoin payments. </p><p>Wall noted these criticisms and explained that Bitcoin could be used as a “proof system” for zero-knowledge proofs which wouldn’t congest the network.</p><p>“My perspective is that we [Bitcoiners] always wanted to do DeFi adjacent things but we just wanted the Bitcoin base layer to just act as sort of a judge or an arbiter of that computation and not have to run the computation on-chain,” Wall said. </p><blockquote>“We shouldn't necessarily just be thinking about second layers as a way to make payments, but I think we could also think about them [as a way of doing] expressive things.”</blockquote><p>The discussion yielded fresh controversy in the Bitcoin community, with Wertheimer slamming Mow and Blockstream CEO Adam Beck for being dismissive of the conversation with Buterin.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These 2 laser-eye clowns have been running blockstream into the ground for the last decade<br><br>In 10 years that company couldn’t come up with a single successful product<br><br>Their joke of a blockchain processes 3 txs a day<br><br>And they think they have nothing to learn from ethereum <a href=\"https://t.co/mp7we9Lvxq\">pic.twitter.com/mp7we9Lvxq</a></p>&mdash; Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1677073498081050624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ordinals-turned-bitcoin-into-a-worse-version-of-ethereum-can-we-fix-it/\"><strong><em>Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
