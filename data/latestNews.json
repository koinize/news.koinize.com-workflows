    "description": "PayPal has taken another step in its crypto mission following a team-up with hardware wallet provider Ledger. This time around, the payments giant is making it possible for users to purchase crypto directly without the need for extra verifications. Ledger Live Integration With Paypal On August 16, Ledger and PaPal announced an integration to make buying cryptocurrencies easier. This feature will allow users to purchase crypto using PayPal directly from the Ledger Live app. Chairman and CEO Pascal Gauthier of Ledger made a statement about integrating Ledger Live with Paypal to make crypto transactions easier. “Both PayPal and Ledger are focused on creating secure, seamless, and fast transactions no matter where you are in the world. PayPal,&#8221; Gauthier said. &#8220;We’re combining the uncompromising security of Ledger with PayPal&#8217;s leadership in protected payments technology to help facilitate a seamless platform for user crypto transactions.&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Ledger Live’s integration with Paypal currently offers four cryptocurrencies in the US, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC), and this will allow US residents to be able to purchase these cryptocurrencies with their verified Paypal accounts with no extra verification required. What makes this integration so interesting is that no &#8220;withdrawal&#8221; process needs to be initiated by a user. All the crypto purchases made through Paypal via Ledger Live are immediately sent to the user&#8217;s wallet, according to the announcement. PYPL price drops to $59 &#124; Source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Tradingview.com Ledger Live’s integration with Paypal is indeed a significant step in the financial tech world, as the two giants share a similar vision of creating fast and seamless transactions on a universal scale. Ledger is one of the most notable hardware wallet manufacturers, recording over 6 million Ledger Nano hardware wallet sales all around the world since 2016. Also, Ledger launched its Tradelink service in 2023 that will enable &#8220;off-exchange trading, enhanced security, distribution of risk, zero transaction fees, and a more efficient and faster trading” for institutional investors. Paypal’s interest in the crypto world is by no means new. On August 7, Paypal made an announcement to launch its own Ethereum-based stablecoin called PYUSD.  However, nothing was said about PYUSD being listed as one of the coins that will be available on the Ledger Live just yet. Related Reading: Executives Of Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Step Down As Lawsuits, Liquidation Rages On PYUSD’s launch has not been smooth either with regulators calling for more oversight following the launch. Last week, US congresswoman Maxine Waters called for federal oversight and enforcement of PayPal after launching the stablecoin. PayPal also revealed plans to allow select customers to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum using PYUSD. However, amid the new UK regulatory system that will come into play on October 8, Paypal plans to temporarily pause the buying of cryptocurrencies in the country from October 1 to resume crypto services in the Q1 of 2024.
