    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/nft-market/blur-down-30-whales-to-blame/",
    "description": "Blur, a decentralized non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, and OpenSea competitor is under pressure, tumbling by over 30% from its November peaks. While BLUR retreats, on-chain data reveals that BLUR whales have been moving their tokens to leading crypto exchanges, possibly to liquidate. Whales On A Possible Selling Spree According to Lookonchain¬†data¬†on December 7, several whales have been offloading large amounts of BLUR. To illustrate, 16.85 million BLUR, worth roughly $8.43 million, were deposited to exchanges in the past 24 hours.¬† Notably, one whale deposited 2.54 million BLUR, worth $1.26 million, received from the airdrop to Binance. At the same time, Mandala Capital transferred 2.76 million BLUR, worth $1.4 million, to OKX.¬† The deluge continued as another whale, only marked by the associated &#8220;0x68b5&#8221; address, withdrew 3.31 million BLUR worth $1.79 million from Binance between November 25 and 29 before moving them to the same exchange on December 1. The token had fallen, meaning the whale was down by roughly $65,000. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Enough Capital? Experts On What Will Lead To ATH It is unclear whether the same addresses are sold for USDT or other tokens. However, what&#8217;s known is that any whale transfers to a centralized exchange is associated with liquidation. Accordingly, sentiment is impacted when whales move coins in large batches to exchanges, and retailers could interpret their transfers as incoming selling pressure. BLUR Is Up 220% From October Lows Thus far, looking at price action, buyers have the lead from a top-down preview. The coin is already up 220% from October lows. Most importantly, buyers have the upper hand, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart.¬† Even though the token is down 30% from November peaks, the failure of bears to force the coin below the 20-day moving average (MA) in the daily chart suggests that the uptrend is still valid. Losses below $0.46, or the base of the current bull flag, might trigger a sell-off. Conversely, any upswing above $0.58 and even $0.69&#8211;or November highs, could drive more demand, lifting BLUR to $0.84 or higher in the coming sessions.

What&#8217;s clear, though, is that the broader community is closely monitoring the NFT scene and Blur, the marketplace. The recent upswing was due to the activation of Season 2 Airdrop, which ended on November 20. Ahead of this, the token was already up 150%, only to extend gains briefly before cooling off in the first week of December. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
