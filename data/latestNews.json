They also make reservations that in the online form, users’ data would still be visible only to their particular financial institutions and not the CBDC infrastructure provider, Eurosystem. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-data-protection-regulators-urge-anonymity-smaller-transactions-in-digital-euro\"><strong><em>EU data protection regulators urge anonymity for smaller transactions in digital euro</em></strong></a></p><p>According to the project calendar published in the text, the current “preparation phase,” launched on Oct. 18, will finish by 2025. However, the final decision on the issuance of the pan-EU CBDC still wasn’t made. </p><p>The Bank of Finland recently expressed the same amicable sentiment towards the digital euro. Its board member, Tuomas Välimäki, called it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-finland-instant-payments-system-embraces-digital-euro\">“the most topical project”</a> in the European payment sector. </p><p>On Oct. 25, the European Central Bank (ECB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb/status/1717103712651358235?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">shared</a> a link to the landing page dedicated to basic information about the digital euro.
