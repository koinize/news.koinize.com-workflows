However, Gensler’s dig at the cryptocurrency market became a talking point for the crypto community on social media, where Gensler noted, “Don’t get me started on crypto. I won’t even name all the individuals we’ve charged in this highly noncompliant field.”</p><p>While talking about the economic perspective of the SEC’s enforcement action, Gensler noted that the agency filed more than 780 enforcement actions in 2023, including more than 500 standalone cases. The enforcement actions led to judgments and orders totaling $5 billion, out of which $930 million were distributed to harmed investors.</p><p>Gensler added that the SEC had filed lawsuits against 40 firms for violations of various rules and regulations since December 2021, leading to more than $1.5 billion in penalties. Gensler revealed that the SEC settled recordkeeping-related charges with 23 firms in the last fiscal year alone.</p><p>In his speech, the SEC chief reiterated his earlier stance on crypto, claiming that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket and, thus, must be governed under the same law. In his explanation of the broad definition of security, Gensler explained the concept of an “investment contract” and why a major chunk of the cryptocurrency market resembles it. According to Gensler, most cryptocurrency assets will pass the investment contract test, making them governed by securities regulations.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-clo-calls-sec-latest-filing-hypocritical-pivot\"><strong><em>Ripple lawyer calls SEC’s latest filing “hypocritical pivot”</em></strong></a> </p><p>Gensler went on to draw comparisons between the current crypto ecosystem and the financial landscape of the 1920s when securities laws were not in place. Gensler said that the crypto ecosystem is suffering from the same situation as the financial landscape before clear regulations came into place, leading to several scams, frauds and bankruptcies. He argued these issues necessitate stricter regulations. </p><blockquote>“Without prejudging any one asset, the vast majority of crypto assets likely meet the investment contract test, making them subject to the securities laws.”</blockquote><p>The SEC chief’s criticism of the crypto market is not new, and he has reiterated a similar stance for several years now. However, the crypto community, including some of the key businesses operating in the U.S. along with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chief-gary-gensler-to-face-congress-grueling-over-crypto-policy\">Congress members</a>, have called upon <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gary-gensler-sec-holds-line-crypto-enforcement-senate-hearing\">Gensler to offer more clarity on crypto regulations</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

In the 34th episode of Cointelegraph’s <em>Hashing It Out</em>, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw interviews Ryan Li, co-founder of CyberConnect, about the concept of decentralized social media. </p><p>Li kicks off the episode by explaining the rationale behind creating social media platforms running on blockchain. Li points out that Web3 social media platforms give content creators the confidence that they won’t be abandoned when the platform gets bigger or shifts its focus to ad revenue, unlike traditional platforms. This feature is built on top of a decentralized financial system, and the speculative nature of the space creates a strong case for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-socialfi-a-beginners-guide-to-the-social-network-of-the-future\">SocialFi</a>.</p><p>Li also highlights updates in recent years that have shone<strong> </strong>a spotlight on decentralized social media applications. Developments like the addition of account abstraction by CyberConnect and new gamified ways to increase engagements on SocialFi platforms have created some buzz around the sector. </p><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2096415\"></template><p>A decentralized social media platform taking the space by storm recently is Friend.tech. The platform became the most used decentralized application on Coinbase’s Base network after recording revenue of 10,663 Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), with total value locked of over 30,000 ETH in less than two months. Despite the growth, the platform has attracted critics, and Li shares an interesting opinion about the platform, describing it as a security:</p><blockquote>“However, when you say if it’s a security, I would kind of say it might be because the price of a key, even though it’s trading against a battling curve, it’s not trading with another person.“</blockquote><p>Beyond decentralized social media, Owusu Akyaw and Li discussed how the latest changes at major platforms like Meta and X (formerly Twitter) affect adoption. Li explains that X’s new monetization strategy and Meta’s seemingly unsuccessful experiment with Threads may catalyze Web3 social media adoption. According to the CyberConnect co-founder, users are likely to make a move due to a single feature they love and stay because of the infrastructure they find. </p><p>Listen to the latest episode of <em>Hashing It Out</em> with Ryan Li, co-founder of CyberConnect, on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ibvcrJ87PAso4DBIiE5qn?si=5071800991044f7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hashing-it-out/id1658998696?app=podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yMDk2NDE1LnJzcw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Google Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/Hashing-It-Out-p3083469/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TuneIn</a>.
