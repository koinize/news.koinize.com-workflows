Iman also said that it’s important to “take profits on the top” and not get attached to the holdings so they can liquidate and reenter at the right times.  </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-strategies-market-dips-buying-tips\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
