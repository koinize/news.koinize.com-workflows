    "description": "\n                        <p dir=\"ltr\">Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s legal team has lodged an appeal against his bail revocation, arguing that his constitutional right to adequately prepare for the upcoming trial is being compromised.</p>\nBail Revocation For &ldquo;Witness Tampering&rdquo;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan had revoked Bankman-Fried's bail due to allegations that he attempted to tamper with witnesses linked to his trial, which included Caroline Ellison and former FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller. The move led to Bankman-Fried's incarceration, sparking controversy around his access to a fair trial.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the allegations, Bankman-Fried had revealed the personal writings of his former colleague and romantic partner, Caroline Ellison, who has also been embroiled in the FTX controversy. The writings, predating FTX's collapse, showcased Ellison's emotional state and reflections on her job and her breakup with Bankman-Fried.</p>\nProsecutors vs Defense\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prosecutors have contended that Bankman-Fried's disclosure of these writings was intended to harass Ellison and potentially discourage potential witnesses from testifying if they feared negative publicity. They argue that his actions were an attempt to exert undue influence on the proceedings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bankman-Fried's attorneys had attempted to challenge the judge&rsquo;s decision and sought to prevent his immediate detention until the appeal was heard. These efforts, however, were unsuccessful. The legal tussle is now in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the court will need to weigh the former CEO's First Amendment rights against the alleged interference with witness testimony.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The defense maintains that his actions were not meant to intimidate or threaten but rather to safeguard himself. He had shared part of Ellison's private diary with a reputable newspaper, citing self-protection as the motivation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They wrote,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It is unclear how a cooperating witness who has promised to testify against a defendant could be meaningfully threatened by nothing but their own statements being published by a reputable newspaper.&rdquo;</p>\n\nChallenges Faced in Detention\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Presently held at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, Bankman-Fried is claiming to face challenges in adequately preparing for his trial. His legal team argues that his confinement interferes with his ability to participate in the trial preparations, a fundamental constitutional right. The judge also denied his request to remain out of jail during weekends, aimed at aiding his preparations.</p>\nUpcoming Trial and Additional Charges\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bankman-Fried's trial is slated to commence in October and will address charges including wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and related conspiracy allegations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a recent development, he has been hit with seven new charges pertaining to the alleged donation of $100 million worth of customer funds to political campaigns. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the new charges as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/paypal-pyusd-stablecoin/",
    "description": "Paypal&#8217;s Ethereum-based stablecoin PYUSD has failed to capture crypto investors&#8217; interest. According to data from Nansen, 90% of the stablecoin&#8217;s total supply still remains with its issuer Paxos&#8217; wallet. Paypal&#8217;s PYUSD Adoption Setback The payment giant Paypal&#8217;s recently launched stablecoin PYUSD continues to struggle with adoption and has failed to gain traction since its official launch on August 7, 2023. Despite PayPal having over 350 million users worldwide, on-chain data from Nansen has shown that only a small percentage of its user base is currently using and holding the PYUSD in self-custody wallets. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Proves Positive As Shiba Inu-Based BONE Celebrates New Milestone “On the surface there’s a lack of demand from crypto users for PYUSD when other alternatives exist,” said Nansen in a report. However, it is believed that lack of enthusiasm might involve the stablecoin&#8217;s lack of utility and not being able to earn interest on the stablecoin, as highlighted by an X (formerly Twitter) user in a post on August 26, 2023. 🚨Problem: Nobody wants to mint $pyUSD because there&#8217;s not much to do with it and it doesn&#8217;t pay any interest. 💡Solution: &#8211; $pyUSD &#8211; $crvUSD pool &#8211; $CRV gauge approval from Curve DAO@PayPal 🤝 @CurveFinance $PYPL #DeFi https://t.co/jVr7sN36KH pic.twitter.com/NUdsKmfY8F — DefiMoon 🦇🔊 (@DefiMoon) August 26, 2023 The stablecoin&#8217;s holdings on crypto exchange wallets are also low, accounting for just about 7% of the stablecoin&#8217;s total supply. This percentage takes into account the balances on centralized exchanges such as Kraken, Crypto.com, and Gate.io. Despite the high expectations in the crypto industry following the release of the stablecoin that it would actually promote wider adoption and introduce cryptocurrencies to the masses for the first time, the stablecoin has failed to live up to expectations and smart money investors seem perfectly comfortable to circumvent the stablecoin.  The largest holder of the stablecoin holds less than $10,000 worth of PYUSD after the holder sold about 3 meme coins to purchase the stablecoin. Excluding contracts or exchanges, not more than 10 holders have a balance surpassing $1,000. According to Coinmarketcap, PYUSD has a total supply of 43 million PYUSD tokens and pools in decentralized exchanges like Uniswap&#8217;s PYUSD/USDC and PYUSD/wETH accounts to only 50,000 PYUSD tokens respectively. The PYUSD tokens have been criticized for being overly centralized, as the majority of its total supply turns out to be stored on centralized exchanges, resulting in difficulty in growing its circulation. Despite such a high total supply, the collective total number of the stablecoin&#8217;s holders according to Etherscan is merely 324 at the time of this writing. PayPal's stablecoin maintains dollar peg &#124; Source: PYUSD/USD on Tradingview.com Expectations On Ethereum For The Stablecoin According to JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, following the first week of Paypal&#8217;s stablecoin launch, Ethereum enjoyed no benefit from PYUSD when looking at things such as increased network activity, increased Total Value Locked (TVL), and enhancing Ethereum&#8217;s network utility as a stablecoin/DeFi platform. Related Reading: JP Morgan Explains Why Bitcoin Price May Not Fall Further Crypto experts and enthusiasts have also criticized PayPal for choosing Ethereum for its stablecoin due to the blockchain&#8217;s high transaction fees. Co-founder of Sei Network Jayendra Jog said, &#8220;The gas fees of using PYUSD will be ridiculous, which will disincentivize its usage.” He further added, &#8220;To help make the user experience better, PayPal will either need to subsidize transaction costs or will need to help support PYUSD on other networks with cheaper gas fees.&#8221; Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com"
