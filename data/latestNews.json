Source: Baidu</em></figcaption></figure><p>In its analysis, the SlowMist team found that the recently created fake Skype application bore version number 8.87.0.403, while the latest version of Skype is actually 8.107.0.215. The team also discovered that the phishing back-end domain ‘bn-download3.com’ impersonated the Binance exchange on Nov. 23, 2022, and later changed it to mimic a Skype backend domain on May 23, 2023. The fake Skype app was first reported by a user who lost 'a significant amount of money' to the same scam.</p><p>The fake app's signature revealed that it had been tampered with to insert malware, and after decompiling the app the security team discovered that it modified a commonly used Android network framework called okhttp3 to target crypto users. The default okhttp3 framework handles Android traffic requests, but the modified okhttp3 obtains images from various directories on the phone and monitors for any new images in real-time.</p><p>The malicious okhttp3 requests users to give access to internal files and images, and as most social media applications ask for these permissions anyway they often don’t suspect any wrongdoing. Thus, the fake Skype immediately begins uploading images, device information, user ID, phone number, and other information to the back end. </p><p>Once the fake app has access, it continuously looks for images and messages with TRX and ETH-like address format strings. If such addresses are detected, they are automatically replaced with malicious addresses pre-set by the phishing gang.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/96c867ad-32b6-4002-be34-a243519adf8d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fake Skype app backend.

    "description": "Throughout the majority of the year, the Avalanche (AVAX) coin has seen a predominantly bearish trend. However, it has recently exhibited a noteworthy resurgence. Avalanche has demonstrated remarkable performance within the cryptocurrencies sector, exhibiting a significant increase of 10% during the past 24 hours. The AVAX price, which is currently valued at $18.12, exhibits a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern. From an optimistic perspective, the escalating demand has the potential to drive the bullish trend to surpass the $20 threshold. Related Reading: Mysterious Wallet Transfers 18 Million MATIC To Coinbase – What’s Going On? AVAX shows an impressive figure in the weekly timeframe. Source: CoinMarkeCap Indeed, the recent surge of 45% in the altcoin&#8217;s value over the past week has facilitated its ascendancy to the apex of the current top 20 coin rankings. The AVAX cryptocurrency is now experiencing an upward trajectory, with its objective being the reacquisition of the $20 threshold. Will the cryptocurrency surge persist, leading AVAX to exceed the $20 mark, or is a potential retracement on the horizon? The price of Avalanche has recently increased substantially for three key reasons. First off, it had a significant increase subsequent to the announcement made by Coinbase on its plans to incorporate support for AVAX and SOL perpetual futures contracts. In the majority of instances, the value of cryptocurrencies experiences a significant increase following their inclusion on one of the largest global exchanges. Secondly, the success of the token&#8217;s rise is consistent with that of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, and Bitcoin. Supporters of a spot Bitcoin ETF are jubilant about its possible approval. Additionally, Blackrock submitted an application for an Ethereum ETF last week. Related Reading: Boom!

Avalanche will be a great one to see if this occurs due of its enormous scale. AVAX price action in the last 24-hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Avalanche has gained significant popularity on numerous social media platforms. Further evidence indicates that there has been a notable upward trend in the open interest of futures. The total revenue reached a peak of more than $156 million throughout the course of the weekend. Bybit, OKX, and Bybit accounted for the remainder of this open interest, after Binance. A significant increase in futures open interest generally indicates heightened demand. As the cryptocurrency community eagerly watches AVAX&#8217;s ascent, the question remains: will it maintain its momentum and breach the $20 mark, or is a retracement on the horizon? Time will tell as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.
