    "description": "Renowned Bitcoin analyst PlanB, known for his stock-to-flow model for BTC, has made a bold prediction regarding the future price of BTC. What sets this forecast apart is its evaluation in terms of gold ounces, shedding light on a unique perspective. The PlanB Projection: Bitcoin Meteoric Rise According to PlanB&#8217;s recent post on X, he foresees a monumental shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, expected to rise significantly in the coming years. Drawing a comparison with gold, PlanB highlighted that currently, one Bitcoin is equivalent to 26 ounces of gold, valuing an ounce of gold at $2,000. Bitcoin = 26 ounces of Gold. It would surprise me if BTC would stay below 100 ounces of Gold in 2024/2025. pic.twitter.com/IghU4u7gCy ‚Äî PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 19, 2024 Looking ahead to 2024-2025, PlanB predicts that Bitcoin&#8217;s price could skyrocket to roughly 100 gold ounces, translating to $200,000 in fiat currency terms. Related Reading: 16,000 Bitcoin Dormant Since 5+ Years Suddenly Moves, What‚Äôs Going On? Delving deeper into the charted trajectory, PlanB anticipates Bitcoin to climb to 35 gold ounces ($70,000) by 2024 and surge to 300 gold ounces by 2025. This projection would place Bitcoin&#8217;s value at a price target of $600,000, marking a monumental milestone in its journey. Correct. And more if gold price rises too. ‚Äî PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 19, 2024 Bullish Momentum Fuels Bitcoin&#8217;s Rise As Bitcoin continues to capture the attention of investors, recent weeks have witnessed a notable bullish momentum propelling the cryptocurrency forward. With a surge of more than 20% over this period, Bitcoin has crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold, accompanied by a trading volume hovering above $20 billion in the past week alone. This surge in activity has ignited optimism among investors and traders, leading to a significant accumulation of the asset. Notably, Whale Alert data reveals that earlier today a substantial withdrawal of approximately $962.15 million from the leading US crypto exchange, Coinbase, to an undisclosed address, underscoring the heightened interest in Bitcoin. üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® 9,322 #BTC (485,247,899 USD) transferred from #Coinbase to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/AEyqa8qFQ9 ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) February 19, 2024 Meanwhile, the Bitcoin open interest has surged to over $24 billion, marking a 50% increase since the start of 2024. This surge in open interest, a metric representing the total value of outstanding derivative contracts, signifies heightened market activity and interest in Bitcoin futures and options trading.
