    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/helium-hnt/solana-powered-helium-hnt-spikes-by-145-analyzing-the-drivers-of-the-surge/",
    "description": "Helium (HNT), a decentralized network launched in 2019, has experienced significant gains across multiple timeframes, making it one of the top performers in the cryptocurrency market. This price surge comes alongside Solana&#8217;s (SOL) remarkable 56% increase over the past 30 days and other protocols built on Solana&#8217;s network. HNT has achieved staggering gains over the past 30 days, surpassing 147%. This remarkable growth has continued with gains of 101% and 45% over the past fourteen and seven days, respectively.  In the 24-hour time frame alone, HNT reached a high of $5.008 and experienced a remarkable surge of 53%, a level not seen since October 2022. But what are the main catalysts behind this spike? Helium&#8217;s Mobile Service Launch Ignites HNT Investor Frenzy The recent surge in HNT&#8217;s price can be attributed to the announcement made by the Helium network on December 5. The network revealed that users across the United States can now enjoy unlimited data, voice, and text services for a monthly fee of $20 through their newly launched mobile service. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin According to recent reports, Helium Mobile, a subsidiary of Nova Labs, introduced this no-contract nationwide mobile service, aiming to provide consumers with an affordable and unrestricted mobile experience.  This move comes when major carriers have been imposing data limits, increasing contract obligations, and raising prices, making Helium&#8217;s offering particularly appealing to users seeking more flexible and cost-effective options. By offering unlimited data, voice, and text services for a flat fee of $20 per month, Helium Mobile aims to address the growing demand for affordable and unrestricted mobile connectivity.  According to the announcement, the company aims to empower customers by putting control back into their hands, challenging the practices of traditional carriers. CEO Amir Haleem Calls For Transparency In Mobile Industry Amir Haleem, CEO of Nova Labs, emphasized the company&#8217;s belief that cell phones are essential and that unlimited data, text, and calls should be standard offerings.  Haleem criticized carriers for concealing high subscription rates, roaming fees, and additional data charges behind seemingly attractive phone upgrade options that often lock customers into costly plans for extended periods. In addition to its mobile service, Helium Mobile supports a people-powered coverage model, allowing customers to become network owners and operators. Like platforms like Airbnb or Uber, the company believes that “reducing monopolies” and empowering customers can improve service quality, lower costs, and overall benefits for all stakeholders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Pump Of Epic Proportions To $0.7, Here’s When As the demand for reliable and affordable mobile services grows, Helium&#8217;s approach has positioned it as a key player in the industry. This announcement has propelled HNT&#8217;s price upward as investors recognize the potential of Helium&#8217;s approach in the mobile service sector. The trading price of HNT stands at $4.153, marking a significant breakout from its downtrend structure of the past 11 months. The cryptocurrency is now targeting its next resistance level at $4.70.  However, should HNT fail to surpass this resistance, it will be crucial for the coin to maintain support at the $3.00 level to sustain its current bullish momentum.
