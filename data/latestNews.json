    "description": "An analyst has explained that Worldcoin is currently showing a breakout from a pattern that could potentially lead to a rally of 80% for WLD. Worldcoin Appears To Be Showing A Bullish Breakout Currently In a new post on X, analyst Ali shared a chart for the 4-hour price of Worldcoin, which shows the formation of a bull flag for the cryptocurrency. A &#8220;bull flag&#8221; is a continuation pattern in technical analysis that, as its name suggests, looks like a flag on a pole. Bull flags form when a rapid uptrend in the price slows down and reverses in the opposite direction while consolidating inside a specific channel. The preceding uptrend forms the &#8220;pole,&#8221; while the channel shapes up the &#8220;flag.&#8221; Related Reading: Polkadot Shows Bearish Signal, Analyst Predicts Drawdown To This Target There are also bear flags, which form during periods of downtrend instead. The downward trajectory naturally forms the pole in this case and the flag corresponds to the consolidation towards a slight upside. In the context of the current discussion, the normal bull flag isn&#8217;t of interest, but rather a variant often called a &#8220;pennant&#8221; is. The usual bull flag forms when the consolidation happens between two parallel levels, while a pennant observes the asset moving between converging lines. Here is the chart posted by the analyst that reveals this pattern recently forming in the 4-hour price of Worldcoin: The price appears to have been breaking out of the pattern recently &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X In this pattern, the top line is created by joining together lower highs, while the bottom line connects lower lows. Typically, the asset is probable to feel resistance at the upper level, while the lower level could act as support. A break beyond either of these lines can signal the continuation of the trend. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the 4-hour Worldcoin price had been consolidating inside the pennant channel just recently, but has now seen a break, as its price is surging above the upper level. Such a bullish breakout has generally led to strong uptrends in the past, with the length of the resulting uptrend often being comparable to the pole of the pattern.

WLD Price Worldcoin had broken off toward the $4 level earlier in the past day, but the asset has quickly cooled off as it has already receded to the $3.7 mark. The below chart shows how WLD has performed during the last few days. Had this pullback not taken place, the bullish breakout may well have been confirmed. The coin would have to show some fresh momentum again now if the pattern has to complete. Looks like the asset's recent upwards push was quite short-lived &#124; Source: WLDUSD on TradingView Featured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com"

    "description": "Billionaire Tim Draper has predicted a new all-time high for Bitcoin, foreseeing a staggering $250,000 rise for the cryptocurrency in 2024.  Bitcoin To Reach $250,000 In a recent exclusive interview with Coin Bureau, a crypto informational portal, American venture capital investor, Tim Draper and Co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, Raoul Paul shared compelling insights on the outlook of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the space. Related Reading: Solana Breaks New Record, Will This Send SOL Price To $200? During the engaging conversation, Draper expressed highly bullish sentiments regarding Bitcoin’s future trajectory. When asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin’s price prediction, Draper confidently stated that BTC is poised to reach $250,000 soon. He hinted at the possibility of that surge happening in 2024, due to the present bullish trend on Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. Draper, known for his success in Bitcoin investments also revisited a past Bitcoin projection he made. He stated that he had foreseen Bitcoin reaching $10,000 in three years and true to his foresight, the cryptocurrency achieved the milestone.  “I would say that my number $250,000 will probably come pretty soon, so I’ll stick with $250,000. I think that if it hits $250,000, it’ll go way past it,” Draper stated.  While addressing his $250,000 BTC forecast, Draper also mentioned a prior prediction where he anticipated the price of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 when its value was at $4,000. Despite the non-fulfillment of this particular prediction, Draper hinted at the possibility that the United States’ archaic approach towards cryptocurrencies may be stifling innovation and growth.  “When I predicted that, what I didn’t expect was how fearful and just old thinking the US would be. I think with a receptive US, we would be having conversations like the ones I have with the people from El Salvador,” Draper stated.  Presently, El Salvador is one of the few countries that has accepted Bitcoin as a legal tender. The country became the first to make Bitcoin a legal tender in September 2021, allowing its citizens to utilize BTC as a legal form of payment. BTC bears vie for control &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Draper Unveils Stablecoins Crucial Role In Shaping BTC During the interview, Draper highlighted the role of stablecoins in the crypto space. The billionaire asserted that stablecoins could serve as a valuable support mechanism for BTC due to its price stability and seamless portability. “The role of stablecoins, I think, will be a bridge to bitcoin. I think the way stablecoins will operate, they will be viable as long as the dollar is viable, and then when there’s a run on the dollar, people will move to Bitcoin,” Draper stated.  Related Reading: Why Did The XRP Price Surge To $0.64 Today? The billionaire also expressed a particular interest in smart contracts, highlighting its diverse use cases. He discussed the transformative impacts Bitcoin could bring into the financial sector through smart contracts.  Draper stated: I’m a big fan of smart contracts. I can’t wait for the moment when I can raise all my investor money in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have them all pay their employees and suppliers and their taxes and everything else [in Bitcoin], and have it all be completely accounted for, audited, without an accountant, an auditor, a bookkeeper, a transfer agent, or a tax lawyer. This new economy will have far less friction. I think that’s very exciting.&#8221; Featured image from Experian, chart from Tradingview.com"
