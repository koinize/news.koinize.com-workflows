    "description": "Bitcoin has started out the new week on a rather bearish note after a flash crash sent the price below $69,000 once more. There has since been some recovery in the price of the largest cryptocurrency in the space. However, the damage has already been done as tens of thousands of crypto traders were flushed out of their leveraged positions as a result. 81,000 Crypto Traders Lose $220 Million The Bitcoin flash crash hit support just above $68,800 but crypto traders are already feeling the brunt of the large move. In the last day, more than 81,000 traders have lost their leveraged positions and the volume of their liquidations have piled up.

According to data from Coinglass, the numbers have climbed above 81,400 crypto traders who were liquidated as a result of the crash. In total, over $223 million was also lost during this time from all of the flushed positions. Then, the single largest liquidation took place on the OKX exchange across the ETH-USD-SWAP pair. This trader alone lost $7 million when their position was liquidated. As expected, the majority of the losses have come from long traders, with Coinglass showing a total of 70.01% of the liquidated positions being longs. This means that long liquidation volumes climbed above $156 million during the last 24 hours. The crypto exchange with the largest liquidation volumes was the OKX exchange, accounting for 46.87%, or $104.61 million, of all liquidations. Binance came in second place with 38.72%, or $86.41 million. Meanwhile, Bybit saw the third-largest liquidation volume at 8.4%, or $18.75 million. Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Lead Liquidations Naturally, the crypto assets with the largest liquidation volumes have been Bitcoin and Ethereum, with $36.1 million and $28.98 million. However, meme coins such as Dogecoin and PEPE have seen their own numbers ramp up as well. Dogecoin’s liquidation volumes came out at $10.4 million for the 24-hour period, which put it ahead of Solana with $8.3 million. Then coming up behind Solana is PEPE, with liquidation volumes climbing as high as $7.1 million.

Then, in the 4-hour and 1-hour timeframes, they account for 6.182% and 72.62%, respectively. As for the Bitcoin price, bulls continue to struggle as resistance at $69,500 mounts. The price is currently trading at $69,450 at the time of this writing, with a 1.1% decline in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.
