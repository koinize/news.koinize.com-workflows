He said considerations should still be made about how to protect user anonymity:</p><blockquote>“It is important that we consider the extent to which privacy and anonymity might be preserved and explore the technologies and methods available, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies, to enable such protections in the design of any potential retail CBDC.”</blockquote><p>In his remarks, Steele weighed the benefits and risks of a possible CBDC saying it could promote a “competitive payment environment.”</p><p>On the other hand, a retail CBDC would be directly backed by the Fed and could provide a safer option for consumers during bank runs which could “destabilize private sector lending” according to Steele.</p><p>He pointed to the recent <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/growing-case-crypto-firms-bypass-banks\">banking crisis</a> and said the “access to non-deposit alternatives outside of the banking system may have changed the nature and speed of bank runs.”</p><p>He added the U.S. “has not yet determined whether it will pursue a CBDC” but a Treasury-led group is evaluating the implications of a potential CBDC in the country.</p><p>Steele said the evaluation includes looking over “policy objectives related to global financial leadership, national security, and privacy, illicit finance and financial inclusion.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-central-banks-and-bis-continue-examination-of-ongoing-policy-issues-for-retail-cbdc\"><strong><em>7 central banks and BIS continue examination of ongoing policy issues for retail CBDC</em></strong></a></p><p>On the Fed’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-confirms-july-launch-for-fednow-instant-payment-service\">FedNow instant payments system</a>, Steele thinks having multiple options for payment operations “promotes choice and competition in payments” which he believes will encourage the “development of new payment services and features” along with enhancing payments system resilience.</p><p>FedNow has witnessed political pushback.
