However, the U.S. Department of Justice has since appealed that decision, asking to confine his residence to the territory of the U.S. pending the said sentencing hearing due to Zhao allegedly possessing an “unacceptable risk of flight.”</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/gen-z-nft-ownership-digital-natives/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Gen Z and the NFT: Redefining Ownership for Digital Natives</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/intro-bitcoin-change-your-life/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>A new intro to Bitcoin: The 9-minute read that could change your life</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>In its indictment, the Department of Justice<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-announcing-binance-and-ceo-guilty#:~:text=Binance%20has%20agreed%20to%20plead,International%20Emergency%20Economic%20Powers%20Act.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >noted</a> that, in a few noticeable incidents and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bithumb-in-turmoil-binances-47k-law-requests-axie-players-down-85-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >despite reassurances</a>, Binance facilitated over $1 billion in illicit transactions for Iranian users, the Russian marketplace Hyrdra and cryptocurrency mixer Bestmixer. and it solicited U.S. users without prior registration.
