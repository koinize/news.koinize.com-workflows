The service acted as a fiat-to-crypto payments provider connecting crypto firms with the traditional finance system. At its launch, the platform supported 50 cryptocurrencies, along with fiat payment methods including Visa and Mastercard. The same day, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fca-reiterates-power-to-suspend-or-cancel-crypto-firms-registrations-following-bifinity-concerns\">expressed its concern</a> over Bifinity providing a $36 million convertible loan to NASDAQ-listed crypto investment firm Eqonex. The FCA wrote that due to the investment, certain holders of Bifinity's parent Binance Group, which is unregulated in the U.K., may be considered as beneficiary owners of Eqonex. Binance Connect also serves as the fiat to crypto <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-owned-trust-wallet-adds-buy-option-via-binance-connect\">on-ramp provider</a> for the firm's self-custody Trust wallet. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear Biswappers,<br><br>The Biswap team keeps abreast of the latest DeFi news and aims to inform you right away.<br><br>After a thorough consideration, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@binance</a> has made a difficult decision to disable <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Binance_Connect?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Binance_Connect</a> on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments… <a href=\"https://t.co/HcooyLn4sg\">pic.twitter.com/HcooyLn4sg</a></p>&mdash; Biswap (@Biswap_Dex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Biswap_Dex/status/1691358029914996736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The same month, Binance Australia <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-suspends-aud-services\">suspended fiat services</a>, citing an issue with a third party.
