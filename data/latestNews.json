The Growing Appeal Of Meme Coins The success of PEPE coin signifies the growing influence and appeal of meme-based cryptocurrencies, which often rely heavily on online communities and social media engagement. The enthusiasm surrounding these coins is fueled by a combination of factors, including social trends, speculative trading, and the potential for quick, albeit risky, returns on investment.
