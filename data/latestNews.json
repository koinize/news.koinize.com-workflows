    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink-bullish-chart-pattern-hints-at-34-target-but-can-it-break-through/",
    "description": "As the calendar turned to 2024, numerous cryptocurrencies experienced a positive start, and among them, Chainlink (LINK) stood out. The notable highlight was the emergence of a bullish pattern on Chainlink&#8217;s price chart, indicating a heightened likelihood of an impending bull rally. This positive momentum in the early days of the year hinted at favorable market conditions for Chainlink and garnered attention from investors and analysts alike. The formation of this bullish pattern added an optimistic outlook to the prospects of Chainlink, creating anticipation for potential upward price movements in the near future. Bullish Pennant Signals Potential Breakout For Chainlink The Chainlink platform, which is compatible with Ethereum and well-known for enabling decentralized oracles, is currently trading above $15, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Is Internet Computer (ICP) The Next Big Thing? 60% Jump Raises Eyebrows Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst, pointed out a bullish pennant pattern being formed on Chainlink’s chart. The chart shows Chainlink&#8217;s price over the past few days. There is a bullish pennant pattern forming, which is a technical indicator that suggests a potential breakout to the upside. #Chainlink shows signs of a bull pennant formation. A decisive close above $17.2 could be the catalyst for a breakout, potentially propelling $LINK toward $34. However, keep an eye on the $14.2 level – a drop below this could invalidate the current bullish outlook for #LINK. pic.twitter.com/N9e6peREPn — Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024 The pennant is formed by two converging trend lines, one above and one below the price. The breakout occurs when the price breaks above the upper trend line. Martinez has identified the resistance level at $17.2. If Chainlink&#8217;s price can close above this level, it could be a signal that a breakout is happening and that the price could rise to $34. However, if the price falls below the support level at $14.2, it could be a signal that the bullish momentum is weakening and that the price could fall further. Overall, the chart suggests that Chainlink is in a bullish position and that there is a possibility of a breakout to the upside. However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not always accurate, and there are many other factors that could affect Chainlink&#8217;s price. LINK market cap currently at $8.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Analysts&#8217; LINK Predictions Changelly cryptocurrency analysts have provided a price estimate for Chainlink for the next weekend. The analysts predict that this weekend, LINK will trade between a minimum of $16.28 and a maximum of $17.71. They anticipate that LINK will be valued at $17 on average.

He said the coin will soon witness a significant surge and &#8220;shock the crypto world.&#8221; Davis indicated that the Chainlink network had a promising future. He revealed that he had a sizeable portion of LINK, despite acknowledging the inherent dangers associated with cryptocurrency investing. According to the analyst, Chainlink&#8217;s alliances and technology continue to undervalue it. The Grayscale Trust Trading at premiums exceeding 200% to the spot LINK price, Davis said, indicates that institutional investors are becoming more interested in LINK. The price projection for Chainlink indicates that it may increase to $126 in 2024. Featured image from Shutterstock"
