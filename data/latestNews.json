    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-6000-to-33/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Tyler Strejilevich has speculated what could be another tremendous bullish run for Cardano (ADA). Cardano has already done a 132% gain for its holders since the beginning of the year, but according to a discovery by this analyst, the token might just be getting started. In fact, if Strejilevich is right, ADA could skyrocket by an incredible 6000% from today&#8217;s price to $33 in the next year. Crypto Analyst Tyler Strejilevich Spots Bullish Signal For Cardano Crypto analyst Tyler Strejilevich made his discovery known in a post on the social media platform X. In the post, he noted how ADA is currently at a similar crossroads which it found itself in July 2020.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Vs LUNC Burn: Which One Has Had A Better Impact? Using his analysis of the ADA price chart he shared, Strejilevich noted how the token is now at a bullish cross on moving averages on the weekly timeframe. The last time this happened, ADA went on to form many consecutive bullish candles, going from $0.041 to its current all-time high of $3.09 in 66 weeks.  A repeat would see Cardano reaching $33 by January 2025. A less optimistic prediction by Changelly puts a $1 prediction by the end of 2025.  #ADA is about to get a bullish weekly cross for the first time since JUNE 2020 The last time this happened it pumped 6,000% over the next 66 weeks#cardano pic.twitter.com/xQvvbf3b1O — Tyler Strejilevich (@TylerSCrypto) December 9, 2023 The bullish crossover is yet to happen, and the token still has a few weeks to see how this would play out. Of course, in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, there&#8217;s no guarantee the price will move as predicted. Nevertheless, Cardano is poised for a major rally that could extend into the coming year.  ADA price continues to show strength &#124; Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Current Bullish Performance Of ADA Network activity, increase in DeFi TVL, and other factors point to Cardano continuing on its current bull run. It&#8217;s important to note that the last time Cardano went on this 6000% price gain, its blockchain network was still behind on smart contract functionality. However, the network has changed since then, with Cardano now one of the fastest-growing blockchains in terms of smart contracts.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Short-Term XRP Price Rally To $18 Cardano is currently trading at $0.5754, up by 48.43% in a 7-day timeframe amidst a larger crypto market green week. The crypto briefly touched the $0.6 level on December 9, reaching $0.6323 for the first time this year. It has now formed a minor support at $0.53 and is on its way to revisiting $0.6. On the other hand, the total crypto market cap has dropped by 5.75% in the past 24 hours, as Bitcoin inflows slowed down. According to a chart shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin miners have sold around 1,000 BTC worth $44 million since Friday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down by 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 6% from its yearly high of $44,500. Featured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com"
