Source: OpenChat</em></figcaption></figure><p>OpenChat is a blockchain-based chat app running on the Internet Computer (ICP) network. It facilitates mostly crypto-oriented chat groups, including some with a few thousand members. LootMoneyArmy (3,201 members), Magnetic (2,703 members) and DFinityVN (2,597 members) are some examples of OpenChat groups.</p><p>The app’s development team first <a href=\"https://oc.app/blog/communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the Communities feature in February. At the time, they observed that users were employing OpenChat for different reasons than initially anticipated. While developers originally intended Communities to be used as an instant messaging app similar to WhatsApp or Signal, end-users seemed more interested in using the app to form public groups and build communities.</p><p>While the developers welcomed this interest, they also explained that OpenChat lacked the hierarchical system used in apps like Discord or Slack. This prevented group admins from using it to create subgroups to keep conversation focused on particular topics, ultimately making groups on OpenChat less effective than they otherwise could be. </p><p>The team promised to fix this problem by implementing Communities at some point in the future, making the app more suitable for users interested in joining groups. The new feature would replace the current groups with “communities” and allow admins to create “groups” within these communities, similar to the way Discord has channels within servers. Admins would also be able to make their communities private, giving them a function similar to a Slack group, the post stated.</p><p>The Aug. 2 announcement states that Communities has now launched and is available within the app.</p><p>In a conversation with Cointelegaph, OpenChat co-founder Julian Jeffs said Communities will eventually allow crypto protocols to build communities directly from their own websites, eliminating the need for downloading external programs like Discord or Telegram.</p><p>“One other sort of notable thing on the roadmap that Communities will facilitate is providing integrations to other apps in the ecosystem as well,” Jeffs explained. “There are a lot of other apps that would like to have a chat function within but don’t necessarily want to send their users outside of their website or the app.”</p><p>Jeffs further explained that the team is experimenting with several designs for this future “Communities integration” system. One concept is to provide a “server-to-server synchronization” between OpenChat and each project, while another option is to create a set of front-end components that projects could “drop in” to their interfaces. Either way, the integration would allow users of Web3 protocols to chat with other users and get technical support from admins without needing to navigate away from the apps they are using.</p><p>The team stressed that the “integrations” feature will not be a part of Communities at launch but is planned to be implemented in a later patch.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-web3-id-app-lets-users-find-each-other-based-on-proven-interests\"><strong>New Web3 ID app lets users find each other based on proven interests</strong></a></em></p><p>Discord and Telegram are the two most widely used messaging apps in the crypto community, but these Web2 platforms don’t allow users to post messages using their Web3 identities. This can lead to users getting scammed by persons claiming to be holders of wallets they don’t actually control. </p><p>OpenChat is one project trying to solve this problem. Another example is Grill.chat, which runs on a Polkadot chain but <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/subsocial-chat-program-implements-ethereum-usernames-polygon-donations\">allows Ethereum wallet holders to chat</a> using their Ethereum usernames. Coinbase wallet’s new messaging feature <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-wallet-launches-instant-messaging-feature-with-xmtp\">is another example</a> of the growing movement to allow wallet-based chat.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-chat-app-icp-launches-communities-compete-with-discord&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"nifty_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "<p>A congressional committee in the United States is currently investigating asset management firm BlackRock for its role in facilitating investments into Chinese companies that the U.S. government has blacklisted.&nbsp;</p>\nRetirement Funds Tied to Blacklisted Chinese Firms\n<p>Lawmakers have expressed concern that Americans' retirement funds are unknowingly being funneled into Chinese firms flagged for security and human rights issues, and they believe BlackRock has been involved in this process. The House of Representatives Select Committee on the CCP has notified BlackRock about the investigations, with the intention of gathering facts to inform U.S. policies on capital flows to China. According to the committee, the massive influx of American capital into these Chinese entities further exacerbates national security threats and undermines American values.</p>\n<p>The committee has claimed that the firm has facilitated the investment of over $429 million across five funds in such blacklisted Chinese companies. The committee has raised concerns over the scope of these investments, suggesting that the true scale may be much larger.</p>\nBlackRock's Response\n<p>In response to the allegations, BlackRock has denied any wrongdoing. The firm stated that it complies with all applicable U.S. government laws in its investments, both in China and markets around the world. The investment firm, which manages over $9 billion of assets, expressed its willingness to engage directly with the Select Committee regarding the issues raised.</p>\n<p>The news of the investigation has impacted BlackRock's stock, with shares down 0.8% in mid-afternoon trade, underperforming the main stock indexes.</p>\nThe Broader U.S.-China Tensions\n<p>This investigation is just one example of the wider implications of the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. As these tensions continue, U.S. companies are facing challenges in their operations and investments related to China.</p>\n<p>The impact of the investigation is not limited to BlackRock alone. Other asset management firms like Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and WisdomTree also have funds or ETFs with Chinese assets. However, these firms have not yet responded to requests for comment on their investments.</p>\n<p>The Select Committee, led by Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Democrat Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, holds significant power in making policy recommendations and can subpoena executives and officials. While it has not used this authority until now, Representative Gallagher had previously stated his intention to issue subpoenas for uncooperative executives.</p>\n<p>As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how BlackRock and other asset managers with Chinese investments will navigate the complexities of U.S.-China relations and comply with the committee's inquiries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-prediction-shibarium-trend-reversal/",
    "description": "In recent weeks, the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has shown signs of recuperation, gradually recovering from its yearly low of $0.00000597, reached on June 10. SHIB was following the pawprints of its rival, Dogecoin (DOGE), which recently garnered momentum following a profile update from Elon Musk. As the value of SHIB began to move upward, anticipation around the forthcoming release of Shibarium, a layer 2 solution, also began to ripple through the investor community. The announcement that Shibarium will be unveiled at the Blockchain Futurist Conference held from August 15-16, 2023, in Canada, ignited a flicker of optimism. However, there is still no clear confirmation for a trend reversal from a technical perspective for SHIB. Can Shiba Inu Finally Enter Bullish Territory? While DOGE has already breached the threshold of the 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) &#8211; a widely respected metric in chart analysis &#8211; SHIB has yet to break through this key technical indicator. In simplified terms, an asset above the 200-day line indicates an uptrend, while trading below suggests a downtrend. Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens A classical approach would recognize a strong buy signal when the price moves from below to above the trend line. Investors with an eye on SHIB continue to await for this buy signal. This is despite the meme coin currently trading 55% higher compared to its low on June 10. Remarkably, the recent positive price trend did enable SHIB to ascend beyond the 50-day EMA (orange), a modest victory in its own right. At the moment, SHIB faces an uphill battle against the 100-day EMA, priced at $0.00000840. As of press time, Shiba Inu traded just shy of this mark, at $0.00000830. Another bullish argument is that the meme coin recently broke out of the ascending triangle formation that had held it captive since mid-June. SHIB should not fall back below the formation&#8217;s former resistance at $0.00000831 to confirm the breakout. Remarkably, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level is also at this level, making this price twice as important. If Shiba Inu can maintain its current position and use the 23.6% Fibonacci level as support, it could successfully break above the horizontal resistance around $0.00000870. Then, a subsequent jump to the bullish boundary &#8211; the 200-day EMA at $0.00000933 &#8211; could be on the cards. Should SHIB bulls accomplish this feat, the price would technically trigger a buy signal. This could potentially pave the way for a further surge, with the next resistance looming at the 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00000976. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump At this point, substantial selling pressure can be expected, given that this price level functioned as strong support from early March to early May this year. Additional price targets are the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00001093 and the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.00001209. A bearish scenario would be triggered if SHIB fails to sustain the breakout above $0.00000831 on the 1-day chart. A drop to the previous month&#8217;s low of $0.00000709 could be in the offing. Holding this price level will be critical to avoid revisiting the year&#8217;s low at $0.00000597. Yet, with the much-anticipated launch of Shibarium less than a month away, this bearish scenario appears less probable. The question that investors are grappling with: Will Shibarium be the catalyst that finally signals a trend reversal for Shiba Inu? Only time will reveal the answer.
