A simple request for flights from Melbourne and Tokyo on a particular day returned options with major carriers like Qantas and Japan Airlines, which is probably what many people would be after.</p><p>Bard was then able to further refine the results to cheapest direct flight, with seat selection, a minimum 15 kilograms of luggage and a meal, finding an Air Asia flight from Melbourne to Osaka that was cheaper than the one Id booked to Tokyo.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Air-Asia-X-849x1024.jpg\" alt=\"AirAsia X \" class=\"wp-image-21517\" width=\"392\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Air-Asia-X-849x1024.jpg 849w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Air-Asia-X-249x300.jpg 249w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Air-Asia-X-770x929.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Air-Asia-X.jpg 869w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bard found a very good value flight after the search query was refined. </em></figcaption></figure><p>The AI was also pretty good at determining the seat width, pitch and recline angle for the Air Asia flight to work out if actually flying with the airline was going to be a nightmare.</p><p>Overall pretty impressive, though its unable to provide a link to book that particular flight. I checked, however, and the prices and details on the site matched.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, ChatGPT was a total fail, despite its new Kayak travel agent plugin. It offered me a 29-hour flight via Atlanta and Detroit, which is about three times as long as a direct flight would take. And while there are plenty of direct flights available, it insisted there were none. As it’s a U.S.-focused site, your mileage may vary.</p><p>In terms of hotels, the Kayak plugin won but only by default. Prompted to find an affordable double room in Shibuya with a review score above 7, it suggested the Shinagawa Prince Hotel for $155 a night and provided a direct link to book it. It turned out the hotel was an hours walk from Shibuya, and none of the other options were located in Shibuya either.</p><p>This was still an order of magnitude better than Bard, which suggested the Hotel Gracery Shibuya at $120 a night. The only problem is that no such hotel exists.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hotel-Gracery-Shibuya-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Fake hotel\" class=\"wp-image-21513\" width=\"389\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hotel-Gracery-Shibuya.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hotel-Gracery-Shibuya-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hotel-Gracery-Shibuya-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hotel-Gracery-Shibuya-770x770.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bing Image Creator was able to generate a nice pic of the fake Hotel Gracery Shibuya. </em></figcaption></figure><p>It then offered the Shibuya Excel Hotel at $100 per night, but the actual cost was $220 a night when I tried to book. After I pointed this out, Bard apologized profusely and again suggested the non-existent Hotel Gracery Shibuya.</p><p>Frustrated, I gave up and asked Bard for a transcript of our conversation to help write this column.</p><p>Hilariously, Bard provided a totally fictional transcript of our conversation in which the AI successfully booked me into the nonexistent Hotel Gracery Shibuya at $100 a night, with the reservation number 123456789. The hallucinated transcript ended with the fake me being delighted with Bards superlative performance:</p><p><strong>User:</strong> <em>Thank you, Bard, that was very helpful.</em></p><p><strong>Bard: </strong><em>Youre welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?</em></p><p><strong>User: </strong><em>No, thats all. Thanks again.</em></p><p><strong>Bard:</strong> <em>You’re welcome.

The Glassnode analytics firm noted that<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-send-record-inflows-to-exchanges\"> miners sent an all-time high in BTC revenue</a> percentage to exchanges over the past week, totaling $128 million. Curiously, the movement mimics spikes seen during the 2021 bull run as miners took profits.</p><p>Additionally, during the European Central Bank forum in Portugal, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-powell-speech-amd-stock-nvidia-slide-on-ai-chip-ban-to-china/?src=A00220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">warned</a> that most policymakers expect two more rate hikes this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors are pricing in 82% odds of a 25 basis point interest rate increase on July 26.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/e466390d-be94-41e6-aebf-57ca364ee65d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin four-hour price movements during option expiries. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bitcoin price last flirted with the $31,000 level on June 27, but the resistance proved stronger than anticipated. The subsequent correction to $30,000 supports the thesis of sideways trading in the short term as investors evaluate the impacts of additional interest rate increases by the Fed.</p><p>Such a restrictive scenario for the global economy might explain why some Bitcoin traders decided to take profits, which limited the price upside.</p><h2>$4.7 billion out of reach as bulls were too optimistic</h2><p>The open interest for the June 30 options expiry is $4.7 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were expecting $32,000 or higher price levels. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin’s price rallied 25.5% between June 15 and June 23, testing the $31,000 resistance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/84fd13f1-2285-442d-8ffd-d0603e82028f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Deribit <em>Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 30. Source: Deribit</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $3.1 million in call (buy) open interest and the $1.7 million in put (sell) options. </p><p>But if Bitcoin’s price remains near $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 30, only $630 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.</p><h2>Bitcoin bears aim for sub-$30,000 to balance the scales</h2><p>Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 30 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.</p><ul><li><strong>Between $28,000 and $29,000:</strong> 7,200 calls vs. 16,200 puts. Bears in control, profiting $250 million.</li><li><strong>Between $29,000 and $30,000:</strong> 13,000 calls vs. 12,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.</li><li><strong>Between $30,000 and $31,000: </strong>1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $440 million.</li><li><strong>Between $31,000 and $32,000:</strong> 3,300 calls vs. 800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $670 million.</li></ul><p>This crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.</p><p>For instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to estimate this effect.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-30k-support-springboard\">Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls?</a></em></strong></p><p>Consequently, it will come down to whether BTC price bears are willing to risk exposure while a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval is being analyzed by the SEC. </p><p>Although it is impossible to estimate the potential inflow or the timing of such an event, it paves the way for bulls to secure a $440 million profit by keeping Bitcoin price above $30,000 in the short term.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
