Traders now question whether the recovery was backed by solid fundamentals and whether or not SOL can push back above $90.</p><p>Part of the movement can be attributed to the recently <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/token-extensions-on-solana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">launched</a> 'token extensions' on the Solana network, which allow confidential transfers to hide balances, transfer hooks for gated access, and the ability to charge fees at the protocol level. These updates were included in the v.1.17 release of the Solana Labs validator client announced on Jan. 19. The plug-and-play functionalities are designed for enterprise applications and regulator-friendly resources.</p><p>Another source of optimism comes from Firedancer, a promising new third-party validator client currently under development.
