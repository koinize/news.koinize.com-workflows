While rival Microsoft has jumped on the ChatGPT bandwagon and is integrating AI into everything despite the bugs and hallucinations, the acronym didnt even get a mention at Apples Worldwide Developers Conference in June.</p><p>Reports emerged in July, however, that Apple was working on its own generative AI tool, dubbed internally “Apple GPT,” which uses a large language model (LLM) framework called Ajax. On this weeks quarterly earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said Apple was enthusiastic about the technology and has incorporated AI into forthcoming iOS17 features like Personal Voice (voice cloning and text-to-speech) and Live Voicemail (live transcription). He added:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Weve been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI, for years. Were going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies, with the goal of enriching peoples lives. Thats what its all about for us. As you know, we tend to announce things as they come to market, thats our M.O., and Id like to stick to that.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, what everyday users want to know is whether Siri will be getting an AI upgrade. And they certainly appear to be working on it, with the Financial Times reporting that Apple is hiring dozens of researchers and engineers to work on compressing existing language models so they can run efficiently on mobile devices, rather than in the cloud.” The ads indicated the company is fully focused on bringing LLM technology to mobiles.</p><p><strong><em>Also read:</em> <em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-human-digital-souls-agi-alignment-problem-replika/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Experts want to give AI human souls so they dont kill us all</a></em></strong></p><p>There are speed, privacy and security reasons to run the AI locally on the phone hardware rather than in the cloud, given concerns over OpenAI and Claude hoovering up all your personal and business data.

    "description": "<p>In a major decision taken on the 8th of August, Bitstamp has announced that it would suspend trading for several cryptocurrencies identified as securities by the SEC in cases against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The impacted tokens will no longer be available to trade by the end of August.&nbsp;</p>\nBitstamp Moves To Suspend Tokens&nbsp;\n<p>According to the announcement, several prominent cryptocurrencies will soon be blocked, rendering US-based users unable to trade them. These include Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), Near Protocol (NEAR), Polygon (MATIC), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL). As per the company&rsquo;s announcement, after delisting the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, the platform will offer only 30 listed cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency exchange urged users to execute all trades involving these tokens by the 29th of August, following which they will become unavailable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Update for our US users Starting the 29th of August: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>According to the exchange, US trading of the tokens will be permanently disabled after the 29th of August. However, customers can still withdraw and hold the tokens after the date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We kindly request our users to promptly execute any desired buy or sell orders involving the affected assets before the 29th of August, 2023. After this deadline, trading activities related to AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL will be permanently disabled on the Bitstamp platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n&ldquo;Recent Developments&rdquo; Led To Decision&nbsp;\n<p>The announcement pointed at recent market developments as the reason behind the suspension of trading of the cryptocurrencies mentioned. While the firm did not provide a concrete reason, all of the tokens mentioned in the announcement have been alleged to be unregistered securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission identified the cryptocurrencies in question as unregistered securities in separate complaints against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, Bitstamp has not delisted other assets mentioned in the cases against Binance and Coinbase. These assets include Nexo (NEXO), Algorand (ALGO), and Cardano (ADA).&nbsp;</p>\nOther Platforms Have Also Delisted Assets&nbsp;\n<p>The allegations against the tokens made by the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to be proven in a court of law. However, other platforms have voluntarily delisted specific assets mentioned by the SEC in the cases. In recent months, several platforms, including Bakkt, Robinhood, and Revolut, have delisted Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The platforms seem to have delisted these three cryptocurrencies because they are among the largest assets which the SEC targets. Following the developments, projects such as The Sandbox have also started mandating Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for SAND staking. According to the SEC, a total of 68 cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>\nCrypto Projects Reject Claims&nbsp;\n<p>However, cryptocurrency projects have repeatedly rejected the claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, either directly or indirectly. The Solana Foundation, in a statement, has said that it categorically disagrees with the SEC&rsquo;s observations. Cardano&rsquo;s parent company IOHK has also denied ADA&rsquo;s security status. Meanwhile, Polygon Labs has said its operations were focused outside the US, beyond the reach and jurisdiction of the SEC.
