    "description": "Bitcoin price remains stagnant for going on months now, with no clear trend developing and volatility in a downward spiral. However, some subtle signs are popping up that could suggest that a bullish Bitcoin trend is beginning to take shape. Make Friends With Strong Trends ‚ÄúThe trend is your friend‚Äù is one of the most famous trading quotes, highlighting how capturing as much of the prevailing trend as possible can lead to the most profitable results. For this reason, in technical analysis, trend-following tools are among the most successful. But what is an investor or trader to do when there is a clear absence of any discernible trend? The answer is ‚Äúto wait for the trend to appear‚Äù but that‚Äôs easier said than done. This is why specific tools have been created to tell when assets like Bitcoin or even stocks are trending or not. One such tool is starting to rise after several weeks of sideways price action, and it suggest that the underlying trend is strengthening. The Average Directional Index &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bullish Bitcoin Is Building Muscle The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a trend strength measuring tool, created by the father of technical indicators, J. Welles, Wilder, Jr. Other tools Wilder built include the Parabolic SAR, Average True Range, and the Relative Strength Index. A reading above 20 on the ADX means a trend is developing. The more it turns up, the stronger the trend. After weeks of sideways, the trend is starting to strengthen again. The tool also includes two Directional Movement indicators, the DI+ and DI-. The DI+ is currently above the DI-, showing that bulls in control of the underlying price action. All that‚Äôs left is for the ADX to strengthen further and Bitcoin could finally break out of this range and begin trending. What Bitcoin bulls ultimately want to see next is for the ADX to grow even steeper, similar to what we can see in late 2020 and into early 2022. The lack of another strong trend at the second 2021 peak was a warning that something was off. Will the bullish trend continue to strengthen, or will bears regain control? #Bitcoin 1W Average Directional Index is turning back up above 20 ‚Äî this is the signature of a strengthening trend DI+ is above DI- which shows bulls are in control Trend-following tools may soon prove more useful with a trend growing pic.twitter.com/9nAUEVIcL3 &#8212; Tony &#34;The Bull&#34; (@tonythebullBTC) August 14, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chiliz-chz-empowers-smart-contracts-with-upgrades-positive-impact-on-price/",
    "description": "Chiliz, the pioneering sports blockchain platform, is set to make waves once again as it teases forthcoming upgrades to its smart contracts. In a recent tweet, Chiliz unveiled its plans to enhance the functionality of its smart contracts, showcasing the company&#8217;s ongoing commitment to providing a seamless and efficient experience for its users.¬† Chiliz has been a trailblazer in the sports and entertainment industry, utilizing blockchain technology to bridge the gap between sports fans and their favorite teams. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Co-Founder Labels BTC Maximalists As ‚ÄòInsecure Losers‚Äô The platform&#8217;s innovative approach allows fans to engage with their chosen teams through fan tokens, gaining access to exclusive content, rewards, and even influencing certain team decisions through token-based voting systems.¬† üó≥Ô∏è Upcoming Proposals: Upgrading the Smart contracts Upgrade 1: Upgrading the contracts to allow factory contracts to deploy without being whitelisted as deployers. The factory contract will still need to be deployed by a whitelisted deployer.#ChilizGovernance ‚ö° $CHZ pic.twitter.com/zyBTqzAhTJ ‚Äî Chiliz ($CHZ) &#8211; Powering Socios.com ‚ö° (@Chiliz) August 14, 2023 As the platform gears up for these improvements, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether these upgrades will play a role in boosting the price of CHZ, Chiliz&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. Chiliz Upgrades On The Horizon The first of the upcoming upgrades focuses on streamlining the deployment of factory contracts. In a bid to improve efficiency, Chiliz plans to enable such contracts to be deployed without the need for whitelisting as deployers.¬† This move is expected to simplify the process while maintaining a level of security by ensuring that the factory contract is still initiated by a whitelisted deployer. By reducing friction in the contract deployment process, Chiliz aims to enhance user experience and attract a wider range of participants. The second upgrade revolves around staking pool contract enhancements. Chiliz aims to address issues related to the accuracy of voting power displayed for validators and the calculation of delegated amounts.¬† Chiliz is currently trading at $0.0748. Chart by TradingView.com To rectify this, the Chiliz team has indicated that a temporary downtime for the delegated and undelegated features will be necessary during the upgrade. While this may temporarily inconvenience users, the improvements are anticipated to provide a more accurate and transparent staking experience. Impact On CHZ Price As Chiliz enthusiasts eagerly await these upgrades, the impact on the price of CHZ remains a topic of interest. At the time of writing, CHZ is in the red in all timeframes, and priced at $0.074903 according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have seen a decline of 1.2% in its value, while the past seven days have witnessed a decline of 1.5%. These fluctuations underscore the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. CHZ price action today.
