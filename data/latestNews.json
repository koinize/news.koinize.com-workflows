In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretences.</p>\n\nCFTC Alleges a Fraud Scheme\n<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Mashinsky and Celsius of participating in a &ldquo;scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.&rdquo; The complaint adds despite worsening market conditions, Celsius continued to &ldquo;promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The regulator further alleges Celsius violated several federal commodities regulations, failed to register as a Commodity Pool Operator, engaged in fraud, and did not provide sufficient disclosure documents.</p>\n<p>Investigators from the CFTC previously concluded that Mashinsky and Celsius violated several US laws.</p>\nSEC Accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of Securities Fraud\n<p>In a separate lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mashinsky and the firm of securities fraud. According to the SEC, CEL and Celsius&rsquo; Earn product are securities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges:</p>\n\n<p>In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program.</p>\n\nFTC Announces $4.7 Billion Settlement With Celsius\n<p>The barrage of claims against Celsius and its former CEO further included a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint.</p>\n<p>The FTC said Celsius violated the Federal Trade Commission Act &ldquo;in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The commission said:</p>\n\n<p>Defendants assured customers that Celsius maintained sufficient reserves to meet customer obligations.</p>\n\n<p>However, the FTC reached a settlement agreement with Celsius &ldquo;that will permanently ban it from handling customers&rsquo; assets&rdquo; and prohibits it from &ldquo;offering, marketing, or promoting any product or services that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest or withdraw any assets.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Celsius has agreed to a $4.7 billion judgement which will only be paid after creditors and investors have been repaid in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Customer Protection, commented on Celsius's alleged conduct, saying:</p>\n\n<p>Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s action banning Celsius from handling people&rsquo;s money and holding its executives accountable should make clear that emerging technologies are not above the law.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
