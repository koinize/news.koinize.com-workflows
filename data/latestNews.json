On the other hand, securities enjoy the benefits of corporate earnings and eventual government subsidies, so perhaps investors should be concerned by the recent price drop from Ether.</p><h2>Ether price pressured succumbs to regulation and lowered network activity</h2><p>Regulatory pressure helped to subdue investors’ appetite for Ether as the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/requiring-dexes-to-register-with-sec-like-other-exchanges-is-impossible-says-coinbase-clo\">(SEC) proposed a rule change</a> regarding the definition of an exchange. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of the Coinbase exchange, has pushed back against the proposed change, claiming that it violates the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p>More concerningly, decentralized applications (Dapps) usage on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum despite gas fees plummeting by 75%. The 7-day average transaction cost dropped to $4 on June 14, down from $16 one month prior. Meanwhile, Dapps active addresses declined by 18% in the same period.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/1812ffec-44df-4286-b90f-97c3c4175945.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice that the decline happened across the board, affecting decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT marketplaces, gaming and collectibles alike. Curiously, the total value locked (TVL), which measures the deposits locked in Ethereum's smart contracts, declined by a mere 2% versus mid-May to 14.6 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.</p><p>To analyze the odds of Ether’s price breaking below the $1,650 support, one should check for a reduced ETH futures premium and increased costs for protective put options.</p><p>Ether<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-derivatives\"> quarterly futures</a> are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.</p><p>As a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/9099702d-b7e7-4b72-be56-7016f2b7eeab.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ether 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas</em></figcaption></figure><p>According to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 2%, the indicator remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.</p><p>To exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/25c9266e-233b-4c57-be8b-f6e48f048f00.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ether 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas</em></figcaption></figure><p>The skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew. As displayed above, the delta skew has been signaling fear since June 10 and peaked at 21% on June 15 — the highest level in three months.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today\"><strong><em>Here’s what happened in crypto today</em></strong></a></p><h2>Ether’s price looks poised to drop down to $1,560</h2><p>Investors tend to focus solely on short-term price movements and forget that Ether’s price is up 37% year-to-date in 2023. Moreover, by relying too much on Ethereum Network's $24 billion total value locked (TVL), traders might have missed the signals of weakening demand for Dapps use.</p><p>For now, bears have the upper hand considering the ETH derivatives metrics, so a retest of the $1,560 support is the most likely outcome. That does not mean that the 2023 gains are at risk, but until the regulatory FUD dissipates, bulls will have a hard time moving Ether above the $1,750 resistance.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Previous efforts to use massive troves of audio data have resulted in severely degraded audio outputs. For this reason, most TTS systems use small, highly-curated, labelled datasets. </p><p>Meta overcomes this limitation through a novel training scheme that ditches labels and curation for an architecture capable of “in-filling” audio information. </p><p>As Meta AI put in a June 16 <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>, Voicebox is the “first model that can generalize to speech-generation tasks it was not specifically trained to accomplish with state-of-the-art performance.”</p><p>This makes it possible for Voicebox to translate text to speech, remove unwanted noise by synthesizing replacement speech, and even apply a speaker’s voice to different language outputs. </p><p>According to an accompanying research paper published by Meta, its pre-trained Voicebox system can <a href=\"https://scontent.ftij2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/351115037_821695399385346_5760299707145339818_n.pdf?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=41HlMFkgcfgAX802dZT&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.ftij2-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfAyLKJwd82NUPPfiBr5y7pjfmoP1yGeiHwhq3Bi-16srw&amp;oe=64925FD1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accomplish</a> all of this using only the desired output text and a three-second audio clip.</p><p>The arrival of robust speech-generation comes at particular sensitive time as social media companies continue to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-crypto-community-goes-offline-here-s-why\">struggle with moderation</a> and, in the U.S., a looming presidential election threatens to once again test the limits of online misinformation detection. </p><p>Former U.S. president Donald Trump, for example, currently faces allegations that he mishandled confidential government materials after leaving office. Among the purported evidence <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/trump-tape-classified-document-iran-milley/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">cited</a> in the case against him are audio recordings wherein he allegedly admitted to potential wrongdoing. </p><p>While there’s currently no indication that the former president intends to deny the content described in the audio files, his case illustrates that data integrity resides at the core of the U.S. legal system and, by extension, its democracy. </p><p>Voicebox isn’t the first tool of its kind, but it appears to be among the most robust. As such, Meta’s developed a tool for determining if speech was generated by it which the company claims can “trivially detect” the difference between real and fake audio. Per the blog post: </p><blockquote>“As with other powerful new AI innovations, we recognize that this technology brings the potential for misuse and unintended harm. In our paper, we detail how we built a highly effective classifier that can distinguish between authentic speech and audio generated with Voicebox to mitigate these possible future risks.”</blockquote><p>In the cryptocurrency world, AI has become as integral to day-to-day operations for most businesses as the internet or electricity. The largest exchanges rely on AI chatbots for customer interactions and sentiment analysis, and trading bots have become commonplace. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bybit-plugs-into-chatgpt-for-ai-powered-trading-tools\"><strong><em>Bybit plugs into ChatGPT for AI-powered trading tools</em></strong></a></p><p>The advent of robust text-to-speech systems such as Voicebox, combined with automated trading, could help bridge a gap for would-be cryptocurrency traders who rely on TTS systems that, currently, may struggle with crypto jargon or multi-lingual support.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bullish-momentum-rise-to-27200/",
    "description": "Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride recently, with sudden price drops and spikes keeping investors on their toes. Last week, the cryptocurrency failed to break through its $27,500 resistance level and dropped to a low of $24,700.  However, Bitcoin has again shown signs of regaining its bullish momentum, with a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and trading at $26,400 at the time of writing. Many analysts have predicted a continuation of the uptrend in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, which has been ongoing since January 2023. Related Reading: Curve (CRV) Observes 7% Bounce As Short Squeeze Occurs Bearish Momentum Fades As Bitcoin Retests $26,500 According to Glassnode co-founder Yan Allemann, the current stage in this trend is the retesting of the $26,200 level as bearish momentum fades.  Allemann believes that this is an important stage, as it will determine whether Bitcoin can break through its previous resistance and move toward the next target of $27,200 However, while Bitcoin is showing signs of regaining its bullish momentum, it&#8217;s important to recognize that it is still fragile at this level. Therefore, building confidence among investors is crucial to sustaining Bitcoin&#8217;s upward trend. On a positive note, BlackRock&#8217;s recent application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its new exchange-traded fund (ETF) has given Bitcoin holders and bulls hope.  As reported by NewsBTC, the recent announcement of BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has the potential to impact BTC’s price significantly. If approved, this ETF would enable a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which could drive up demand and ultimately increase its price. ETFs provide a convenient way for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, creating a new demand avenue for the cryptocurrency. This could increase buying pressure and a potential surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Potential BTC Reversal From Support Bitcoin has recently bounced from its bullish trend and the top of its range, indicating that it still has some work to do before establishing a sustainable upward trend.  According to market analyst Crypto Con, one of the most accurate indicators of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish or bearish momentum is the 140-day moving average (MA), which shows that BTC’s price is below this crucial level. The 140DMA is a widely followed indicator in the cryptocurrency market, as it clearly signals whether Bitcoin is in a bullish or bearish phase.  When BTC’s price is above the 140DMA, it&#8217;s a bullish signal, indicating that the cryptocurrency will likely continue its upward trend. Conversely, when the price is below the 140DMA, it&#8217;s a bearish signal, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will likely experience a downward trend. Bitcoin&#8217;s price is below the 140DMA, indicating that it&#8217;s in a bearish phase. However, Crypto Con hopes the cryptocurrency will experience a huge reversal from this support level, leading to a bearish fakeout of the 140DMA. This strong bullish signal could indicate that Bitcoin is ready to continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Developer Unveils Shibacals, Advancing Shibarium Development As BlackRock&#8217;s potential Bitcoin ETF gains attention and BTC gradually regains its bullish momentum, investors are increasingly optimistic that Bitcoin&#8217;s bottom is already behind. There is a growing belief that the largest cryptocurrency in the market is poised to reach new annual highs in 2023 and possibly even surpass its all-time high. However, for BTC to continue its upward trend, the cryptocurrency needs to maintain its current level of $26,000 throughout the weekend. A sustained price above this price mark could indicate that BTC is on track for a green week in the coming days. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com "
