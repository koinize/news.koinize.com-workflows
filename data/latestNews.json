According to Pompliano&#8217;s post, the US government may face a $1.6 trillion annual interest payment by December, should the Federal Reserve persist with its current monetary policies. This projection has ignited speculation among market observers, with suggestions pointing to a scenario that heralded inflation in the US economy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Spread “Buy The Dip” As BTC Plunges Below $66,000 Notably, Bitcoin is emerging as a focal point in discussions, touted by some as a potential hedge against inflation and a contender for the future standard of currency if the US dollar falters.

I will keep stacking #Bitcoin to hedge against this mess. — Not Larry Fink (@NotLarryFink) April 1, 2024 Insights And Bitcoin&#8217;s Varied Perceptions Meanwhile, during a recent feature on CNBC&#8217;s Squawk Box, Anthony Pompliano delved into the multifaceted nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s role in the financial landscape. He highlighted the varied perceptions of Bitcoin among different market participants, ranging from a &#8220;speculative asset&#8221; to a &#8220;hedge against inflation and store of value.&#8221; Pompliano underscored the distinction between investors seeking short-term gains through spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and those adopting Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against inflation. Bitcoin provides hope &#38; protection for anyone. The US dollar has lost 25% of its purchasing power in 4 years, while bitcoin has gained over 800%. We are watching a global store of value be adopted. Here is my full segment on @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com/XvO0B4yE0o — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) April 1, 2024 Drawing on global examples, Pompliano elucidated how individuals in different regions, such as Nigeria and Argentina, are leveraging on buying BTC and stablecoins, respectively, reflecting diverse strategies in response to economic circumstances. Pompliano noted: You don&#8217;t have to go to emerging market to find out why people want to buy this. If you look at the United States Dollar it has lost 20% of its purchasing power since 2020, Bitcoin is up 800% during that same time period. Bitcoin Recent Performance It is worth noting that despite recent market volatility, characterized by Bitcoin&#8217;s notable decline over the past week, Pompliano&#8217;s remarks shed light on Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and potential for future growth. Notably, Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback, losing nearly 10% of its value over the week and further declining by 6% in the past 24 hours alone. Its current market price hovers around $65,234. Market analysts attribute this downturn to diminishing expectations of Federal Reserve interventions and waning demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as highlighted in a Bloomberg report.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscale-drops-bombshell-report-crypto-bull-run-progresses-to-middle-phase-future-outlook-detailed/",
    "description": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge after a prolonged bear market and the intensified crypto winter caused by the collapse of crypto exchanges and firms during 2022 and part of 2023.  Notably, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial price surges, accompanied by renewed interest from institutional investors entering the market through recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Adding to the industry&#8217;s positive outlook, asset manager and Bitcoin ETF issuer, Grayscale, believes that the current state of the market indicates that the industry is in the &#8220;middle&#8221; stages of a crypto bull run.  Grayscale recently released a comprehensive report detailing their key findings and insights into what lies ahead. A closer analysis of the report by market expert Miles Deutscher sheds light on the factors contributing to this assessment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Major Roadblock As Whales Go On Massive Selling Spree On-Chain Metrics And Institutional Demand Grayscale&#8217;s report starts by highlighting several key signals indicating that the market is currently in the middle of a bull run. These include Bitcoin&#8217;s price surpassing its all-time high before the Halving event, the total crypto market cap reaching its previous peak, and the growing attention from traditional finance (TradFi) towards meme coins. To understand how long this rally might sustain, Grayscale emphasizes two specific price drivers: spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and strong on-chain fundamentals. Grayscale notes that nearly $12 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in just three months, indicating significant “pent-up” retail demand. Moreover, ETF inflows have consistently exceeded BTC issuance, creating upward price pressure due to the demand-supply imbalance. Grayscale&#8217;s research focuses on three critical on-chain metrics: stablecoin inflows, decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), and BTC outflows from exchanges. According to Deutscher, the increase in stablecoin supply on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by approximately 6% between February and March suggests enhanced liquidity, making more capital readily available for trading. Furthermore, for the analyst, the doubling of the total value locked into DeFi since 2023 represents growing user engagement, increased liquidity, and improved user experience within the DeFi ecosystem. The outflows from exchanges, which currently account for about 12% of BTC&#8217;s circulating supply (the lowest in five years), indicate rising investor confidence in BTC&#8217;s value and a preference for holding rather than selling. Based on these catalysts, Grayscale asserts that the market is in the &#8220;mid-phase&#8221; of the bull run, likening it to the &#8220;5th inning&#8221; in baseball.  Promising Outlook For Crypto Industry Several key metrics support Grayscale’s analysis, including the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, which indicates that investors who bought BTC at lower prices continue to hold despite rising prices.  According to Deutscher, the Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, currently at 3, implies that there is still room for growth in this cycle. Additionally, the ColinTalksCrypto Bitcoin Bull Run Index (CBBI), which integrates multiple ratios, currently stands at 79/100, suggesting that the market is approaching historical cycle peaks with some upward momentum remaining.  Related Reading: Ethereum And Altcoins Crash: Why Is This Analyst Super Bullish? Furthermore, retail interest has yet to fully return this cycle, as evidenced by lower cryptocurrency YouTube subscription rates and reduced Google Trends interest for &#8220;crypto&#8221; compared to the previous cycle. Ultimately, Grayscale retains a &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; stance regarding the future of this bull cycle, given the promising signals and analysis outlined in their report.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-supply-loss-hits-10-crash-happened-time/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin supply in profit has plunged following the latest crash in the asset&#8217;s price towards the $65,000 level. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Is Now Down To Around 90% As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, around 10% of the BTC supply is now in a state of loss. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the &#8220;Percent Supply in Profit,&#8221; which tracks the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply holding an unrealized gain. This metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin in circulation to see the price at which it was last transferred. Assuming that this previous transaction involved a change of hands, the price at its moment would serve as the cost basis for the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Spread “Buy The Dip” As Bitcoin Plunges Below $66,000 The coins with a cost basis that is less than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency would naturally be considered to be holding a profit, and as such, they would be counted under the supply in profit. The Percent Supply in Profit adds up all such coins and calculates what part of the total supply they make up for. The opposite metric, the Percent Supply in Loss, adds up the coins not satisfying this condition. Since the total circulating supply must add up to 100%, the Percent Supply in Loss can be deduced from the Percent Supply in Profit by subtracting its value from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Percent Supply in Profit for Bitcoin over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has taken a plunge in recent days &#124; Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit has seen a sharp drop recently as the cryptocurrency price has gone through a significant drawdown. The indicator&#8217;s value has dropped to around the 90% mark, which means that about 10% of the supply is currently carrying a loss. The chart shows that the last time the metric touched these levels was back on 22 March. Interestingly, the asset also found its bottom around then. Earlier, the Percent Supply In Profit had pushed towards the 100% mark, which was a natural consequence of the price setting a new all-time high (ATH), since at fresh highs, all of the supply must be out of the red. Generally, the investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins, so if many come into gains, the possibility of a mass selloff rises. Due to this reason, high levels of the Percent Supply In Profit have often led to tops. Related Reading: Start Selling Bitcoin When This Happens, This Quant Says Similarly, bottoms become more likely when investor profitability levels drop relatively low. The current value of 90% is still quite high, but this isn&#8217;t unusual during bull runs, as there is strong demand and ATHs are being explored. The fact that the profitability has cooled off compared to earlier levels may be constructive for the rally&#8217;s chances to see a continuation, just like it did last month. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been trading at around the $65,700 level, down more than 5% over the past week. &#160; The price of the asset seems to have been tumbling down over the past couple of days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Shutterstock.com, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-plummets-as-us-government-transfers-2b-in-seized-silk-road-btc-coincidence/",
    "description": "The crypto market is abuzz with speculation as the US government recently moved significantly regarding seized Bitcoin (BTC) linked to the infamous Silk Road dark web marketplace. This development comes at a critical time for the Bitcoin price, which has struggled to maintain its position above the $70,000 threshold after hitting its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14.  As the largest cryptocurrency experiences yet another round of price correction, the movement of these seized funds has triggered intense speculation about a potential sell-off by the US government. Seized Silk Road BTC On The Move According to on-chain data, a wallet linked to the US government recently transferred 30,175 Bitcoin, seized from the Silk Road dark web marketplace.  Related Reading: Ethereum And Altcoins Crash: Why Is This Analyst Super Bullish? This transfer follows the earlier seizure of over 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who illegally obtained the cryptocurrency from the Silk Road in 2012. The US Department of Justice&#8217;s (DOJ) seizure of these funds marked the largest cryptocurrency seizure in its history. This is not the first instance of the US government moving Bitcoin obtained from criminal cases. In March 2022, the government sold 9,800 Bitcoin, with plans to sell an additional 41,500 BTC. However, the recent transfer of the 30,175 BTC from Silk Road-related addresses has raised questions about the fate of these funds and their potential impact on the Bitcoin price correction.  Benjamin Skew, an on-chain data expert, took to social media to offer insights into the situation. Skew clarified that although there is chaos surrounding the Silk Road Bitcoin being sent to Coinbase for sale, a closer examination reveals that the main funds were transferred to a newly created wallet that remains inactive.  However, Skew stated that 2,000 BTC of the total amount was transferred to the alleged Coinbase wallet for undisclosed purposes, while the rest was sent to a newly created wallet.  200EMA Support Crucial For The Bitcoin Price The Bitcoin price is currently witnessing a lack of bullish momentum as the cryptocurrency continues to face resistance in consolidating above the crucial $70,000 threshold. However, there is still hope on the horizon.  Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights the importance of the 200-epimetric moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart of BTC. According to Martinez, this indicator has acted as formidable support since early February and continues to play a crucial role in preventing further downward movement.  Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? The focus on the 200EMA stems from its potential to either catalyze a rebound or trigger more losses for Bitcoin. Martinez stated that if the 200EMA continues to hold as strong support, it signifies a significant probability of a price rebound. This scenario would provide renewed bullish momentum and potentially propel Bitcoin&#8217;s price above the $70,000 mark.  However, if the 200EMA is broken, as it was in mid-January, as seen in the chart below, the analyst suggests that this could expose the Bitcoin price to further downward pressure and potentially lead to further losses. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $65,390, continuing its recent price correction. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has experienced a 5% decline; over the past seven days, it has seen a significant drop of over 6%.  The market closely monitors whether the current key support level can sustain further price drops or if a potential bounce will occur before reaching that point. The outcome of these scenarios remains uncertain.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whales-making-moves/",
    "description": "The price of Solana had briefly crossed $200 before tumbling back down in the last week. This move has triggered a wave of movement across the market, and whales are now showing their hands. Over the last day, there have been a number of notable whale transactions and their destinations could give an inkling as to how these large crypto investors are looking at the market right now. Solana Whales Move Hundreds Of Millions Worth Of SOL The whale movements began on Monday when the market had first begun to slow down, with the Solana price falling below $190. The on-chain data tracking platform Whale Alert, reported these transactions, a number of which seemed to happened right next to one another. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Inches Closer With Less Than 2,900 Blocks Left The first transaction was one carrying 993,453 SOL which was worth $189.55 million at the time. Then minutes later, the tracker reported the movement of another 1,895,729 SOL worth $361.7 million. Not too long after, it reported a third transaction carrying 1,096,940 SOL worth $209.29 million. Then, the last transaction in this row of transactions was 1 million SOL, valued at $190 million at the time of the transaction. Now, all of these Solana transactions had originated from unknown wallets and their destination were also unknown wallets. This means that the owners of these wallets are not publicly known and their addressed have not been tagged. In such cases, it could suggest that these whales are selling their tokens over the counter in order to minimize the impact of their selling on the market market. However, it could also be that these whales are just redistributing their coins. Nevertheless, the whale movements didn’t end here as a couple of hours later, the on-chain tracker would report the movement of massive amounts of SOL once more. This time around, a whale moved 149,999 SOL worth a little over $27.79 million from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. This transaction deviates from the previous four transactions in the fact that its destination is a crypto exchange. Usually, when investors move their coins to exchanges such as Binance, it is to sell their tokens and a $27.79 million sale could put a lot of pressure on the SOL price. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin, Altcoins Are The Winners Of This Cycle, Crypto Analyst Says The next whale transaction reported after this was an amore positive one though which involved the movement of 146,121 SOL worth $26.83 million from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. In this case, it is likely that the whale is withdrawing their coins for safekeeping as they wait for better prices. This reduces the selling pressure on the asset. Even with these whale movements, the SOL price continues to hold up quite nicely. If the selling pressure continues to fall and the pressure from Bitcoin’s price decline is finally lifted, then SOL price could quickly rally above $200 once again.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/makerdao-initiates-massive-600-million-dai-investment-in-usde-and-susde/",
    "description": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol MakerDAO is considering allocating 600 million DAI stablecoins to the USDe and staked USDe (sUSDe) protocols through the DeFi lending platform Morpho Labs. The proposed allocation aims to improve risk management and maximize user incentives in the DeFi landscape. MakerDAO Sets Maximum 600 Million DAI Allocation The Spark DAI Vault, launched in 2023 as a lending platform, experienced strong demand soon after its launch, according to MakerDAO&#8217;s announcement on the protocol&#8217;s governance forum.  Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? Given the desire to keep liquidity risk at an acceptable level, MakerDAO proposes a greater allocation of DAI to the USDe pools, which can be immediately redeemed via Ethena (ENA), a synthetic dollar protocol developed on the Ethereum blockchain.  This reallocation also allows Ethena to retain a larger revenue share for their insurance fund, potentially improving the overall risk profile of MakerDAO&#8217;s Ethena allocation. Furthermore, MakerDAO recommends focusing future allocations on the 86% and 91.5% Loan-To-Liquidity-Value (LLTV) pools, which have shown “higher efficiency” regarding borrow rates and user demand. While lower LLTV pools, such as the 77% and 94.5% pools, will continue to receive allocations, they will be proportionally lower than the two primary pools. To mitigate potential insolvency risks and ensure a favorable risk-reward ratio, MakerDAO limits the total allocation to 600 million DAI. However, the Dividend Debt Mechanism (DDM) line parameter is set at 1 billion DAI to provide flexibility for future increases if constraints change. In addition, MakerDAO recommends marginally increasing the funds deployed in the 77% and 94.5% pools to 10 million DAI each to ensure sufficient pool size for “efficient management of positions” and the calibration of interest rate models. The recently unveiled Ethena points program for Season 2 introduces a $500 million cap on total eligible collateral for incentives on Morpho. If demand for DAI borrowing through the vault declines after this threshold is reached, the protocol states that Multisig can reduce allocations below $600 million to maintain a balanced supply/demand dynamic and align with expected collateral returns. MKR Surges To Near Three-Year High MakerDAO&#8217;s native token, MKR, hit a nearly three-year high of $4,074 on Sunday, which is 40% below its current all-time high (ATH) of $6,292 in May 2023. The token has pulled back nearly 2% and is currently trading at $3,717. It is consolidating above its next support level of $3,640.
