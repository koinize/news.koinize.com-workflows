    "description": "The price of Avalanche&#8217;s AVAX token has dipped by 11% in the past week, bucking the bullish trend in the broader cryptocurrency market. This comes amidst a $365 million unlocking event that increased the token&#8217;s circulating supply by 2.6%. Experts suggest both short-term challenges and long-term opportunities for AVAX. Unlocking Event Triggers AVAX Price Dip Source: Token.Unlocks Token.Unlocks data indicates that on Thursday, locked-up tokens valued at approximately $303 million will be released from vesting and put into circulation. On February 15th, a significant unlocking event saw 9.5 million AVAX tokens, worth roughly $365 million, released from a vesting period. This influx of previously locked-up tokens coincided with a price decline for AVAX, which fell from $40.32 to its current price or nearly $37. This aligns with historical trends, as a 2023 report by The Tie found that large unlocking events often lead to price drops within two weeks due to supply outpacing demand. AVAX price in the red. Source: Coingecko Analyst Opinions Diverge Despite the recent dip, some analysts remain optimistic about AVAX&#8217;s future. The Tie&#8217;s report, while acknowledging the short-term price pressure, highlights the Avalanche network&#8217;s growing activity, fueled by popular NFT collections like Dreamheadz and Dokyoworld. The increased engagement within the NFT space is seen as a positive indicator for long-term adoption and potential price appreciation.

This suggests some resilience in the face of the unlocking event and potential buying pressure despite the overall price dip. Some analysts even predict a possible climb to the $40 mark by the end of February, although this remains speculative. Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at $36.95. Chart: TradingView.com Market Sentiment And Broader Trends It&#8217;s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and AVAX&#8217;s price will be influenced by various factors beyond the unlocking event. The overall market sentiment, regulatory changes, and broader economic trends can all play a significant role. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. AVAX price retreating today. Source: Coingecko The recent unlocking event has undoubtedly impacted AVAX&#8217;s price in the short term. However, analysts remain divided on the token&#8217;s future trajectory. While some anticipate further price declines due to the increased supply, others highlight positive developments like the network&#8217;s growing NFT activity and potential for a rebound.
