It just happened that the project that I commenced before I knew anything about NFTs, doing audiovisual work with code, happened to align with things that were happening within Ethereum, 0xDEAFBEEF says. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It was great timing. When I look back, had I missed that window in 2021 by three to six months, things might have looked much different. </p></blockquote><p>But like so many successful NFT artists that have emerged in the explosion of the new digital art era, not planned is a common theme. </p><p>In March 2021, his <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd754937672300ae6708a51229112de4017810934/100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Synth Poems</a> were born, inspired by the sound of analog synthesizers.

Its a theme of crypto in general with things being permanent and immutable, says 0xDEAFBEEF. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It was interesting to me. Theres a narrative of on-chain art being more permanent than other NFTs where the files are stored on another server and have the potential to disappear. But I asked myself the question of how immutable it is through Entropy. </p></blockquote><p>Using the Entropy artwork to paradoxically critique the idea of permanence by having this digital artwork that changes and degrades every time it changes ownership  I thought it was interesting thematically. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Entropy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fP0k6JZh4w?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://cointelegraph.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p>Since the recent introduction of the <a href=\"https://blur.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Blur marketplace</a>, many NFT collections, particularly PFP projects, have seen the emphasis on aesthetics decline with most sales being anchored to current floor prices. Its also posed the question of does the number of times an NFT gets passed around between owners matter? </p><p>For some collectors, it actually does. While a digital piece of art or collectible doesnt face the same wear and tear challenges a physical item does, the history of ownership could be a factor, with some collectors putting a premium on those that havent been passed around like a hot potato. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sell-or-hodl-how-to-prepare-for-the-end-of-the-bull-run-part-2/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Sell or hodl?

People can have their own interpretation, but I dont think it was necessarily a means to really discourage people from trading the NFT or transferring the NFT, he says. </p><p>Is it more valuable if its been transferred or not? Its up to the collectors to decide, but it does add this narrative. It wasnt really a way to stick it to people that are buying and selling works  thats obviously part of the culture. Tradability and collectibility is a very interesting dimension of NFTs. Its really just an artwork that touches on all of those themes and at least asks you to consider it. </p><h2 id=\"h-personal-style\"><strong>Personal style: </strong></h2><p>Many NFT collectors believe its harder for digital artists that focus on audio to cut through as effectively as visual artists as audio takes longer to consume. </p><p>0xDEAFBEEF has been able to cut through this friction with his own distinct monochrome visual style that is a great hook to unlock the audio aspect of the art. </p><p>People see it first before they hear it usually because of the dominance of social media  its all visually oriented. The monochrome aesthetic of my work is something that comes through a lot. Theres a bunch of reasons why I work in monochrome. One of them is just being practical because this was originally a sound-based project, he says. </p><p>I was focused on audio synthesis, and I was focused on motion and animation. Bringing those two things together is already many dimensions, so working with sound and with motion that might introduce color is too much. Monochrome has sort of become part of the style for those reasons. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Advection 222\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8rDtdoQ-9c?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://cointelegraph.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=\"h-notable-sales-to-date\"><strong>Notable sales to date:</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://opensea.io/bundles/ethereum/full-deafbeef-set-serioes-0-5-BAc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >DEAFBEEF Full Set</a> (6 items)  Sold for 2,275 ETH ($6.8 million on the date of sale) on Aug. 19, 2021. </p><p>(The buyer was later revealed as Brevan Howard founder Alan Howard.)</p><figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"512\" height=\"509\" data-id=\"20302\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/glitchgox1.jpg\" alt=\"Glitchbox\" class=\"wp-image-20302\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/glitchgox1.jpg 512w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/glitchgox1-300x298.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/glitchgox1-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><mark style=\"color:#fafafa\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><em>Glitchbox from the set of 6.

Cuba Bitcoin is a lively group of Bitcoin advocates and activists whose discussions on Telegram between anonymous social media accounts that hide people’s identities, had yet to make it into the real world.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/c5994b11-5e53-4cf8-86e3-e8a04a2d20b2.jpeg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Cuba Bitcoin community complete with emojis to hide faces.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cuba’s foray into Bitcoin signifies a departure from the centralized economic model that has shaped Cuba’s economic progress for decades. Despite limited internet access, financial constraints, and a socialist-styled government, the meetup underscored that Cubans are increasingly turning to crypto as a means of financial freedom and an “exit” from the local economy.</p><p>Co-founder of Cuba Bitcoin, Forte11 (not his real name) told Cointelegraph:</p><blockquote>“The mission of the meetup is to educate–not convince Cubans about the potential of Bitcoin in Cuba. Each person has the freedom of expression to decide what they want to do. It’s education, education, and education first and foremost.”</blockquote><p>While Bitcoin meet-ups in the Western World might be dominated by white, middle-aged men, Cuba’s Bitcoin-only meet-up included a wide range of characters. From small business owners to software developers to teenage students to grandmothers, more than 60 people turned up. Paco de la India, a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-runs-the-world-traveling-to-40-countries-in-400-days-with-btc\">Bitcoin vlogger and evangelist</a> also attended, delivering a talk on Bitcoin adoption around the world.</p><p>Although Cuba is technically a centrally-planned economy, the state recently relaxed laws on private business <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58132000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ownership</a>. This arena is the target market for Bitcoin merchant adoption, as coupled with the recent crypto regulations passed in Cuba, it is now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-approves-cryptocurrency-services-requires-central-bank-license-2022-04-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">legal</a> to accept cryptocurrencies for goods and services. </p><p>To demonstrate this, the group sold Cuba Bitcoin t-shirts for 1,000 Satoshis ($0.30) so attendees would learn about the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work\">layer-2 lightning network.</a> The T-shirts sold out.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/831344a5-8ec8-42d0-a18c-c7739a952e91.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Paying for T-shirts with Bitcoin Lightning during the meetup.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nonetheless, the main talk of the day revolves around how to get one's hands on Bitcoin. In a country where mobile Internet penetration remains relatively low and smartphones are not yet ubiquitous, downloading Bitcoin applications or wallets is out of reach for many Cubans. </p><p>What’s more, due to the US trade embargo, familiar exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are not welcome in Cuba. As a result, to buy Bitcoin, Cubans tend to do so the OG way, through peer-to-peer exchange. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/a5103e97-9296-40b3-8be5-2dee3e5ae5e7.JPG\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Forte11 introduces \"C\" (face hidden) ahead of their talk on buying Bitcoin peer-to-peer.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bitcoin Cuba co-founder “C” delivered a talk on how to buy bitcoin, peer-to-peer through telegram trading groups. Through a lightning-enabled tipping bot chat on Telegram, Cubans can buy bitcoin in exchange for Cuban pesos, or the Cuban MLC, which is a “dollar-backed” government-owned stablecoin. Mobile transfers can also make purchases as more and more Cubans access, government-run banking services. Most trades in the telegram groups range between $.20 to $50; the average Cuban owns just $40 a month.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-bitcoin-maxi-economic-advisor\"><strong><em> ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ author becomes economic adviser to El Salvador</em></strong></a></p><p>A well-known Cuban crypto enthusiast, Erich Garcia Cruz also attended the meetup. He told Cointelegraph: </p><blockquote>“Using Bitcoin you can be a freedom person. We have a lot of opportunity here if we teach to all the businesses to use Bitcoin as a payment method; to use Bitcoin as a freedom tool–as that’s the path.”</blockquote><p>Now more than 10 businesses in Cuba’s capital, Havana, accept Bitcoin for goods and services. Buoyed by the success of the first Cuba Bitcoin meetup, the community intends to set up regular future meetups and events. </p><p><em>This interview is part of an upcoming Youtube documentary about Bitcoin adoption in Cuba.

    "description": "Optimism (OP) has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies over the last week as bearish sentiment around the coin rose rapidly. The reason for this was a massive amount of OP tokens that were unlocked this week, leading to significant buy pressure on the digital asset. However, the bearish trend does not seem to have ended yet given that the altcoin could see more buying pressure. $600 Million Token Unlock Sends Optimism Spiralling On Tuesday, Optimism saw one of its largest token unlocks when over 300 million were released into circulation. These tokens accounted for around 9% of the total OP supply, which was a significant amount to move into the market, especially during a bear market. Related Reading: Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close The coins totaling 386 million OP at the time were worth approximately $600 million. This meant that there was now $600 million worth of new potential selling pressure for the token and the altcoin began to respond before the unlock was live. In the hours leading up to the massive unlock, OP’s price first dropped around 7%. But then the unlock triggered further sell pressure and by the time the sellers were done for the day, the digital asset had already lost more than 20% of the value it began the day with. OP falls to five-month low &#124; Source: OPUSD on TradingView.com More Pain To Come For OP Holders? While it does seem that OP sellers are starting to tire out, the bearish case for the altcoin continues. This is because the $600 million unlock was only the first unlock for core contributors and investors, meaning VCs and others. Data from Token Unlocks shows that Optimism has another token unlock coming up at the end of June for a total of 24.15 million tokens. This means that a month from now, another $34.5 million worth of tokens will be unlocked. This 0.562% of supply may be smaller than the 9% unlock that took place in May but it will put selling pressure on the token nonetheless. $34.5 million in OP set to be unlocked on June 30 &#124; Source: Token Unlocks At the time of writing, the coin is down 10% on the daily chart and 33% on the monthly chart. OP’s price has now fallen to $1.37, a price level that has not been seen since January. This is a 50% decline from its 2023 highs. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run If the bulls fail to recover OP’s price this week, then it could fall below the $1.3 support. A fall below this level would be detrimental to holders as the next likely support for the digital asset would sit at $1.2, prompting a further 10% drop.
