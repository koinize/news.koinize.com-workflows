    "description": "Crypto investment products have experienced another week of inflows, bringing the run to 10 consecutive weeks. According to CoinShares&#8217; latest report on digital asset investment funds, inflows into crypto products totaled $176 million last week, bringing the total inflow in 10 weeks to $1.76 billion. The timing is not a coincidence, as most cryptocurrencies turned green again last week in terms of price action. Total Crypto Inflows Hit $1.76 Billion In 10 Weeks After a lackluster action for most of the year and some weeks of net outflows, the most recent data shows smart money investors are betting big on crypto again. Investments in digital asset funds have been on the rise for the past two months, ignited by the crypto market bull run which started in the middle of October. As a result, the inflows have ballooned every week, breaking levels not seen since 2021&#8217;s crypto market bull run.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rallies To 4-Month Highs – Can Bulls Take It Above $0.3? Digital asset investment funds ended November with an inflow of $176 million, although down from the $346 million registered in the week before. Most of the money last week went into Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency seeing $133 million in inflows.  Bitcoin remains the most popular digital asset for institutions, and interest has really piqued with the applications of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US waiting for approval from regulators. As a result, the crypto has strengthened since October, breaking various price levels and resistances, the latest being the $42,000 price level. The sentiment has also flowed into the altcoin market. Ethereum saw inflows of $31 million last week, bringing its 5-week inflow run to a total of $134 million. Multi-asset investment products that provide exposure to a basket of crypto assets saw $2.3 million in new investment.  Total market cap at $1.5 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Solana and XRP saw inflows of $4.3 million and $0.5 million respectively. On the other hand, Litecoin saw outflows of $0.2 million, and Short Bitcoin products saw $3.6 million inflows after three consecutive weeks of outflows.  Most of the inflows came in from Canada, Germany, and the US, which saw inflows of $79 million, $57 million, and $54 million respectively. Australia and Sweden also saw outflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million respectively. However, the overall trend shows institutions are still bullish on crypto in the long run. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Explode: Analyst Identifies Trigger For Next Parabolic Move It&#8217;s exciting to see such numbers again, as they are reminiscent of past bullish sentiment in the crypto industry. According to CoinShares, this run of inflows is now the largest since October 2021, which saw the launch of the futures-based ETF in the US.  Assets under management have also risen by 107% this year and are now at $46.2 billion, but still below the $86.6 billion seen in 2021. However, this record is ready to be overtaken in the coming year, as the latest data provides further evidence that institutional interest in the crypto market will continue for a while.
