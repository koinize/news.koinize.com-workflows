The survey interviewed 2360 Canadians, selected to reflect the accurate proportion of the country’s population by gender, age and region.</p><p>Perhaps due to the period when the research was done, its results reflect a general pessimism toward crypto in the country’s population. While the number of Canadians able to give a basic definition of crypto rose from 51% in 2022 to 54% in 2023, only 34% of them now believe that crypto “will play a key role in the future,” compared to 49% in 2022.</p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-canadian-dollar-fails-impress-residents-despite-high-awareness\"><strong><em>Digital Canadian dollar fails to impress despite high awareness</em></strong></a></p><p>Fewer Canadians own crypto assets than a year ago — 10% in 2023 versus 13% in 2022. These are most likely to be males aged 25-44 with a higher education diploma and a full-time job. </p><p>Despite the pessimism, 39% of respondents claimed their crypto portfolio to be profitable compared to an initial investment, which is only slightly less than in 2022 (46%). And the average value of such a portfolio rose dramatically from $52,975 last year to $82,998 this year. </p><p>The most common reason for buying crypto remains stable — as in 2022 and 2023, it was a “speculative investment.” According to the survey, the number of those who bought crypto as a “long-term investment” dropped from 29% last year to 20% this year. </p><p>The numbers in the Canadian survey <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-econd-most-popular-investment-asset-france-report\">match the recent results</a> of the analogous research in France.
