The co-founders took to X (formerly Twitter) on Nov. 26 to <a href=\"https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1728850795318112353?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announce</a> that they also plan to burn all of their BanklessDAO (BANK) tokens on the back of this proposal.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hello CT<br><br>To lead with the obvious, we could be better in accepting criticism of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BanklessHQ</a>. <br><br>I hold Bankless very dear, and I&#39;ve got an innate reflex to protect it when I see it being unfairly attacked. <br><br>This clouds my ability to hear what CT is trying to tell me,… <a href=\"https://t.co/7L5ufQ1bAu\">pic.twitter.com/7L5ufQ1bAu</a></p>&mdash; DavidHoffman.eth (@TrustlessState) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1728849871682048136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Hoffman and Adams’ decision to separate Bankless from BanklessDAO came in response to community criticism of BanklessDAO’s application for a grant from Arbitrum. <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-banklessdaos-global-education-and-onboarding-campaign-for-arbitrum/19653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Filed</a> on Nov. 20, the application asked for 1.82 million Arbitrum (ARB) tokens from Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling project for the Ethereum blockchain. The amount is worth around $1.8 million at the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to data from CoinGecko.</p><p>“The concern is that BanklessDAO would not be able to make such ambitious proposals without leveraging the weight of the Bankless brand, which they did not produce, is not theirs, and ought not to benefit from,” Hoffman wrote.</p><p>The BanklessDAO community was quick to criticize the initiative, with many DAO members pointing out that the proposal requested almost two million ARB for writing content without providing detailed information about how the money would be spent. In response, BanklessDAO <a href=\"https://x.com/banklessDAO/status/1728380586933510638?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">committed</a> to revising the proposal to cut the one-year grant to three months and providing clear KPIs and milestones.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/d6a0e8e3-59aa-4c8c-8fd4-025b4c6d5197.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BanklessDAO’s education and onboarding campaign for Arbitrum.
