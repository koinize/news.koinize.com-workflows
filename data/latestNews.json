But “almost nothing” is still something. And we can glean a lot from what little we do know.</p><p>As Cointelegraph recently reported, Musk <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-kickstarts-new-ai-company-to-understand-the-universe\">announced xAI on July 12</a> in a <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">statement</a> comprising three sentences,<strong> </strong>“Today we announce the formation of xAI. The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe. You can meet the team and ask us questions during a Twitter Spaces chat on Friday, July 14th.”</p><p>Based on this information we can deduce that xAI exists, it is doomed, and more information about how it will fail will be revealed on Twitter. The reason it is doomed is simple: The laws of physics prevent it.</p><p>According to a report from Reuters, Musk’s motivation for xAI is based on a desire to develop safe artificial intelligence (AI). In a recent Twitter Spaces event, he said:</p><blockquote>“If it tried to understand the true nature of the universe, that’s actually the best thing that I can come up with from an AI safety standpoint.”</blockquote><p>This is a laudable goal, but any attempts to understand the “true” nature of the universe are doomed because there isn’t a ground-truth knowledge center somewhere where we can verify our theories against. </p><p>It’s not that humans aren’t smart enough to understand the nature of the universe — the problem is that the universe is really, really big, and we’re stuck inside of it. </p><p>Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tells</a> us unequivocally that certain aspects of reality cannot be confirmed simultaneously through observation or measurement. This is the reason why we can’t just measure the distance between Earth and Uranus, wait a year, measure it again, and determine the exact <a href=\"https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/03/08/how-fast-is-the-universe-expanding-galaxies-provide-one-answer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">rate</a> of the universe’s expansion.</p><p>The scientific method requires observation, and, as the anthropic principle <a href=\"https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0135.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">teaches</a> us, all observers are limited.</p><p>In the case of the observable universe, we’re further limited by the nature of physics. The universe is expanding at such a rapid pace that it <a href=\"https://futurism.com/what-lies-beyond-the-edge-of-the-observable-universe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">prohibits</a> us from measuring anything beyond a certain point, no matter what tools we use. </p><p>The universe’s expansion doesn’t just make it bigger. It gives it a distinct, definable “cosmological horizon” that the laws of physics prevent us from measuring beyond. If we were to send a probe out at the maximum allowable speed under the laws of physics, the speed of light, then every bit of the universe that’s beyond the exact point the probe could travel in X amount of time is forever inaccessible. </p><p>This means even a hypothetical superintelligence capable of processing all of the data that’s ever been generated still could not determine any ground truths about the universe. </p><p>A slight twist on Schrödinger’s Cat thought experiment, called Wigner’s Friend, demonstrates why this is the case. In the original, Erwin Schrödinger imagined a cat trapped in a box with a vial of radioactive liquid and a hammer that would strike the vial, and thus kill the cat, upon the completion of a quantum process. </p><p>One of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical processes is that quantum processes can be affected by observation. In quantum mechanics, this means that the hypothetical cat is both alive and dead until someone observes it. </p><p>Physicist Eugene Wigner was <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-twist-on-schroedingers-cat-paradox-has-major-implications-for-quantum-theory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> “irked” by this and decided to throw his own spin on the thought experiment to challenge Schrödinger’s assertions. His version added two scientists, one inside the lab who opens the box to observe whether the cat was alive or dead and another outside who opens the door to the lab to see whether the scientist inside knows whether the cat is alive or dead. </p><p>What xAI appears to be proposing is a reversal of Wigner’s thought experiment. They seemingly want to remove the cat from the box and replace it with a general pre-trained transformer (GPT) AI system — i.e., a chatbot like ChatGPT, Bard or Claude 2. </p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-to-launch-truth-seeking-artificial-intelligence-platform-truthgpt\">Elon Musk to launch truth-seeking artificial intelligence platform TruthGPT</a></strong></em></p><p>Instead of asking an observer to determine whether the AI is alive or dead, their plan is to ask the AI to discern ground truths about the lab outside of the box, the world outside of the lab and the universe beyond the cosmological horizon without making any observations. </p><p>The reality of what xAI seems to be proposing would mean the development of an oracle: a machine capable of knowing things it doesn’t have evidence for. </p><p>There is no scientific basis for the idea of an oracle; its origins are rooted in mythology and religion. Scientifically speaking, the best we can hope for is that xAI develops a machine capable of parsing all of the data that’s ever been <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/science/how-much-information-is-in-the-universe#:~:text=From%20this%2C%20Vopson%20calculated%20that%20the%20overall%20amount,worldwide%20during%20the%20year%202020%20%E2%80%93%2064.2%20zettabytes.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">generated</a>. </p><p>There’s no conceivable reason to believe this would turn the machine into an oracle, but maybe it’ll allow it to help scientists see something they missed and lead to further insight. Perhaps the secret to cold fusion is lying around in a Reddit data set somewhere that nobody’s managed to use to train a GPT model yet. </p><p>But, unless the AI system can defy the laws of physics, any answers it gives us regarding the “true” nature of the universe will have to be taken on faith until confirmed by observations made from beyond the box — and the cosmological horizon. </p><p>For these reasons, and many others related to how GPT systems actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-stupidity-of-ai-artificial-intelligence-dall-e-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">interpret</a> queries, there’s no scientifically viable method by which xAI, or any other AI company, can develop a binary machine running classical algorithms capable of observing the truth about our quantum universe. </p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Tristan Greene</strong> is a deputy news editor for Cointelegraph.

Individual investors or institutional lenders, on the other hand, can analyze these listings and decide to fund them based on their level of risk tolerance and expected rate of return.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/49a6caa9-3b5a-41cf-8585-7d6fa77e3123.jpg\"  /></figure><p>P2P lending platforms serve as intermediaries, enabling the loan application, credit evaluation and loan servicing processes. They <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-crypto-lending-and-how-does-it-work\">leverage technology</a> to improve the user experience and pair lenders and borrowers. The loans may be used for a variety of things, including debt consolidation, small company loans, school loans and personal loans.</p><p>P2P lending platforms function within the legal restrictions imposed by the country in which they are based. Platforms must abide by all applicable laws, particularly those relating to borrower and investor protection, which differ depending on the country’s regulations.</p><h3>Examples of P2P lending platforms</h3><p>LendingClub is one of the largest P2P lending platforms in the United States. It offers personal loans, business loans and auto refinancing options. Zopa is another prominent P2P lending platform in the United Kingdom. It offers personal loans and investments, connecting borrowers and investors directly.</p><p>Aave is a decentralized P2P lending platform on the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-ethereum-a-beginners-guide-to-eth-cryptocurrency#:~:text=Ethereum%20is%20a%20decentralized%20blockchain,media%20and%20so%20much%20more.\">Ethereum blockchain</a> that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies at interest rates that are based on supply and demand dynamics. It provides a wide range of features, including incentives for liquidity mining, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-flash-loans-in-defi\">flash loans</a> and collateralized borrowing.</p><h2>How does P2P lending work?</h2><p>Let’s understand the P2P lending process using an example. Say Bob wants to borrow $10,000 to consolidate his debt. On a P2P lending platform, he submits a loan application and includes his financial details and loan justification. After evaluating John’s creditworthiness, the platform lists his loan. </p><p>A platform user named Alice reads John’s loan listing and decides to fund $1,000 of the loan because she thinks it fits with her investment philosophy. As additional lenders follow suit, Bob receives the $10,000 when the loan has been fully funded. The P2P lending network disperses Bob’s monthly repayments, which include principal and interest, among the lenders over time. Bob pays interest, which gives Alice and other lenders a return on their investment.</p><p>The step-by-step process of P2P pending between Bob and Alice is explained below:</p><ul><li>Bob submits an application for a $10,000 loan for debt consolidation on a P2P lending website.</li><li>Based on Bob’s financial information and loan purpose, the P2P lending platform evaluates his creditworthiness.</li><li>The platform lists Bob’s loan request along with information about the amount, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/apr-vs-apy-whats-the-difference#:~:text=In%20crypto%2C%20the%20APY%20is,the%20APY%20includes%20compound%20interest.\">annual percentage rate</a> and purpose of the loan.</li><li>Following an examination of the various loan listings, Alice, a platform investor, chooses to contribute $1,000 to Bob’s loan.</li><li>Bob receives the $10,000 loan amount after additional lenders have fully funded the loan.</li><li>Bob pays the P2P lending platform a certain amount each month in principal and interest.</li><li>The P2P lending network collects Bob’s repayments and then distributes them to other lenders, such as Alice.</li><li>Through the interest payments made by Bob over time, Alice and the other lenders make money on their investments.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges\"><strong><em>What is P2P trading, and how does it work on peer-to-peer crypto exchanges?</em></strong></a></p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/bbccf3e9-8de9-45fb-8757-c7034b71918d.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Secured vs. unsecured P2P lending</h2><p>Secured and unsecured P2P lending are two distinct approaches to lending in the context of peer-to-peer platforms. Secured P2P lending refers to loans backed by assets, such as traditional ones like real estate or cars, as well as digital ones like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide-to-digital-money\">cryptocurrency</a>, as collateral. When a borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the collateral to recover their funds.</p><p>On the other hand, unsecured P2P lending does not require collateral. Lenders base their risk evaluation on the borrower’s creditworthiness and financial background. In cases of default, lenders often turn to legal procedures for debt recovery as they have no specific assets to seize in the event of a default. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b54ed5bc-35e4-40a9-8ce6-e7d919a8c9a2.jpg\"  /></figure><p>The P2P platform’s collateral policies, interest rates and risks must be carefully considered by both borrowers and lenders when considering offering an unsecured loan. </p><h2>How to become a peer-to-peer lender</h2><p>Find a P2P lending platform that fits your investment preferences before applying to become a peer-to-peer lender. Choose platforms with a solid reputation, clear pricing arrangements and a history of effective loan transactions. Additionally, users should become familiar with the P2P lending regulations in their country since there may be certain requirements or licensing procedures to follow.</p><p>Create an account by entering the required information, such as identification verification and banking information, after selecting a platform. Next, deposit the money users want to use to invest in P2P lending into their accounts. This sum will act as their capital for lending.</p><p>Users will have access to loan listings on the site as P2P lenders. These listings provide information on the borrowers, the goals of the loans, the interest rates and the risk levels. Based on their investment criteria and risk tolerance, users should evaluate each listing. </p><p>After deciding which loans to sponsor, users should keep a tight eye on their holdings. They should keep track of the due dates, interest accruals and any late payments or defaults. Some platforms offer automated reinvestment options that allow users to put repayments toward new loans to raise their potential profits.</p><p>However, as there are risks involved with peer-to-peer lending, such as the potential for borrower defaults, investors should carefully <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-lending-and-borrowing-explained\">analyze borrower profiles</a> and loan details before making lending decisions. </p><h2>Can you make passive income by investing in P2P lending?</h2><p>P2P lending can provide passive income to lenders, as discussed below:</p><h3>Regular interest income</h3><p>P2P lenders can earn recurring interest on their loans. Borrowers’ interest payments generate money during the loan period. This income can be a source of passive cash flow, especially if investors have a diversified portfolio of loans.</p><p>However, the amount of interest earned depends on the loan amount, the interest rate and the borrower’s repayment behavior.</p><h3>Passive portfolio management</h3><p>P2P lending systems manage loan servicing, payment collection and lender distribution once lenders select and fund loans. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-asset-segregation-how-crypto-asset-management-works\">Passive portfolio management</a> lets them earn without actively managing loans.</p><p>The platform makes sure that lenders receive their fair share of interest payments and that borrower repayments are completed.</p><h3>Automated investment</h3><p>P2P lending platforms offer automated features and tools to simplify investing. Auto-invest options automatically distribute funds to new loans based on lenders’ predefined criteria, eliminating manual selection and investment decisions.</p><h3>Reinvest repayments</h3><p>As borrowers repay their loans, lenders can expand their total loan portfolio and raise interest income by continuously reinvesting the repayments. Reinvestment allows lenders to compound their earnings and potentially grow their passive income over time.</p><h2>Risks and rewards of investing in P2P lending</h2><p>Investing in P2P lending comes with both risks and rewards, as explained in the sections below:</p><h3>Risks associated with P2P lending</h3><ul><li>Default risk: P2P lending is risky due to borrower defaults. Borrowers may default, losing principle and interest income.</li><li>Credit risk: P2P lenders lend to individuals and small businesses of varying creditworthiness. Therefore, borrowers with high-risk exposure may default.</li><li>Lack of collateral: Lenders may have few assets to recover in the event of a default, raising risk.</li><li>Platform risk: Lenders may face trouble getting their money back if a P2P platform encounters operational problems, financial instability or fails altogether. </li><li>Market and economic risk: Financial instability and economic downturns can increase default rates and decrease the value of loans in the secondary market.</li></ul><h3>Rewards offered by P2P lending</h3><ul><li>Higher returns: P2P lending can outperform fixed-income investments. Investors can outperform <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-earn-interest-from-crypto-saving-accounts\">savings accounts</a> and other low-yield assets by lending directly to borrowers.</li><li>Diversification: P2P lending lets investors diversify across multiple loans, reducing portfolio risk and loan defaults.</li><li>Passive income: Monthly or quarterly interest payments make P2P lending a passive revenue source. Investors can benefit without actively managing their holdings.</li><li>Access to credit market: P2P lending networks offer financing to borrowers who may not qualify for bank loans, which helps promote financial inclusion and may yield high rewards for lenders.</li><li>Transparency and control: Investors can check borrower profiles, loan information and hazards on P2P lending platforms and choose loans that match their risk tolerance and investment criteria.</li></ul><p>Therefore, before engaging in P2P lending, it’s critical for both lenders and borrowers to carefully consider and comprehend the risks involved. Some of the tactics that can help reduce these risks include diversification, caution and choosing reliable platforms.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-earn-passive-income-with-peer-to-peer-lending&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
