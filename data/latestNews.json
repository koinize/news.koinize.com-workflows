According to court documents, Judge Torres granted summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, ruling that the XRP token is not a security, but only in regard to programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges. XRP’s price skyrocketed within minutes of the news breaking. The case has been ongoing since December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple and two of its executives over allegations of offering an unregistered security. Despite the positive outcome, several lawyers <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-holders-celebrate-ripple-win-victory-sec-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >warned against celebrating too soon</a>, noting the ruling is only partial and does not set a precedent.
