The air-cooling miner supports the SHA256 mining algorithm used for mining <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained\">proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies</a> like Bitcoin, as well as forked coins like Bitcoin Cash (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index\">BCH</a>) and Bitcoin SV (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bsv-price-index\">BSV</a>).
