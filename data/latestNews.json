According to Pechman, consumers built a cushion of extra cash savings as the U.S. government injected money to avoid a recession and temporarily forgave student loan repayments.</p><p>But, according to investment bank JPMorgan, “consumers have spent down the entirety of their excess savings from the pandemic, which at one point totaled more than $2 trillion,” as <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-consumers-spend-down-excess-pandemic-savings-2023-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a> by Business Insider. Pechman believes that if JPMorgan’s predictions are correct, the stock market should have been trading much lower. Still, Pechman doesn’t think that betting against the S&amp;P 500 is sound advice, given that inflation is right around the corner and the government will be forced to inject liquidity to avoid a recession.</p><p>For the show’s next topic, Pechman dissects the Chinese central bank’s intervention after the yuan hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar. For Pechman, the biggest risk is the market doubting the country’s ability to sustain a stronger yuan, meaning betting that the People’s Bank of China’s reserves won’t be enough to sustain the desired level.</p><p>In essence, what the Chinese central bank is doing has limits and ultimately is a risky bet, argues Pechman. For now, according to the analyst, there seems to be no imminent risk coming from the yuan, but it is worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>For further insights into these matters, tune in to the latest episode of <em>Macro Markets</em>, exclusively available on the newly launched <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@cointelegraphmarketresearch?si=_YNv_JjJB4ZeoLfl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cointelegraph Markets &amp; Research YouTube channel</a>.</p></p>\n                \n            "

According to the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CME FedWatch Tool</a>, expectations about a rate pause in September remain firm. However, the probability of a rate hike in November has grown to 41% from 32% a month ago.</p><h2>Whale dump alert</h2><p>The days leading up to the Powell speech have witnessed whales reducing their XRP exposure.</p><p>XRP supply held by addresses with a balance of more than 1 billion tokens (black) fell to 39.21% from 41% a week ago. Similarly, the supply held by the 10 million-to-100 million balance cohort has dropped 0.25% in the last four days. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/09a65f73-24c5-44c9-b5d9-e81bc4b9e7fc.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP supply distribution among entities with a 100,00-infinity token balance.

This is a classic bearish continuation pattern that forms when the price trends inside a two rising, parallel trendlines, after a strong move downside (called flagpole).</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/2efe033a-da96-498d-821d-432b92acfbdd.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bear flag resolves after the price breaks below its lower trendline and falls by as much as the flagpole's height, as shown above. Hence, the bears will hope for a possible flash crash toward $0.40 as its next downside target, or a 20% price decline by September.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-worth-less-20k-2023-us-inflation\">Bitcoin could be worth less than $20K in 2023, US inflation data says</a></em></strong></p><p>However, the bulls will pin hopes on XRP's daily relative strength turning oversold, raising possibilities of a short-term recovery toward the flag's upper trendline. In this case, XRP price has a bullish target of $0.54, or 6% gains, by the end of August.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
