    "description": "Bitcoin, the largest crypto asset, is currently at a standstill from the viewpoint of many investors considering current market factors. The crypto mostly traded between $41,000 and $45,500 last week after recovering from a brief dip below $40,000 on January 23.  Although the price action has been underwhelming, on-chain data indicates that large holders have been adding more to their wallets, bringing the total number of wallets to the highest it has been in 15 months. At the same time, the holding pattern indicates smaller whales have been adding to their holdings to join the next tier of holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Exodus: The Inside Scoop On The Massive $500 Million Weekly Flight Large Holders Accumulating It would seem Bitcoin holders have been making moves to push the cryptocurrency up, as indicated by the increasing number of whale wallets. According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the number of Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000-10,000 BTC, saw an increase of 47 more wallets representing a 2.5% growth, in six days. Consequently, the number of addresses in this tier reached 1,958 on February 1st, its highest point since November 2022. 🐳 #Bitcoin is ranging between $41K and $44K, but whale wallets are moving big this week: 🔴 Number of 1K-10K $BTC Wallets: 1,958 on Feb. 1st (Most since November, 2022) 🟡 Number of 100-1K $BTC Wallets: 13,735 on Feb. 1st (Least since November, 2022)https://t.co/MTOnjURnfV pic.twitter.com/QrxW8CH5c2 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 3, 2024 Furthermore, Santiment data showed the decline of wallet addresses in the tier below. That is, those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. The number of wallets in this range dropped by 154 addresses within the same time period, representing a 1.1% decrease. Consequently, the number of addresses in this tier fell to 13,735 on February 1st, its lowest point since November 2022.  Bitcoin currently trading at $43,055 on the daily chart: TradingView.com What Does This Say About Bitcoin? The accumulation by a vast number of large holders points to continued faith in the crypto despite the current consolidation, but whale accumulation is only one of many market factors that influence the crypto&#8217;s price. Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory might look unclear at the moment, but the macro outlook points to a positive movement on the fundamental side of things. One of these is the recent capital flows of $1.7 billion into Bitcoin spot ETFs in the past 14 days.   Related Reading: Avalanche To Unleash 9.5 Million Tokens, Traders Brace For Impact According to crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin&#8217;s current consolidation could continue in the coming months before the next halving.

According to him, Tether&#8217;s dominance chart suggests a further BTC decline to around $30,000. This price range coincides with analyst PlanB&#8217;s absolute Bitcoin price floor of $31,000.  Bitcoin 200 week moving average is 31k. When bitcoin price diverges from 200WMA, in accumulation (blue) and bull markets (orange/red), bitcoin has never gone below 200WMA. So 31k might be the absolute floor, and bitcoin might never see 31k ever again IMO.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/chainlink-news/chainlink-price-stalls-as-287-million-worth-of-link-makes-its-way-to-binance/",
    "description": "The price performance of Chainlink is one of the previous week&#8217;s biggest narratives, rivaling Bitcoin making its way above $43,000 again. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin recorded a significant 25% price increase in the last seven days. However, the price of LINK seems to be slowing down, as it keeps struggling to hold above the $18 level. While expectations are that this sluggishness will blow over soon, the question still is &#8211; why is the Chainlink price stalling? 16 Million LINK Tokens Transferred To Binance The latest on-chain revelation has offered insight into why the price of LINK is facing some form of bearish pressure. In a post on X, crypto analytics firm SpotOnChain disclosed that 19 million tokens (worth about $341 million) were recently unlocked from three of Chainlink’s non-circulating supply contracts. In a more detailed breakdown, the on-chain analytics firm revealed that 15.95 million tokens (valued at $287 million) were moved to Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange. Meanwhile, the remaining 3.05 million Chainlink (worth $54.3 million) were transferred to multi-sig wallet, 0xD50f. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Report Suggests Solana As A Main Focus For The Next Bull Market According to SpotOnChain, this is not the first time transactions involving Chainlink’s wallets and of this caliber will happen. The analytics platform disclosed that Chainlink has been unlocking and transferring some of the unlocked tokens to Binance as far back as 2022. On-chain data shows that Chainlink has unlocked a total of 106 million tokens, with 88.95 million LINK sent to Binance since August 2022. At an average price of $9.06, the entire worth of these transactions stands at $805 million. SpotOnChain noted that the last two unlocks have been followed by a slight dip in LINK’s price. The last unlock saw the Chainlink token fall from almost $19 to $17.5 on Saturday, February 3. As of this writing, the LINK token is valued at $17.86, reflecting a nearly 1.5% price jump in the past day. Chainlink Records Multi-Month High In Transaction Volume It appears that the price of LINK will not remain stagnant for very long, as the most recent on-chain data indicates that Chainlink has experienced a notable increase in network activity over the last few days. Positive network fundamentals could be all the altcoin needs to resume its bullish run.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/what-is-xrp-ledger-xrp/",
    "description": "XRP Ledger, created by Ripple Labs Inc., is an open-source blockchain technology and digital asset. This means that developers can contribute to its development and enhance its functionality. XRP serves as the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger and is the commonly recognized name for it. The XRP Ledger is purposefully designed to enable swift, cost-effective, and secure transactions. It functions as a distributed ledger, where transaction records are stored across a network of validators, which are participating computers, ensuring the integrity of the ledger. XRP has garnered significant recognition for its ability to facilitate expeditious and streamlined cross-border payments. Its primary objective is to enhance liquidity and establish connections between diverse currencies, enabling seamless value transfers for both financial institutions and individuals across international borders. Ripple, the entity responsible for XRP, has forged partnerships with numerous financial institutions to investigate the potential of XRP in the realms of remittances and international settlements. It is imperative to emphasize that although XRP is commonly linked with Ripple, the XRP Ledger functions autonomously, separate from the company. XRP can be exchanged on different cryptocurrency platforms and stored in digital wallets that are compatible with the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: What Is Kaspa (KAS) Blockchain? Additionally, there is a diverse range of cryptocurrency exchanges that support the XRP Ledger (XRP) for individuals interested in buying, selling, or trading XRP. Some notable examples include Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, Huobi, and more. Founders Of XRP Ledger (XRP) In early 2011, developers David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto were intrigued by Bitcoin but concerned about its energy consumption and scalability issues. They aimed to create a more sustainable system for value transfer. Their predictions about Bitcoin&#8217;s energy usage were proven right when estimates revealed that Bitcoin mining consumed more energy than Portugal in 2019. They also foresaw the risks of one miner or collusion of miners gaining over 50% of the mining power, which remains a concern today as mining power concentrates in China. Undeterred, the developers continued their work and created a distributed ledger called Ripple, with a digital asset initially called &#8220;ripples&#8221; (later referred to as XRP). The name Ripple encompassed the open-source project, the unique consensus ledger (Ripple Consensus Ledger), the transaction protocol (Ripple Transaction Protocol or RTXP), the network, and the digital asset.  To eliminate confusion, the community started referring to the digital asset as &#8220;XRP.&#8221; By June 2012, Schwartz, McCaleb, and Britto completed the code development and finalized the Ledger. How XRP Ledger (XRP) Works The XRP Ledger represents a pioneering blockchain technology that places a strong emphasis on scalability and interoperability. This focus enables the ledger to offer a wide array of possibilities for diverse applications that surpass the realms of traditional financial systems. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Season: A Guide to Buying, Trading, And Profiting From SOL Tokens By demonstrating the capacity to handle substantial transaction volumes and foster seamless connectivity among different assets, the XRP Ledger stands poised to bring about a revolution across multiple industries and ignite innovation. Its scalable and interoperable nature creates opportunities for novel use cases and transformative solutions within the blockchain ecosystem.  Prominent Features Of XRP Ledger Consensus Ledger Functioning as a distributed and decentralized ledger, the XRP Ledger stores the transaction history across an independent network of validators. Every validator preserves a copy of the ledger, and transactions undergo validation and agreement via the consensus algorithm. This approach ensures that the ledger&#8217;s transaction history is securely stored and that transactions are verified and approved through a collaborative process among validators. By employing this distributed and decentralized framework, the XRP Ledger establishes a reliable and transparent system for recording and validating transactions. Gateways and Interoperability The XRP Ledger enables the establishment of gateways, which are entities responsible for issuing and redeeming assets on the ledger. These gateways play a crucial role in bridging various currencies and assets, fostering seamless interoperability across different financial systems. By facilitating the transfer and exchange of diverse assets, the gateways enhance the connectivity and compatibility between different forms of value representation. This feature of the XRP Ledger promotes greater efficiency and accessibility in cross-border transactions and opens up opportunities for enhanced liquidity and streamlined financial operations. Transaction Speed and Scalability Engineered with scalability and rapid transaction settlement in mind, the XRP Ledger (XRP) is adept at processing a substantial number of transactions per second. With the capability to settle transactions within a matter of seconds, the ledger is well-suited for a wide range of use cases that demand swift and efficient transaction execution. Related Reading: How To Mint BRC-20 Tokens On The Bitcoin Network Its high scalability and speedy transaction settlement empower businesses and individuals alike to conduct seamless and timely transactions, fostering enhanced productivity and responsiveness in various applications and industries. Consensus Algorithm Within the XRP Ledger, a distinctive consensus algorithm known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) is employed. Diverging from conventional proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms, RPCA relies on a group of trusted validators to authenticate and validate transactions. These validators assume the crucial role of collectively establishing consensus regarding the sequence and legitimacy of transactions on the network. By leveraging this innovative consensus mechanism, the XRP Ledger ensures the integrity and reliability of its transaction validation process, providing a secure and efficient environment for conducting business. Native Cryptocurrency (XRP) XRP operates as the inherent digital currency of the XRP Ledger, serving multiple purposes, such as facilitating transactions, offering liquidity, and bridging diverse currencies. As a medium of value exchange, XRP can be transferred between various entities on the XRP Ledger, enabling seamless transactions and facilitating the exchange of value. This versatile cryptocurrency plays a vital role in supporting the functionality and efficiency of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The Impact Of XRP On The Financial Industry Undoubtedly, the XRP Ledger, along with its native currency XRP, has made a notable impact on the financial industry, bringing forth a range of positive innovations across various important aspects such as: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) The XRP Ledger&#8217;s utilization of smart contracts and tokenization creates possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, paving the way for the development of groundbreaking financial services like lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges. With its rapid and scalable nature, the XRP Ledger provides an ideal foundation for constructing DeFi applications, potentially extending financial services to underserved communities and diminishing dependence on conventional intermediaries. Asset Tokenization The capacity of the XRP Ledger to tokenize tangible assets like real estate, art, and commodities has the potential to unleash liquidity for assets that have historically lacked it. Through the representation of these assets as digital tokens on the ledger, fractional ownership becomes feasible, enabling enhanced accessibility and transferability. This breakthrough can introduce fresh investment prospects and enhance market efficiency. Cross-Border Payments The swift transaction settlement and economical fees offered by the XRP Ledger make it an attractive choice for cross-border payments. Its efficient currency-bridging capabilities simplify and expedite international transactions, potentially reducing expenses and enhancing liquidity for financial institutions. This can result in expedited and cost-effective remittances, benefiting both businesses and individuals. Liquidity and Market Efficiency The XRP Ledger&#8217;s utilization of XRP as a bridge currency and liquidity tool has the potential to bolster market efficiency and enhance liquidity for diverse assets. By enabling seamless value exchange across different currencies, the XRP Ledger contributes to improved market liquidity, simplifying the process of buying, selling, and trading assets for users. This heightened liquidity has the capacity to foster more efficient markets and enhance the process of price discovery. Related Reading: How To Create And Mint Your Own NFTs On The Ethereum Network XRP Distribution And Price Dynamics  The distribution of XRP tokens by Ripple Labs is a nuanced process that goes beyond a simple monthly release schedule. Currently, the majority of XRP is held in 16 escrow contracts, and their release is influenced by multiple factors, such as market conditions and ecosystem adoption. The original 55-month distribution projection was an estimate, and Ripple has the ability to adjust the pace based on their assessment. Certainly, this distribution strategy impacts the price of XRP. A significant influx of XRP could potentially exert downward pressure on its value. However, attributing price fluctuations solely to this factor would be narrow-minded. The overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, demand from financial institutions, regulatory developments, and news related to Ripple all contribute significantly. To truly understand the price action of XRP, a comprehensive analysis of these intertwined factors is necessary, recognizing the intricate interplay between Ripple&#8217;s distribution strategy and the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. Tokenomics Of XRP Supply XRP has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, making it a pre-mined cryptocurrency with no possibility of additional token creation. Only a fraction of the tokens are actively traded, while 20 billion went to the founders. The distribution involves 55 smart contracts that release 1 billion tokens monthly over 55 months, resulting in a monthly increment of 1 billion tokens. The circulating supply is around 53.7 billion tokens, with the remaining held in escrow. Source: Messari on X Over 60% of the total supply is concentrated in the top 100 wallets, raising decentralization concerns. Ripple owns 6.5 billion XRP, adjusting the circulating supply to approximately 47 billion tokens. XRP exhibits a mild deflationary trend from burning fees, reducing the total supply to about 99,988,221,902 XRP. Buying XRP Coins Purchasing XRP coins can be a relatively straightforward procedure; however, the available choices cater to diverse levels of experience and comfort. Here is a breakdown of different approaches tailored to meet your specific requirements: Beginner-Friendly Exchanges Coinbase and Binance are user-friendly platforms suitable for newcomers. They provide intuitive interfaces, clear instructions, and customer support to assist users throughout the process. Related Reading: What Are The Top 8 DeFi And Web3 Wallets To Use In Crypto? Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Exchanges Platforms like Paxful are P2P exchanges that enable direct XRP purchases from other individuals. This decentralized approach offers privacy and flexibility but requires caution when evaluating counterparties and following safety measures. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)  Uniswap is an example of a DEX platform that operates on blockchains. They facilitate direct peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries, providing enhanced security and control over funds. However, using DEX platforms will require compatible wallets. Tracking Prices of XRP Ledger (XRP) To effectively track the prices of XRP Ledger (XRP), the digital asset native to the XRP Ledger, and stay up to date with its market movements and fluctuations, there are several reliable methods and platforms that you can utilize, such as widely recognized cryptocurrency tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap is a highly regarded platform for monitoring cryptocurrencies, offering extensive data on a diverse range of digital assets, such as XRP Ledger (XRP). Users can explore the XRP page on CoinMarketCap to access up-to-the-minute price updates, historical data, market trends, and other pertinent information relating to XRP. CoinMarketCap serves as a trusted resource for individuals seeking to track and analyze the performance of XRP Ledger within the global cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: How To Buy, Sell, and Trade Tokens On The Arbitrum Network Ripple Lawsuit With Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) The Ripple vs. SEC legal dispute, which began in December 2020, has a profound impact on XRP. The SEC accuses Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through XRP sales, while Ripple argues that XRP is a utility token for cross-border payments and not a security. This ongoing battle has caused turbulence for XRP, resulting in price volatility and adoption uncertainty. The outcome of the case will have significant implications for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency industry. The lawsuit has led to a hesitant market as businesses and individuals are cautious about embracing XRP due to the uncertainty surrounding its classification. The resolution will determine whether XRP&#8217;s utility as a token will prevail or if the SEC&#8217;s classification as a security will cast a long shadow over its future. As the market awaits a definitive answer, the trajectory of Ripple&#8217;s digital creation remains uncertain. Conclusion XRP Ledger (XRP) boasts an established name, a decentralized network, and lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. This has cemented its role as a preferred bridge currency for cross-border payments. Despite facing legal challenges, XRP has an impressive track record as one of the pioneering cryptocurrencies, gaining widespread adoption among major financial institutions through RippleNet. The community&#8217;s dedication and the project&#8217;s foundational strengths provide a solid basis for potential success. However, the outcome of the SEC lawsuit will be a crucial determinant in shaping the future of XRP, whether it will be positive or negative. Related Reading: How To Buy And Trade Tokens On The SEI Network Nevertheless, navigating the world of XRP necessitates careful consideration. While some may prioritize user-friendly platforms for entry, experienced traders might seek advanced features offered by decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

    "description": "As the eagerly awaited Bitcoin halving event approaches in April, cryptocurrency analysts are engaging in spirited discussions about the potential trajectory of the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Offering his insights, Michaël van de Poppe, the founder and CEO of MN Trading, has shared his predictions, outlining a period of consolidation before potential growth, with a particular emphasis on the anticipated outperformance of certain altcoins. Related Reading: Avalanche To Unleash 9.5 Million Tokens, Traders Brace For Impact Bullish Long-Term Outlook Amidst Short-Term Consolidation Van de Poppe envisions a phase of consolidation for Bitcoin in the upcoming months, with a suggested price range oscillating between $48,000 and $50,000 leading up to the halving event. My general theory is that #Bitcoin is consolidating in the coming months. Pre-Halving a final run towards resistance at $48-50K, after that another correction to $36-38K and from there #Altcoins to continue outperforming Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/sYiqpg3T93 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 3, 2024 However, he cautiously warns of the possibility of a further correction, potentially driving the price down to a range of $36,000 to $38,000 before witnessing a rebound. This aligns with his previous statements expressing a keen interest in accumulating more Bitcoin within this specified range. Despite these short-term predictions of consolidation, Van de Poppe maintains a bullish stance on Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. He boldly projects a potential future price of $300,000, echoing the prevailing optimistic sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. This optimistic outlook is not unique to Van de Poppe, as other analysts also express similar enthusiasm, with price predictions ranging from $170,000 to a staggering $1 million post-halving. Bitcoin slightly below the $43K level today. Chart: TradingView.com In an intriguing twist, Van de Poppe suggests that while Bitcoin experiences this period of consolidation, certain altcoins, namely Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH), may potentially &#8220;outshine&#8221; Bitcoin. This implies an anticipation of their growth rates surpassing those of Bitcoin. Notably, Dogecoin (DOGE) has already displayed bullish momentum, seemingly validating these projections. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $43,097, and its next move is crucial. If it breaks above $43,375, it might surge further, finding resistance at higher levels. On the downside, there&#8217;s a solid support around $42,940, backed by the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a neutral market, hovering around 54, without a clear direction. Traders are closely watching for a potential breakout above $43,375, which could trigger a bullish rally, or a drop below $42,950, indicating a bearish trend. The market is at a pivotal point, and significant price action could follow.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/kaspa/what-is-kaspa-kas-blockchain/",
    "description": "The Kaspa (KAS) blockchain is a decentralized, open-source, and scalable Layer-1 solution often referred to as &#8220;Bitcoin 2.0&#8221; or &#8220;the next Bitcoin.&#8221; However, Kaspa is unique in its own way despite functioning very similarly to Bitcoin. Just like Bitcoin, Kaspa is a proof of work (PoW) cryptocurrency, but unlike other traditional blockchains, Kaspa implemented the GHOSTDAG protocol. This protocol is unique in the fact that it does not have orphan blocks created in parallel. Rather, it allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. This makes Kaspa the first of its kind to do this, with the blockDAG (Block Directed Acyclic Graph) protocol being a generalization of Nakamoto’s consensus. The Founder And The Team Behind The Kaspa (KAS) Network The founder of Kaspa is Yonatan Sompolinsky, a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Havard University and a member of the Maximal extractable value (MEV) research team. He was also in Ethereum&#8217;s whitepaper and rumored to be in Ripple&#8217;s whitepaper as well. Related Reading: How To Buy And Trade BRC-20 Tokens On The Bitcoin Network Sompolinsky had direct input in creating Ethereum&#8217;s technology design, having designed the GHOSTDAG protocol earlier. Interestingly, the founder&#8217;s 2013 paper on the GHOSTDAG protocol is cited in Ethereum&#8217;s whitepaper. The development team is made up of very talented individuals such as Cryptography Researcher Elichai Turkel, Doctoral student Shai Wyborski, Developer Ori Newman, Master of Computer Science Michael Sutton, and Developer Mike Zak. They have all contributed to the implementation and ongoing development of the Kaspa blockchain network. Differences And Similarities Between Kaspa (KAS) And Bitcoin (BTC) At the very base of its technology, Kaspa is very similar to the Bitcoin network in the way it’s structured. Some of these similarities are outlined below: Utility: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 blockchain solution that functions as a store of value, often referred to as digital gold, functioning as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Likewise, Kaspa is a Layer 1 solution purported to be a store of value and functioning as peer-to-peer cash. Related Reading: What Are The Top 8 DeFi And Web3 Wallets To Use In Crypto? Limited Total supply: Bitcoin has a maximum total supply of 21 million BTC to be ever mined, meaning new coins can never be created after all of these coins are mined. In a similar fashion, Kaspa has a maximum total supply of 28.7 billion coins, with a little over 22.5 billion in circulation.&#160; Halving Events: Both Kaspa and Bitcoin undergo halving, which slashes the block rewards for miners in half. However, while Bitcoin undergoes a halving event every four years, Kaspa uses a Chromatic Halving Schedule, “meaning that rewards smoothly decrease every month in a quantitative manner that results in a 50% emission reduction per annum,” according to its website.&#160; Decentralization/Proof of work: Both blockchains employ a decentralized proof of work mechanism, meaning that the network is secured by miners who solve complex mathematical equations to mine blocks and confirm transactions. Unfortunately, this also means that both networks are energy-intensive and require a lot of power to run.&#160; One major difference between both networks is that Kaspa solves the issue of scalability that continues to plague Bitcoin. This means that while both networks use a proof of work mechanism, Kaspa is able to carry out transactions at a faster rate as well as cheaper fees. How Does Kaspa The Blockchain Solve Trilemma Issues? The Blockchain Trilemma refers to the three critical aspects of blockchain technology, which are security, scalability, and decentralization. This trilemma continues to plague leading blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they continue to battle these issues. This is because, in order to ensure security and decentralization, something had to give, and in both cases, it was scalability. Related Reading: Crypto After Death: How Do You Pass On Your Investments To Your Loved Ones? However, Kaspa, on the other hand, is one of the few blockchains to solve the blockchain trilemma, as it is decentralized, scalable, and secured. It solves the blockchain trilemma issues through its integration of proof of work (PoW) and the blockDAG structure. Image source How Does The Kaspa GhostDAG Protocol Work? Most blockchains that digitally process transactions do so in the form of blocks, hence the name blockchain. Kaspa, however, deviates from this because it does not store digital transactions in blocks. Instead, it does so using a complex mathematical structure called a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).  In a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), vertices are present instead of blocks. So, instead of referring to different units as forming blocks, each different vertice forms edges when connected to each other. The blockchain then relies on present transactions to validate and confirm transactions that come after it.  Kaspa does not discard previous blocks of information; therefore, it is more secure and scalable. Its mining relies on kHeavyHash, which is a form of optical mining algorithm that is energy efficient and works well with mining equipment such as FPGAs and GPUs. Prominent Features Of Kaspa (KAS) Efficient Proof of Wook: Kaspa is a one-of-a-kind blockchain that has managed to maintain its Proof of Work mechanism while also solving the blockchain trilemma. To put this in perspective, blockchains such as Ethereum have had to move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in an effort to solve their scalability issues and make them faster.  However, since Kaspa already solved the blockchain trilemma, this makes it highly scalable while maintaining a truly decentralized system. Its utilization of the optical-mining-ready kHeavyHash algorithm also helps to ensure the consensus and security of the network. Related Reading: How to Buy, Sell, and Trade ERC-20 Tokens on the Ethereum Network Instant Transaction Confirmation: Kaspa was designed to be cheaper and faster than Bitcoin, where full confirmation of a transaction takes an average of 10 seconds, with each transaction visible to the network in one second. This is significant when compared to Bitcoin, which takes an average of 10 minutes to confirm a transaction. Security: When it comes to security, Kaspa did not just employ the same security principles and methodology as Bitcoin, it took it a step further as it replaced the SHA-256 PoW encryption with kHeavyHash, while inheriting all the security properties of SHA-256. Thus, its network is still secured by a robust network of decentralized volunteers (miners) who validate and sign transactions just like Bitcoin. Cheaper Fees: Not only does the Kaspa Blockchain network confirm transactions fast, but it is also significantly cheaper than Bitcoin. This is because the blockDAG network generates multiple blocks every second for posting transactions to the ledger, whereas Bitcoin generates one block every 10 minutes. Transaction fees on Kaspa cost less than a cent, while transaction fees on Bitcoin cost an average of $4 at the time of this publication. Scalability: Kaspa solves scalability issues with its blockDAG network&#8217;s ability to generate and confirm multiple blocks per second, as mentioned above. But perhaps the most interesting part of what Kaspa does is that it is able to confirm so many blocks (vertices) per second without altering or giving up its decentralized nature. What Is KAS Coin And What Are Its Uses? KAS coin is the native token of the Kaspa blockchain, whose main objective is to power the whole network. It is used to pay for transaction fees and other forms of developer&#8217;s fees, and it is also used as an incentive to reward miners. Its block rates are rapid and promise swift rewards, as well as offering profitable mining with lower hash rate requirements compared to Bitcoin. The Tokenomics of Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa’s native cryptocurrency, KAS, has a maximum or total supply of 28.7 billion coins that are not pre-mined. This means all of the tokens in circulation have been free-mined by miners on the blockchain. It has a circulating supply of 22.5 billion at the time of publication, and estimates are that with the current halving model, the last KAS coin will be mined in 2037.  Related Reading: How To Mine Bitcoin And Crypto &#124; Guide The Kaspa network utilizes an open crowdfunding and voting governance model, which means that KAS holders can contribute to the network for development, marketing initiatives, education, etc.  This sense of shared responsibility and ownership motivates the community to come together and work toward collective goals.  KAS Price History And Progress Kaspa launched its mainnet along with its token two years ago, on November 7, 2021. Initially, the price of its native token, KAS, remained stagnant until July 2022, when it pumped from $0.0001840 to $0.0005890. It then traded sideways for months before going on another rally, triggering a 694% increase in price. Related Reading: When Is the Next BTC Halving Date? Bitcoin Halving Guide Following this, the KAS price rose to almost $0.01 per coin in just a year after its launch in November 2022. The price dipped a bit and started off trading 2023 with $0.005278 per coin. KAS would then go on to hit a new all-time high of $0.154 in November 2023, exactly two years from the month it launched. Kaspa (KAS) is up 61,331% since its all-time low of $0.00017105 on May 26, 2022, according to Coingecko. This is significant because the surge to its new all-time highs took place during a bitter bear market, causing the coin to outperform the rest of the crypto market. This immense growth in such a short time has led to some of Kaspa’s investors referring to it as ‘Bitcoin 2.0’ or ‘The next Bitcoin.’ Its similarities with Bitcoin have also fueled the belief that it is the next Bitcoin. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, Kaspa is currently the 38th-largest cryptocurrency in the space and the 7th-largest Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) solving the blockchain trilemma with the ability to be scalable and still be decentralized gives it an edge over blockchains such as Bitcoin. Its native KAS coin also has important use cases like powering the entire Kaspa blockchain protocol and being used for transaction fees. This ensures that the coin is always in demand as the Kaspa network usage grows.

    "description": "Bitcoin SV (BSV),  a hardfork of the Bitcoin token, has drawn much attention in the last day after top American exchange Coinbase announced its termination of support for the asset. Following this news, BSV’s price has taken a hit, falling by over 5% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Positive Performance In Q2 2024: Coinbase Analysts Coinbase Ends Support For Bitcoin SV In an X post on February 3, Coinbase shared that it had officially withdrawn support for BSV on its platform. This announcement follows a previous post in December when the exchange first communicated its intentions to delist BSV. According to Coinbase, all BSV remaining in customers&#8217; wallets have been liquidated and replaced with the equivalent market value of another asset. However, the exchange states that certain wallets may not receive any compensation assets due to the transaction costs associated with the liquidation and replacement process.  As a reminder, any BSV funds in your Coinbase account have been liquidated and converted to the equivalent market value of another supported digital asset and credited back to your account, minus any transaction costs. — Coinbase Assets 🛡️📞 (@CoinbaseAssets) February 3, 2024  As of now, Coinbase has provided no official reason behind its decision to remove BSV from its coin offerings. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin SV has been a rather controversial asset since its creation in 2018.  Notably, the BSV blockchain network has been subject to multiple 51% attacks in the past due to its rather “centralized” structure, which serves as a source of concern to many exchanges. Aside from Coinbase, other top exchanges that have delisted Bitcoin SV include Binance, Kraken, Bittrex, Robinhood, etc.  Furthermore, the token’s founder Craig Wright has continuously drawn criticism to himself for claiming to be the anonymous inventor of Bitcoin &#8211; Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2022, Wright filed to obtain the Bitcoin copyright and block the operations of the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin Cash claiming a violation of intellectual property.

    "description": "Ethereum (ETH), the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen a significant exodus from centralized exchanges in recent weeks, with data suggesting a growing preference for holding the asset outside of trading platforms. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,289, down 0.7% in the last 24 hours, but managed to gain 1.6% in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Avalanche To Unleash 9.5 Million Tokens, Traders Brace For Impact Ethereum Outflow Hits $1.2 Billion According to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, a staggering $500 million worth of ETH exited exchanges last week, contributing to a total outflow of $1.2 billion for the entire month of January. This represents a major shift compared to previous months, raising questions about the motivations behind this trend. $500M in $ETH was withdrawn from CEXs this week, adding to a total of over $1.2B in outflows in the last month pic.twitter.com/e8NFOGtrDV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 2, 2024 CryptoQuant data paints an even starker picture, showcasing a dominant pattern of outflows since the beginning of January. The chart reveals a persistent decline in exchange holdings, with the last inflow recorded on January 30th. At the time of writing, the outflow continues unabated, with over 3,000 ETH leaving exchanges every hour. However, the impact on overall exchange supply is not entirely uniform. While the total amount of ETH held on exchanges initially increased in January, reaching around 10.7 million by mid-month, it subsequently dipped to 10.3 million by January 28th. Currently, the supply has resumed an upward trend, sitting at around 10.6 million. Binance ETH Exodus: Investors&#8217; Strategic Moves Interestingly, the historical balance of ETH on Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, tells a different story. Despite the overall uptick in exchange holdings, Binance has witnessed a consistent decline in its ETH balance throughout January. From a peak of over 3.9 million ETH on January 23rd, the balance has shrunk to around 3.7 million, indicating that users are actively withdrawing their Ethereum from the platform. Ethereum currently trading at $2,288.5 on the daily chart: TradingView.com While the exact reasons behind this trend remain unclear, several possible interpretations emerge: Increased Investor Confidence: Moving ETH off exchanges could signal a growing sentiment among investors to hold the asset for the long term, potentially driven by confidence in its future potential. Additionally, some investors might be transferring their ETH to DeFi platforms for staking or yield farming opportunities. Market Uncertainty: The recent outflows could also reflect broader concerns about market volatility or potential regulatory changes, prompting investors to seek safer storage for their holdings. Binance-Specific Dynamics: The decline on Binance might be due to factors specific to the exchange, such as user preferences for alternative platforms or changes in its trading fees or policies.
