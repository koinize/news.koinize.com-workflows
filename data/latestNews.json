In an interview with Cointelegraph Tiago Sada, head of product at Tools for Humanity the company behind Worldcoin, said the company anticipates these types of integrations to accelerate in the coming months. </p><p>Sada said that since its launch it has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-biz-worldcoin-plans-open-source-data-microstrategy-preps-btc-halving\">opened up its software development kit (SDK)</a> for any developer to be able to use it last Monday and also has integrated with the platform Discord. </p><blockquote>“Over the coming weeks and months - during the second half of the year- we expect to spend a lot more time helping companies set up these integrations.”</blockquote><p>Last week, Reuters reported that Worldcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/worldcoin-to-allow-government-and-businesses-to-use-id-system\">plans to expand its services</a> to allow governments and organizations to utilize its software. Sada explained to Cointelegraph, given that it is an open identity protocol, built on top of zero-knowledge proofs anyone can choose to use it and is subject to the same rules of the protocol.</p><p>This includes governments, which he pointed out have had issues with ID verifications, due to the availability of duplications and fakes on the black market. </p><p>“We're not trying to replace a passport or driver's license,” he clarified. “This is something that you can use in addition to that.”</p><blockquote>“We've been approached by governments over the past few months inquiring about how the protocol works, but no specific integration to announce right now.”</blockquote><p>On the other hand, some governments have been openly looking into Worldcoin due to concerns for privacy and data collection. The data watch for the German government <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-government-watchdog-launched-worldcoin-probe\">launched a probe into Worldcoin</a> back in November 2022, prior to the official launch. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/french-privacy-watchdog-questions-worldcoin-s-data-collection-method-report\"><strong><em>French privacy watchdog questions Worldcoin’s data collection method: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>Sada also highlighted that historically, there has always been a struggle with the notion of building applications that are “bot-resistant”. Now with the age of artificial intelligence (AI), it will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/worldcoin-launches-token-to-distinguish-humans-from-bots\">become a much more difficult</a>, yet important problem to solve.</p><blockquote>“It is clear that the world needs and will need something like Worldcoin in the coming years. We just hope that happens in a privacy-preserving decentralized, open source permissionless way.”</blockquote><p>The explosion of interest in and accessibility of AI tools and applications has already caused concerns over the<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/worldcoin-launches-token-to-distinguish-humans-from-bots\"> possibility of rampant fake news</a> and deep fakes. </p><p>On July 3, AI-generated fake news circulated which resulted in<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gary-gensler-resigns-ai-generated-fake-news\"> rumors of the resignation</a> of United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler.</p><p>Already Worldcoin has deployed at least 1,500 metal orbs for in-person scans and sign-ups in physical locations around the world including major cities like London, Paris and Dubai. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-human-digital-souls-agi-alignment-problem-replika/\"><strong><em>Experts want to give AI human ‘souls’ so they don’t kill us all</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Curve Finance, a popular decentralized (DeFi) protocol, has recently announced that it was rewarding persons capable of identifying the exploiters behind the draining of over $61 million from the platform’s stable pools on July 30.  The huge bounty offer is open to every person who can pinpoint the individual behind the incident in such a way that would lead to definitive legal repercussions.  Curve Finance Extends Bounty Offer to the Public Curve Finance announced the public offer using an Ethereum transaction’s input data, noting that the allowed time for the voluntary return of the funds connected to the Curve exploit was 08:00 UTC, and that time is now elapsed.  Related Reading: Crypto Funds Vs Bitcoin Holders: Who Was The Better Performer In H1 2023 Curve and other protocols that were affected by the attack had previously offered a 10% bug bounty to the hacker on August 3. Upon agreeing to the offer, the hacker returned part of the stolen assets to JPEGd and Alchemix but did not refund other affected pools.  Since the time allowed has elapsed, Curve announced that any person capable of identifying the hacker would receive assets worth $1.85 million. This recent announcement was extended in scope to include members of the general public.  According to Curve, while the deadline for the voluntary return of stolen funds had passed, should the hacker elect to return the stolen funds, the platform “&#8230;will not pursue this further.”  While returning the parts of the funds earlier, the hacker left a message that was seemingly targeted at Curve and Alchemix teams, noting their intention to return the funds. However, the hacker stated that the decision to return such funds was not based on fear of being recognized but rather out of a desire not to “ruin” the projects associated with the exploit. CRV price stalls at $0.61 following exploit &#124; Source: CRVUSD on Tradingview.com The $61 Million Reentrancy Attack Members of the Curve Finance community were left shocked after a hacker utilized vulnerable versions of the Vyper programming language to implement reentrancy attacks on stable pools within Curve Finance on the 31st of July.  The attack drained Curve Finance of over $61 million, including $13.6 million from Alchemix’s aIETH-ETH, $11.4 million from JPEGd’s pETH-ETH, and $1.6 million from Metronome’s sETH-ETH. The event raised concerns about the likely fallout in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially with respect to the risks posed to every pool using Wrapped Ether (WETH). Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Race Gets Hotter As SEC Receives 11 Filings In One Week The DeFi community rallied around to provide support to Curve Finance and on the 31st of July, a white hat hacker was able to successfully recover from the exploiter about 2,879 Ether worth about $5.4 million, which was later returned to Curve Finance. Another ethical hacker also recovered about 3,000 ETH and refunded it to Curve Finance’s deployer address.  Featured image from Zipmex, chart from Tradingview.com"
