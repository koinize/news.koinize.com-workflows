While speaking as a guest on Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Hayes said that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hit-750-k-to-1-m-2026-arthur-hayes\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hit-750-k-to-1-m-2026-arthur-hayes/amp\">Bitcoin’s price could reach $750,000 to $1 million</a> by 2026. Hayes argues that incessant money printing by the U.S. government to avoid a financial crisis will trigger a massive bull market in several asset classes.</p><p>Several analysts are bullish about the long-term but the near-term remains uncertain due to various headwinds. Could Bitcoin and altcoins stage a recovery or will they continue moving lower? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>After finding support at the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,227) for the past two days, Bitcoin broke below the level on Oct. 11. This shows that the bears are trying to seize control.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/17b4e1ce-fe6a-4290-a417-d1c62feb4548.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The next support to watch on the downside is the 50-day simple moving average ($26,615). If this level cracks, it will suggest that the traders are rushing to exit. The BTC/USDT pair could then slump to $26,000 and eventually retest the support at $24,800.</p><p>If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will attempt to propel the price above the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a potential rally to $28,143.</p><p>The flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint suggest a possible range-bound action in the near term.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) has been finding buyers near the $1,531 support for the past two days, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the price will continue to swing between $1,531 and $1,746 for some more time.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/4721937b-dbc5-40c5-b0a2-06abac89e327.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The positive divergence on the ETH/USDT pair suggests that the selling pressure may be reducing near $1,531. This may start a relief rally, which could reach the 20-day EMA ($1,619). If the price turns down from this level, the bears will make another attempt to yank the pair below $1,531 and start a downward move to $1,368.</p><p>Contrarily, a rise above the moving averages will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to $1,746. The bulls may find it difficult to break above this level but if they do that, the pair could climb to $1,961.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) fell below the uptrend line on Oct. 9 but bounced off the strong support at $203. This indicates that the price is range-bound between $203 and $220.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/78077037-b145-4433-9bb7-909d58bf90ed.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The long wick on the Oct. 10 candlestick indicates that the bears are selling the rallies to the moving averages. The bears again redoubled their efforts to strengthen their position by dragging the price below $203.</p><p>The next trending move is likely to begin on a break below $203 or on a rally above $220. If the $203 support gives way, the BNB/USDT pair may crash to $183. On the contrary, a rise above $220 could open the doors for a potential rally to $235 and thereafter to $250.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>Buyers could not build upon the breakout above the symmetrical triangle and overcome the barrier at $0.56. This shows that XRP’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) demand dries up at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/67bcea06-5a7b-4b50-b3d5-cfaddd3d7cd9.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The price turned down and broke below the moving averages on Oct. 9. This was the first indication that the bulls have given up. The selling picked up further on Oct. 11 and the bears pulled the XRP/USDT pair below the uptrend line. This suggests that the pair may extend its stay between $0.41 and $0.56 for some more time.</p><p>On the downside, the first support is at $0.46 and after that at $0.41. Contrarily, attempts to start a recovery are likely to face selling at the moving averages and then at $0.56.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) is one of the stronger major cryptocurrencies as it is trading above the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($21.79).</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/41f551c4-8be2-4df1-9ee0-aa5b9845efa7.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price turns up from the current level, the SOL/USDT pair will attempt to form a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern. This reversal setup will complete on a break and close above the neckline. The target objective of this setup is $32.81 but its efficacy reduces slightly as it has formed inside a consolidation.</p><p>If bulls fail to start a strong rebound off the 20-day EMA soon, the bears will be strengthened. They will then try to tug the price to the 50-day SMA ($20.44). If this level gives way, the next stop may be $18.50 and later $17.33.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>The bears dragged Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) back below the moving averages on Oct. 9, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/c6f186c7-50f4-46d8-a2f7-66ab1b0a511c.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The ADA/USDT pair could retest $0.24, which is an important support to keep an eye on. The positive divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls are likely to protect the $0.24 level with vigor. They will then have to drive the price above the moving averages to signal further strength.</p><p>Contrarily, a break and close below $0.24 will indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair may first skid to $0.22 and eventually to $0.20.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) plunged and closed below the $0.06 support on Oct. 9, indicating that the bears are in charge.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/7c359386-8829-4a67-b274-586515eee3d4.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The long tail on the Oct. 9 candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support at $0.055. If buyers want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price back above the breakdown level of $0.06 and then extend the recovery over the moving averages.</p><p>If they fail to do that, the bears will continue to put pressure on the $0.055 support. If this level cracks, the DOGE/USDT pair could retest the pivotal support near $0.05. This level is again expected to attract solid buying by the bulls.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jp-morgan-debuts-tokenization-platform-tcn-blackrock-key-client-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/jp-morgan-debuts-tokenization-platform-tcn-blackrock-key-client-report/amp\"><strong><em>JPMorgan debuts tokenization platform, BlackRock among key clients: Report</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls failed to sustain Toncoin (TON) above the 20-day EMA ($2.06) on Oct. 7, indicating that the bears are selling on relief rallies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/5227aeb2-89bb-4d86-9b45-ae576887e4cc.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ALTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have managed to keep the TON/USDT pair above the 50-day SMA ($1.96). The buyers will next try to clear the overhead hurdle at the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the TON/USDT pair could rise to $2.18 and subsequently to $2.32.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair could start a downward move toward $1.60. </p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>The bears made their move on Oct. 9 and yanked Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) below the vital support at $3.91. The bulls tried to push the price back above the breakdown level on Oct. 10 but the bears held their ground.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/f65ee941-fc71-4ac4-aae2-9e0f2215a81c.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOTUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Selling resumed on Oct. 11 and the bears are trying to sink the price toward the next target objective at $3.50. Although the downsloping moving averages indicate that bears remain in command, the positive divergence on the RSI offers a small ray of hope for the bulls that a reversal is possible.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $3.91. That may trap the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The DOT/USDT pair will then attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($4.16).</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) turned down and broke below the moving averages on Oct. 9, indicating that the $0.49 to $0.60 range remains intact.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/90409873-2813-4f21-9bff-bca0099c2a33.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AMATICUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Losing the 20-day EMA ($0.53) support is a negative sign and it puts the onus on the bulls to defend the crucial support at $0.49. If the price rebounds off this level, it will indicate that the bulls remain buyers on dips. That could keep the MATIC/USDT pair stuck inside the range for a while longer.</p><p>This neutral view will invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and plummets below $0.49. The pair will then indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend toward $0.45.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description": "Savvy crypto investors—often dubbed &#8220;crypto whales&#8221; due to their sizable holdings, which can influence market trends have recently been setting their sights on a select group of altcoins, potentially aiming to capitalize on their prospective gains. Recent developments, such as the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) hint at pausing rate hikes and speculations around the approval of more futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., are suspected to be the catalysts steering crypto whale interests, according to Marti, a recognized voice from the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel. Notably, Macroeconomic events have always played a critical role in shaping the dynamics of the financial markets. Cryptocurrencies, while unique in their operations, are no exception to this influence. Related Reading: MakerDAO Secures $6 Billion For Treasury Bill Investments As MKR Dominates 2023 LINK: Chainlink&#8217;s Surge Attracts Big Crypto Players Chainlink&#8217;s native coin, LINK, is turning heads and emerging as a prime focus for these heavyweight investors. Marti identifies LINK as one of September&#8217;s top performers among leading cryptocurrencies, registering roughly 30% growth. Marti says this gain can be attributed to several developments, including Chainlink&#8217;s tokenization collaboration with SWIFT, the international payment rail, and a growing interest in the real-world assets sector. Whale activities around LINK have also been quite noteworthy. On-chain data by IntoTheBlock reveals a jump from 30 whale transactions on September 17 to 218 by October 2. A notable transaction involved a purchase of 424,443 LINK tokens, a transaction value of about $3.25 million. This whale spent $3.25M to buy 424,443 $LINK again at a price of $7.67 an hour ago. Which caused the price of $LINK to increase again.https://t.co/pRCcK2tQAa pic.twitter.com/VHe2CTrBTi — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 8, 2023 Diving Deeper: The Rise Of MKR And BCH Maker (MKR), another altcoin, has experienced a significant uptick in large-scale transactions, coinciding with the Fed&#8217;s rate halt announcement in September. Marti sheds light on the surge in whale activities around MKR, highlighting that significant transactions leaped from nine on September 19 to a 6-month high of 102 by October 2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a staple in the crypto realm, hasn&#8217;t been left out of the whale frenzy either. Marti parallels BCH&#8217;s current scenario and its June 2023 bull rally, which propelled BCH to a yearly zenith of $329. Recent on-chain data underscores this enthusiasm, showing whales&#8217; noticeable accumulation in BCH holdings. From September 21 to October 4, there was a notable increment in their total balances, suggesting an acquisition of an additional 150,000 BCH. Furthermore, while LINK, MKR, and BCH have seen positive price trends over the past month—mirroring the whale accumulation metrics—each has also faced its share of downturns. Related Reading: 81 Binance Wallets Withdraw $31 Million In LINK, What This Mean For The Altcoin Notably, LINK and MKR emerged as the top performers among the trio, registering monthly gains of 24.8% and 27.3%, respectively. In comparison, BCH posted a modest rise of 16.2%. Yet, it&#8217;s worth noting that over the past week, all three altcoins have experienced declines: LINK decreased by 4.4%, MKR by 2.2%, and BCH by 6.2%.
