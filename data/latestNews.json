This suggests investors are moving toward safer assets over non-yielding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/f8ad596a-cc04-43f9-93c5-4a79b6a84d26.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield vs. BTC/USD daily performance chart.

I pity them,\". Addressing the Ethereum comparison, the founder said:</p><blockquote>\"Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can't change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\"</blockquote><p>\"Cardano's sidechain plans mutually benefit both Cardano and the sidechain,\" he stated.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s getting delusion town now.

With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second.\"</blockquote><p>In an ask-me-anything session dated November 2021, Hoskinson <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-prepares-to-scale-with-hydra-upgrade-as-network-reaches-2m-wallets\">revealed</a> that the Hydra project was still under development with no set launch date. The first mainnet-compatible Hydra node was released on May 11, 2023. Since then, developers have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1677656537840644096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">teased</a> the upcoming Hydra Pay, a supposed layer-two integration with Cardano Wallets bearing the feature of instant settlement and \"gazillion TPS.\" </p><p>Regarding utility, data from Cardano Scan indicate that the blockchain currently processes an average of 65,000 transactions per day, or 0.75 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum processed over 1 million transactions in the past 24 hours, or about 12.45 transactions per second.</p><p>\"No matter how many times the VC coins, the cryptomedia, or the maxi crowd proclaims we are dead, irrelevant, or failing, we always remind them that Cardano is here to stay,\" wrote Hoskinson in a <a href=\"http://no%20matter%20how%20many%20times%20the%20vc%20coins%2C%20the%20cryptomedia%2C%20or%20the%20maxi%20crowd%20proclaims%20we%20are%20dead%2C%20irrelevant%2C%20or%20failing%2C%20we%20always%20remind%20them%20that%20cardano%20is%20here%20to%20stay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">previous</a> tweet. </p><p><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/banning-ransomware-payments-attractive-dangerous-idea/\">Should we ban ransomware payments?

Mark Smargon, CEO of Fuse, joins host Elisha Owusu Akyaw to discuss various Web3 payment solutions and how Fuse contributes to businesses’ adoption of cryptocurrency payments. </p><p>Smargon explained that the payment network’s strategy involves looking beyond investments to focus on everyday use cases like payments, which will likely bring more sustainable adoption. Despite the goal, Smargon recounted the difficulty in convincing people and investors that businesses would adopt blockchain payments when starting Fuse in 2019. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/2d04b857-0726-4206-a03f-e79f4abfca47.jpg\"  /></figure><p>Smargon further explained that Fuse is not competing with Ethereum but with Visa and Stripe, and that it’s intended to be the main payment layer for global transactions. On whether the battle of adoption will be won by a few blockchain networks, Smargon mentioned that Fuse has never held a maximalist mindset: </p><blockquote>“We really believe that in the future, there is going to be many blockchains. There is not going to be one blockchain that will hold the entire human knowledge. We were never maximalists in that approach.”</blockquote><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2096415\"></template><p>Smargon believes that Web3 payments have come a long way in the last two years as things like nonfungible tokens and digital collectibles have become more popular. What’s more, the increase in freelancers from developing markets who are paid in cryptocurrency and the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments have been among other catalysts spearheading Web3 payment adoption. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/banning-ransomware-payments-attractive-dangerous-idea/\">Should we ban ransomware payments? It’s an attractive but dangerous idea</a></em></strong></p><p>Owusu Akyaw asked about the impact of regulations on Web3 payments and adoption in the future. Smargon called it a rollercoaster ride, due to the unstable nature of regulations across the globe. He also added that blockchain technology may need to evolve by adding new features and taking away some existing features to fit regulations and create a better connection with traditional finance. </p><p>Listen to the latest episode of <em>Hashing It Out</em> with Fuse CEO Smargon on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ibvcrJ87PAso4DBIiE5qn?si=5071800991044f7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hashing-it-out/id1658998696?app=podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yMDk2NDE1LnJzcw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Google Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/Hashing-It-Out-p3083469/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TuneIn</a>.
