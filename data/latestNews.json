The estimations also suggested that the number of such professionals stood at just around 73,000 people in 2019.</p><p>According to the data, the crypto industry peaked in terms of total staff numbers in 2021 at more than 211,000 professionals. The growth came alongside Bitcoin’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/clear-skies-for-bitcoin-price-discovery-if-giant-70k-btc-sell-wall-is-scaled\">all-time high price of $68,000</a> that was recorded in November 2021.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/252517bb-b2f4-4e28-9c06-8709733a6fcc.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cryptocurrency employment by years. Source: K33</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although crypto-focused employees have reduced by around 11% since 2021, the number of crypto professionals is still significantly higher than four years ago. This increase appears to track the dynamics of Bitcoin’s price, which <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">surged</a> more than 300% from its average annual price of around $7,200 in 2019, according to CoinGecko.</p><p>Data from some major industry companies reflects K33’s findings, though others appear to be trailing. One of those adding to its global headcount is major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which has seen staff numbers rise more than 150% since 2019, the firm’s chief people officer Pranesh Anthapur told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“Bear markets reinforce the importance of securing the right talent to scale your operation. Disrupting the foundations of traditional finance isn’t easy,” Anthapur noted. He added that Kraken’s approach to staff retention remains “consistent between bear and bull cycles.”</p><p>Trezor, a major hardware wallet firm, has also increased the firm’s headcount by 120% since 2019, CEO Matej Zak told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“More importantly, we are focused on building and retaining talent for the long term,” Zak noted. He added that Trezor has been moving to retain and improve talent even in bear markets, as opposed to cyclical hiring and firing based on “short-term market frenzies.” He stated:</p><blockquote>“We've been in the industry for 10 years, so we're well aware of how tough bear markets can be, and we plan accordingly. This means we didn't have to cut staff during the recent bear market, instead, we continued to hire.”</blockquote><p>On the other hand, the cryptocurrency industry has also seen multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year, including at firms like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-cut-another-20-of-its-workforce-in-the-second-wave-of-layoffs\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-plans-new-round-of-layoffs-to-address-increased-regulatory-scrutiny\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-ceo-announces-20-staff-cut-did-not-account-for-ftx-collapse\">Crypto.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/dapper-labs-cut-staff-layoff-amid-nft-contraction\">Dapper Labs</a> as well as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-cuts-workforce-by-30-in-an-effort-to-survive-crypto-winter\">Kraken</a>.</p><p>According to online reports, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-headcount-reduction-hits-1-000-employees-report\">Binance has reportedly laid off more than 1,000 employees</a> in its recent headcount cut over the past few weeks. The alleged layoffs came after the firm <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-plans-new-round-of-layoffs-to-address-increased-regulatory-scrutiny\">announced a 20% reduction in staff</a> in May.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/searches-for-ai-jobs-in-2023-4x-higher-than-crypto-jobs-when-btc-hit-69k\"><strong><em>Searches for ‘AI jobs’ in 2023 are 4x higher than ‘crypto jobs’ when BTC hit $69K</em></strong></a></p><p>While some major firms have been laying off thousands of people, some crypto giants have apparently never employed more than 100 people. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin and the most-traded cryptocurrency, USDT (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>), only has about 60 people working at the company, a spokesperson for the firm told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“We have always maintained a cautious approach to hiring.

    "description": "Elon Musk has consistently proven to be a pivotal figure in cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin (DOGE), his crypto of choice. His influence on DOGE has been nothing short of remarkable, with any mention or action from him causing significant fluctuations in its price. In the digital currency landscape, where DOGE has struggled to keep pace with its counterparts despite the recent positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies, any movement on the meme coin carries a heightened significance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Encounters Familiar Resistance, Prompting Concerns About Bull Run Enthusiasts eagerly await every word uttered by Musk, recognizing the potential impact his statements can have on the price and overall market sentiment. Given this context, what did Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX top honcho and Twitter owner, say this time, and how did it reverberate within the DOGE community? Elon Musk ‘Doges’ Preference Boosts Dogecoin Price Musk recently responded to a question on a popular social media platform. The question was about his preference between cats and dogs, and the enigmatic billionaire, promptly answered, &#8220;Doges.&#8221; This seemingly innocuous response had an immediate impact on the price of the meme coin. Doges — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 17, 2023 Following Musk&#8217;s endorsement, Dogecoin experienced a surge in its price on Monday, with a notable 3% gain. Its trading value climbed from $0.07 to $0.073, reflecting the enthusiastic market response to Musk&#8217;s statement. The sudden price increase further solidified the significance of Musk&#8217;s influence on Dogecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. DOGE to USD gets a little boost. Source: CoinMarketCap However, as of the time of writing, the initial excitement has subsided, and DOGE’s price on Coingecko has adjusted to $0.070024. Despite the slight dip from the peak, the meme coin still managed to record a modest increase of 0.5% within the last 24 hours. Over seven days, Dogecoin showcased a more promising rally, with a substantial gain of 8.2%. Source: Coingecko Crypto Trading Expert Foresees DOGE Breakout Meanwhile, crypto trading expert Ali Martinez recently took to Twitter to share his prediction that Dogecoin is on the brink of a breakout, presenting an opportunity for investors. Leveraging an analysis of critical resistance levels and historical data on address accumulation, Martinez foresees a potential 10% price surge if DOGE surpasses the significant $0.75 supply wall. #Dogecoin is trying to break out! Slicing through the $0.75 supply wall will trigger a 10% upswing to $0.85, where 176,000 addresses had previously purchased over 12.34 billion $DOGE. pic.twitter.com/RJw7v7q30X — Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2023 His insightful analysis suggests that breaking through the $0.75 supply wall can catalyze a notable upswing in Dogecoin&#8217;s price, propelling it toward the $0.85 mark.
