A final decision is yet to be made, but the U.K. Treasury is expected to announce the new rules as soon as next week.</p><p>The new provisions would reportedly force banks to give customers three months’ notice before closing their accounts. Additionally, banks will be required to provide an explicit reason for closing down accounts and customers will be granted the right of appeal.</p><p>The move comes in the wake of a dispute between politically conservative former politician Nigel Frarage and the U.K. private bank Coutts — which boasts British royal family members as clients.</p><p>Coutts closed Farage’s bank accounts earlier this month, saying his account had fallen below its threshold but leaked documents later revealed it was because his conservative views did not “align with [their] values.” </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12314423/The-Coutts-Farage-dossier-bank-admitted-ex-Ukip-leader-DID-meet-commercial-criteria-used-tweet-Ricky-Gervais-trans-joke-Novak-Djokovic-ties-decide-odds-position-inclusive-organisation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">documents</a> obtained by Farage and shared by the Daily Mail, detailed the minutes of a Coutts meeting concerning his accounts.</p><p>In the meeting, Coutts officials called Farage a “disingenuous grifter” and cited the \"reputational risk\" associated with his political views as the reasons for closing his accounts.</p><p>U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was “wrong.” He added “no one should be barred from using basic services for their political views.
