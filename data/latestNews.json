    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/",
    "description": "Yesterday, the Bitcoin price journey resembled a high-intensity rollercoaster ride, initially soaring past the $73,000 mark before encountering a tumultuous liquidation event. This event saw over $361 million worth of leveraged trades unwound, compelling the BTC price to retract sharply to below $68,300. The drastic price fluctuation primarily affected long position holders‚Äîinvestors who speculated on a continued price rise‚Äîwith a staggering $258 million wiped out. Subsequently, Bitcoin&#8217;s price staged a remarkable V-shaped recovery, during which short sellers found themselves on the losing end, with just over $103 million in positions liquidated. This data by Coinglass marks the event as the most significant purge of long positions since March 5. At that time, Bitcoin experienced a decline to $60,800 following its climb to a then all-time high of approximately $69,000. Bitcoin ETFs Register Record $1 Billion Inflows Perhaps spurred by the opportunity presented by the price dip, investors in spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) engaged in a buying spree, unprecedented in its intensity. For the first time, spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a daily inflow surpassing $1 billion on Tuesday, March 12, primarily driven by an inflow of $849 million to BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT. According to detailed data released by Farside Investors, the total net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs were at $1045 million (or $1.045 billion). Related Reading: Expect A Bitcoin Scarcity Crisis In 6 Months, BTC To $100,000? The second largest Bitcoin ETF to date, Fidelity, saw a rather quiet day¬† with FBTC taking in only $51.6 million, while Ark Invest ($93 million), Bitwise ($24.6 million), Valkyrie ($39.6 million) and VanEck ($82.9 million) saw relatively strong capital inflows. Notably, Grayscale&#8216;s GBTC saw a waning outflow of just $79 million. Bitcoin analyst Alessandro Ottaviani shared his insights on X, underscoring the magnitude of these inflows, &#8220;1 Billy of Total net Inflow! ONE BILLION DOLLARS! [&#8230;] In the last twelve trading days, The Nine inflow has been $9.2b, with an average of $768m per day.

So&#8230; probably HIGHER. If this continues, $80-90k by the end of month is not far fetched. No correction has lasted longer than 24 hours on the weekdays. Interestingly, the first major correction of the 2021 cycle came when price went 2x previous ATH. So could we see no major correction until $120k?‚Äù At press time, BTC already surpassed the $73,500 mark and traded at $73,392. Featured image created with DALL¬∑E, chart from TradingView.com"
