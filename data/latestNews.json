He explained: </p><blockquote>“It turned out that players are quite familiar with the blockchain gaming industry, and a significant portion of them already play Web3 games and have even engaged in NFT trading from games.”</blockquote><p>Because of this, the game vendor launched G2A Geekverse to provide an online space for fans of Web3 games. Skwarczek added that within this space, gamers will \"find information about the best Web3 games” and “have the opportunity to buy and sell digital assets associated with these games.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cross-platform-nfts-dream-roblox-ceo\"><strong><em>Roblox CEO 'dreams' of in-game cross-platform NFTs and digital objects</em></strong></a></p><p>Traditional gaming distributors have been warming up to Web3 gaming since 2023.
