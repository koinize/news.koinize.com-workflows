According to him, it took the fintech giant 13 years to reach 100 million daily users. \"If Ethereum was day zero for smart contracts (2015) then it may take a similar time frame for blockchains to reach similar level of adoption,\" he added. </p><p>Keeping the current pace of adoption, blockchain-based companies may also see a rise in valuations. Coutts noted that basic regressions show the blockchain ecosystem could be valued between $5 trillion to $14 trillion once 100 million users are onboard. \"Thats up from $350b today.\"</p><p>Coutts projections are consistent with data suggesting sustained interest in blockchain technology. In spite of the market downturn, development in the crypto industry <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-things-crypto-2023-winds-end\">rose 5% in 2022.</a> Additionally, a survey conducted by Celent in 2022 showed that 91% of institutional investors are interested in investing in tokenized assets — blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership of physical and digital assets. </p><p>\"While overly simplistic extrapolations such as this should never be soley relied on for valuation purposes it, the exercise illustrates that users and prices are inextricably linked and that as adoption continues prices are likely to track much higher for some assets,\" Coutts predicted.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ethereum-restaking-blockchain-dangerous/\"><strong><em>Ethereum restaking — Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
