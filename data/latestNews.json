    "description": "\n<p>At some point in every trader&rsquo;s journey, the concept of portfolio diversification becomes a mainstay. It&rsquo;s a mandatory lesson for life if you&rsquo;re interested in having the best shot at success and having that elusive result only a small portion of traders end up having &ndash; more profits than losses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In today&rsquo;s world of high inflation, increasing interest rates and strained geopolitical tension, opening positions across a variety of different asset classes is more important than ever. The Exness Trade App makes this task seamless and convenient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a one-stop-shop platform, the app offers the entire A-Z trading journey, from sign-up to withdrawal. More importantly, it offers a diverse range of instruments, including a bountiful selection of cryptocurrency CFDs alongside the more traditional markets. Unlike some other trading apps on the market, Exness Trade provides a comprehensive trading experience for anyone looking to put their eggs in as many baskets as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why having the crypto trading option matters&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exness opens the door to the next level of portfolio diversification &ndash; the ability to spread your capital across a very wide range of crypto prices against the USD, Gold, the Aussie Dollar, and more. Exness Trade App gives access to all of the broker&rsquo;s cryptocurrency products through its MT5 trading accounts. That means you can trade the price of 25+ crypto CFDs on offer against the US Dollar &ndash; from the biggest market players in Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum to the lesser-known 1inch, Polkadot, and Elon Musk&rsquo;s favorite Dogecoin. Exness is also one of the very few brokers who offer you the opportunity to trade Bitcoin&rsquo;s price against metals like Gold and Silver.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond having access to such an impressive portfolio of cryptos, trading with Exness Trade App comes with a whole slew of features that can propel your crypto trading to new heights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Features for an immersive crypto trading experience</p>\n<p>What makes the Exness Trade App really stand out is the way it allows users to monitor and analyze their trading performance, as well as its customization capabilities. Since there is such a large collection of cryptocurrencies on offer, you have options to tailor your app experience so that you keep quick track of the cryptos you care about.</p>\n<p>For example, in the Performance section, you can analyze your overall trading history for instruments like BTCXAU, BTCUSD, DOTUSD, DOGEUSD, and ETHUSD in terms of profit and loss by looking at different time periods and time categories. Four different time periods &ndash; 7, 30, 90, or 365 days &ndash; and three different time categories &ndash; General period, Time intervals, or Data slices &ndash; help you perform a deep dive into your profitable and non-profitable historical crypto orders.</p>\n<p>Sifting through all the instruments in the app is made much easier by the three different ways you can view them:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Favorites &ndash; you can tag any crypto instrument you&rsquo;d like as a favorite, such as BTCXAU, DOTUSD, or DOGEUSD, and it will be grouped here.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Popular &ndash; a category that is automatically updated based on the overall number of orders from all Exness traders. See how popular crypto trading is with other traders and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Top movers &ndash; a list that is refreshed every time the app is loaded, featuring 10 instruments with the highest percentage of daily price changes (top five bullish and top five bearish). Keep an eye out for any big movers in the crypto market here.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the ultimate personalized experience, crypto traders can set up personalized push notifications on the Exness Trade App, as well as bid and ask price alerts, for specific cryptocurrency CFD instruments or events. Multiple alerts can be set up for a single instrument, such as BTCUSD or ETHUSD, and the app stores a history of your alerts until you decide to clear it. This way, you&rsquo;ll never miss a minute of the crypto market action that you care about the most.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond these stand-out features, the Exness Trade App also offers more standard, but extremely useful, tools to help you navigate the crypto markets. Things like margin, swap, and spread calculators, economic calendars, trading signals, and the latest news help you hone your trading strategies, while different chart layouts, popular indicators, and the ease of setting up take profit and stop loss orders help to sharpen the technical side of your trades.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trading the more traditional markets for next-level diversification</p>\n<p>Besides cryptocurrency CFDs, the Exness Trade App also caters to traders interested in more traditional markets, or those looking to diversify their portfolio beyond just crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users can access a vast array of CFDs in forex, metals, indices, energies, and stocks. Metals, for example, include a range from the most popular Gold vs. USD (XAUUSDm) with an extended swap-free option, to the rare Palladium (XPDUSDm) that you won&rsquo;t find with many other brokers. This kind of versatility applies to all the other asset classes, allowing traders to capitalize on a multitude of opportunities across different market sectors and adapt their strategies according to changing market conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exness has built an app that ensures a comprehensive trading experience, whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned crypto trader, a beginning trader, or anyone in between.</p>\n<p>To learn more, visit https://www.exness.com/exness-trader-app/ and get all of the app&rsquo;s specifics in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "The crypto market has shown signs of recovery over the last week, with top coins trending to the top of their range. However, the picture could turn red in the short term for some altcoins as unlocks season kick-off. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Dilemma As New Addresses Take Conflicting Positions As of this writing, Ethereum trades at around $1,900 with sideways price action in the last 24 hours. In the past week, the cryptocurrency traded in the green but has been outperformed by altcoins, such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and its synthetic version Lido Staked Ether (stETH). Crypto Unlocks Jeopardize Altcoin Sector According to an analyst at Scimitar Capital, the native token for the Ethereum-based scalability solution Optimism (OP) and the native token for the Sui Network (SUI) are poised for a major retrace. These two tokens will unlock a big chunk of their supply soon. In the past, any uptick in circulating supply for a token led to increased selling pressure in the market. The more supply, the less demand for the crypto, which translates into downside price action. The analyst claims that SUI will see a 13% unlock on its market capitalization, meaning $67 million in the token, at current prices, is about to enter the market. On the other hand, OP is about to see a spike of over 110% in its market cap. In other words, around $580 million in OP will flood the altcoin market; according to the analyst, the likely scenario is for the token to succumb to downside pressure: Optimism has a massive unlock this week with over 114% of the current circulating supply unlocking. All else held equal, this means the token should trade much lower than it is now, as price is a function of supply and demand more supply = lower price. If the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can’t push upside and break out of their current range, then SUI and OP are likely to re-test critical support. Other altcoins could face a similar fate as market conditions worsen. Unlocks Season Hints At Bearish Pressure, But Shorting Is A Bad Idea? However, the team behind Optimism announced an important upgrade for the network. The second layer solution will lower fees and increase performance one week after unlocking the OP supply. There have been other announcements regarding the state of this network and its development. The analyst believes that this is part of a strategy to offset the unlocks and warn traders against shorting the token, despite the unfavorable conditions: (…) consider who you are trading against the investors and team are incentivized to coordinate and fuck over presellers as much as possible. Do you really want to pvp vs a16z and paradigm and the optimism insiders? As mentioned, SUI is likely also to continue seeing downside price action. Despite unlocking fewer tokens than OP, the Sui Network team has a weaker strategy to counter the potential selling event, which could provide a better opportunity for traders.
