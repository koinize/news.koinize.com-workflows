Best described as a mixed media artist, the Californian resident is a true OG of the NFT scene, with his work dating back to 2018, including the iconic themed Decentral Eyes, Sellout and, more recently, a collaboration with Snoop Dogg. </strong></p><p>His distinct 3D stereoscopic work jumps off the screen, and, similar to the likes of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-art-pioneer-upload-brain-internet-live-forever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Josie Bellini</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/rich-rekt-rich-again-nft-creator-trevor-jones-right-royal-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Trevor Jones</a>, Coldie leans into crypto culture  the good, the bad and everything else in between. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Decentral-Eyes--Vitalik-Buterin.gif\" alt=\"Decentral Eyes  Vitalik Buterin  Variant 02 by Coldie\" class=\"wp-image-20850\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Decentral Eyes  Vitalik Buterin  Variant 02 by Coldie (SuperRare)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Art is history. Its visual history. As I got deeper into the crypto culture on my journey, I was trying to be somewhat of a historian of the time, creating pieces that were contextual to what was going on, whether it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Vitalik</a> [Buterin] or John McAfee. Or later on, [Edward] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Snowden</a> and [Warren] Buffett. To me, it was like a time capsule I was trying to create in real-time. </p><p>When I look back to 2018, I remember <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aantonop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Andreas Antonopoulos</a> doing speaking tours and McAfee talking about eating his junk. That was amusing to me, so it made it easy to make art about. It was a lot of fun. </p><p>Coldie says it didnt take long to understand the basic fundamentals of NFTs and blockchain technology. Then he discovered you could put art on it.</p><p>Then the whole unlock of royalties and provenance. Those two things alone are revolutionary. I didnt know if it was going to hit or not, but I felt it was going to give digital artists a chance, and if collectors could understand it, too, then there was a viable chance that it could take off, says Coldie. </p><p>Paying homage to other early motion experimenters, Josie Bellini and Trevor Jones, Coldie also emphasized the impact of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beeple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Beeple</a>s NFTs. </p><p>Since Beeple came in, theres been so much stuff popping up. That was a major inflection point where there was a lot more motion graphics than the early days where it was more like animated GIFs. Today, theres more long-form storytelling. I guess its just an evolving space. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Proof-of-Work.jpg\" alt=\"Proof of Work  Variant 1 by Coldie.\" class=\"wp-image-20852\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Proof-of-Work.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Proof-of-Work-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Proof of Work  Variant 1 by Coldie (SuperRare)</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"h-personal-style\"><strong>Personal style</strong></h2><p>Coldie pioneered 3D stereoscopic work, and the iconic Coldie signature is instantly recognizable. </p><p>I consider myself a mixed media artist, but its collage art. Im always searching for the illusion of depth in my art. Ill be layering things but then taking it from the flat plane and then spacing it out so you can get a depth.</p><p>A lot of my early stuff I did, I did things with 3D glasses, but when I came into the NFT world, most people didnt have 3D glasses at their computer. So, I kind of evolved my art into 3D animated motion to show people the movement without them having to put the glasses on. </p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><p>Just two weeks ago, Coldie did a collaboration drop with ClickCreate titled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Coldie/status/1664018507821092864?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Flow State</a>, which sold out 180 pieces as a relatively inexpensive entry to collecting Coldie art (between 0.042 ETH and 0.069 ETH), but it was a mad dash to the finish line with an impending deadline. </p><p>I spent about four hours and retooled the whole thing. Its like a puzzle, you know, so its always evolving, but with a deadline, its great because you have to get it done. This allows for a kind of loose and organic result, says Coldie. </p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW ART RELEASE<br><br>Flow State<br>Edition of 180<br>Now minting for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clickcreateio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >@clickcreateio</a> sub pass holders<br>.042 ETH<br><br>The remaining will be available tomorrow at 3p ET<br>.069 ETH<a href=\"https://t.co/oHOSBf63EZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >https://t.co/oHOSBf63EZ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rTYpjVs3b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/rTYpjVs3b3</a></p> Coldie (@Coldie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Coldie/status/1664018507821092864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> </p><h2 id=\"h-decentral-eyes-dogg\"><strong>Decentral Eyes Dogg </strong></h2><p>In the mad celebrity rush to get a piece of the NFT action in 2021 and early 2022, many athletes, musicians and entertainers fell on their faces, damaging their reputations in the process by deploying misguided cash grabs from fan bases. </p><p>There were, however, a handful of celebrities who got it, and one of those was rap legend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Snoop Dogg</a>. Snoop and his inner circle, including his son, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/champmedici\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Champ Medici</a> and manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickyads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Nick Alder</a>, have been big proponents of Web3 culture. </p><p>When Coldie was put in touch with Snoop, they vibed, and their values aligned, and as a result, the <a href=\"https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/decentral-eyes-dogg-30778\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Decentral Eyes Dogg</a> collaboration was born in November 2021.

To that point even back then, there had been cash grabs with celebrities who just wanted to get a million dollars and leave, Coldie stated. </p><p>I told Snoop how I work and wanted none of what had happened with other celebrities previously, and he was totally cool with it. I did the animation in the piece and ended up writing the lyrics for the audio component of the artwork as well. When I look back, it was crazy, what an opportunity that I got to write lyrics for Snoop Dogg. </p><p>It was a great way to get my artwork in front of a lot more people. I run into people randomly that arent associated with NFTs necessarily and tell them I was behind the Snoop piece, and they normally respond holy shit, Ive seen that! so that tells me this artwork found itself outside of the ecosystem bubble that we all live in.</p><h2 id=\"h-notable-sales-to-date\"><strong>Notable sales to date</strong></h2><figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" data-id=\"20851\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Decentral-Eyes-Dogg.jpg\" alt=\"Decentral Eyes Dogg\" class=\"wp-image-20851\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Decentral-Eyes-Dogg.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Decentral-Eyes-Dogg-169x300.jpg 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Decentral Eyes Dogg  sold for 188.800 ETH ($754,300 equivalent on the date of sale) on Dec. 4, 2021 (SuperRare)</em></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"601\" data-id=\"20864\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Almost-There-by-Coldie.jpg\" alt=\"Almost There by Coldie\" class=\"wp-image-20864\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Almost-There-by-Coldie.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Almost-There-by-Coldie-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Almost-There-by-Coldie-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Almost There  sold for 135 ETH ($417,639 equivalent on the date of sale) on Aug. 26, 2021 (SupeRare)</em></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"453\" data-id=\"20849\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dalai-Lama.jpg\" alt=\"Dalai Lama\" class=\"wp-image-20849\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dalai-Lama.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dalai-Lama-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Dalai Lama  Decentral Eyes  Variant 01  sold for 120 ETH ($372,200 equivalent on the date of sale) on Aug. 13, 2021 (SuperRare)</em></figcaption></figure></figure><h2 id=\"h-influences\"><strong>Influences</strong></h2><p>Coldie has his own flavor but cites traditional artists Andy Warhol (American visual artist, producer, and leader in the pop art movement) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rauschenberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Robert Rauschenberg</a> (American painter and graphic artist, pop movement) as having had some influence on his career to date, as well as notable NFT artist and the creator of Gazers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Matt Kane</a> (artist and coder). </p><p>Im rooted in and love collage. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, those people who were making pop art, had a pretty big influence on me.</p><p>Im a kid in the 90s, and thats a lot of my influence, too. I grew up with grunge music and design. Those types of things were always super important to me. I think I identify with that style  gritty and distressed imagery.</p><p>I also have to specifically mention Matt Kane; he is just a master of color and movement, and I think hes on his own level.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/us-enforcement-agencies-turning-up-heat-crypto-related-crime/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/reduction-cash-flow/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Sweden: The Death of Money?</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><h2 id=\"h-the-evolution-of-use-cases\"><strong>The evolution of use cases </strong></h2><p>Always one to be thinking at a deep level, Coldie continues to be bullish on blockchain use cases despite overall market sentiment being in somewhat of a lull. </p><p>I really think NFTs are like an attention marketplace, and its a way to reward customers and people who engage with you. We saw early on that art NFTs proved the thesis of peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>But when you take a step back, you realize there could be a whole range of other things like rewards and ticketing. There are companies working on NFT ticketing right now. Well probably end up sidestepping the word NFT, and itll just be your digital ticket thats on the blockchain. </p><p>Coldie also weighed in on the future of music incorporating blockchain tech: I collected a lot of vinyl records when I was younger, so Im a fan of the album itself. I think that we lost that once we went digital. The demand for album liner notes and awesome packaging is gone currently. </p><p>Theres certain forerunners like Snoop Dogg who was doing his cc0 music [creative commons], where you could download his music and use it all you want. Hes taken Death Row records fully on the blockchain. To me, thats a signal right?</p><p>But that signal takes time to create the ripple. If Snoop Doggs doing it, then other people start saying, Whats this all about? I think its going to bring in different mechanics with royalties and rewards where if you own the NFT, you can get into a show or theres a meet and greet. Theres all kinds of possibilities. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trust-Your-Intuition.jpg\" alt=\"Trust Your Intuition by Coldie\" class=\"wp-image-20854\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trust-Your-Intuition.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trust-Your-Intuition-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Trust Your Intuition by Coldie (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"h-hot-nft-artists-to-pay-attention-to\"><strong>Hot NFT artists to pay attention to </strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sutu_eats_flies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Sutu</a>  Artist, writer, director, collector and founder of Neonz.xyz</p><p>This guy did the CGI for the <em>Ready Player One</em> movie, and that alone was like, this guy is literally designing the art for our future.

On May 31, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-officials-sign-markets-in-crypto-assets-framework-into-law\">signed the framework into law</a>. Sweden currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU. </p><p>MiCA was <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2023:150:TOC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">published</a> in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on June 9, triggering the countdown for the law to come into effect. This means crypto businesses have set timelines to implement and comply with MiCA’s requirements. Stablecoin rules will apply from June 30, 2024, and rules for exchanges will take effect on Dec. 30, 2024.</p><p>MiCA defines a crypto asset as “a digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology.” The legislation also offers guidance on what qualifies as “cryptocurrencies” and what makes certain digital assets “tokens.” </p><p>Additionally, MiCA establishes standards for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and cryptocurrency asset issuers. Issuers of crypto assets are required to follow standards governing disclosure and openness, and offer complete and transparent information about the crypto assets they issue. CASPs must also adopt security measures and adhere to Anti-Money Laundering regulations.</p><p>The MiCA legislation establishes CASPs as separate legal entities. The service providers can obtain a license in any of the 27 EU member states and conduct business there. Service providers must be able to counteract market manipulation and abuse, and will be under the supervision of regulators like the European Banking Authority.</p><p>Stablecoin service providers will be required to provide a white paper that contains key details about the product and the key players involved in the business. The white paper must also include the terms of the public offer, the kind of blockchain verification mechanism it will use, the rights associated with the relevant crypto assets, the main risks involved for investors, and a summary to assist potential buyers in making an educated decision about their investment. </p><p>MiCA will not govern digital assets that qualify as transferable securities and behave like shares or equivalents. The EU legislation does not cover nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or crypto assets already recognized as financial instruments under current law.</p><p>Neither does MiCA regulate central bank-issued digital assets, be it the European Central Bank’s digital currency, national central banks’ digital assets or services linked to crypto assets provided by those institutions.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-eye-is-ai-a-threat-why-ai-advance/\">AI Eye: Is AI a nuke-level threat? Why AI fields all advance at once, dumb pic puns</a></em></strong></p><p>David Schwed, head of blockchain cybersecurity firm Halborn, told Cointelegraph that MiCA is a pivotal development, demonstrating that a comprehensive framework can be established to provide clear direction to specific market segments. He added that even though MiCA excludes certain aspects of crypto, such as NFTs and decentralized finance, the regulations are a significant step forward.</p><p>“This regulation is a significant step forward for the crypto community. It presents a uniform framework for all EU member states, setting a precedent that I believe, and hope, the rest of the world will take note of and consider adopting,” Schwed said.</p><h2>Europe takes the crypto lead</h2><p>The passing of the MiCA regulations into law, nearly two years after they were first proposed, has added some regulatory clarity to cryptocurrency businesses in Europe. Although not perfect, crypto companies have definite guidelines to adhere to and access the market. </p><p>In contrast to the United States, with no set legislation and growing enforcement actions against many crypto exchanges, Europe could become a more dominant crypto hotspot.</p><p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted about the recent introduction of MiCA and said there are exciting business opportunities for compliant crypto service providers in Europe. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important dates for the industry coming up, MiCA has now been published in the official journal of the EU: <a href=\"https://t.co/in3qlQO3wV\">https://t.co/in3qlQO3wV</a> <br><br>This means crypto businesses now have firm timelines to implement and be compliant with MiCA&#39;s requirements.

Still, MiCA’s influence is clear; most nations will feel pressure to adopt some form of regulation to avoid getting left behind in a sector that has growing importance.”</blockquote><p>Alex Shevchenko, CEO of layer-2 platform Aurora Labs, told Cointelegraph that implementing MiCA could “potentially influence policymakers and regulators in the U.S. to consider similar approaches, striking a balance between consumer protection and market development. As a result, this may lead to increased collaboration and harmonization efforts between jurisdictions.”</p><p>Indeed, members of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee are currently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-house-committee-releases-new-stablecoin-bill-draft\">working on a draft bill</a> that aims to establish more clear laws for certain types of cryptocurrencies and bring stablecoins under the regulatory purview of the Federal Reserve.</p><h2>Crypto legislation around the globe</h2><p>While MiCA is — for the time being — a one-of-a-kind regulatory framework that will govern certain crypto activities in 27 countries, several jurisdictions have been actively developing some form of crypto legislation in recent years. </p><p>Joey Garcia, head of regulatory affairs at Xapo Bank, told Cointelegraph that the MiCA framework is often only compared to the regulatory landscape in the U.S., which, in his view, is far too narrow a comparison in the context of the global, cross-border and digital industry:</p><blockquote>“There are many other jurisdictions. Singapore’s crypto regulations are extremely advanced and Hong Kong’s new framework took effect on June 1. Smaller jurisdictions like Gibraltar have been regulating this space since 2018, developing frameworks and guidelines around critical factors such as market integrity for crypto trading platforms, which is far more comprehensive than MiCA.”</blockquote><p>Garcia said the rest of the world could learn a thing or two from MiCA, i.e., how to adapt classic financial services principles to nascent crypto technology. He adds that regulators outside the EU “will also need to learn and develop their understanding in not only implementing standards, but also subsequently being able to actively monitor and supervise those businesses.”</p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-ron-desantis-good-for-crypto-republican-makes-bitcoin-part-of-campaign\">Is Ron DeSantis good for crypto?

Before China banned crypto-related businesses in 2021, “Hong Kong was previously home to several growing crypto startups. With greater regulatory certainty in 2023, I think more crypto startups will start considering Hong Kong as a viable option,” he said.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

It's because a lot of Bitcoin trades are block trades,” Mow said.</p><p>In mentioning Bitcoin block trades, Mow referred to private trading channels which allow investors to privately negotiate and proceed with large BTC buy or sell orders. Some of such channels include <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges\">peer-to-peer</a> (P2P) or <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-otc-trading-explained\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) deals, he noted, adding:</p><blockquote>“You kind of have this black box around Bitcoin. You don't really know how much the market is total. If Bitcoin functions as P2P, you're not going to quantifiably measure how much Bitcoin is traded.”</blockquote><p>Indeed, private Bitcoin trading channels like P2P or OTC are not included in total BTC trading volumes on major crypto tracking websites like CoinGecko. That means that Bitcoin’s daily trading volume is actually bigger than $9.6 billion <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recorded</a> at the time of writing.</p><p>“CoinGecko only tracks trades happening on crypto exchanges and does not track trades happening on P2P platforms and brokerages,” CoinGecko co-founder and chief operating officer <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2021/bobby-ong\">Bobby Ong</a> told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“P2P platforms include places such as Binance P2P, Huobi P2P, Paxful, Remitano and so on,” the executive noted. CoinGecko has no plans to track such platforms in the near future, Ong noted.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-halts-trading-for-dozens-of-usdt-btc-busd-pairs-amid-sec-lawsuit\"><strong><em>Binance.US halts trading for dozens of USDT, BTC, BUSD pairs amid SEC lawsuit</em></strong></a></p><p>Apart from P2P, CoinGecko also doesn’t record institutional trades on OTC, Ong said, adding:</p><blockquote>“Institutional trades that happen on exchanges that we track are recorded. OTC trades are not recorded as it's like a P2P trade but between large entities.”</blockquote><p>The new remarks from Jan3 CEO may imply that cryptocurrency exchange moguls like Binance or Coinbase might not dominate the Bitcoin market as much as some might think.</p><p>In January 2023, the Norwegian crypto research firm K33 Research — formerly known as Arcane Research — said that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-is-the-crypto-market-arcane-crowns-the-exchange-2022-s-winner\">Binance handled 92% of the Bitcoin spot market</a> in 2022. “No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,” the firm wrote at the time.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
