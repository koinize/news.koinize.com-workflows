    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/spot-bitcoin-etf-odds-100-matrixport/",
    "description": "Matrixport, a leading digital finance platform, today, November 22, released a comprehensive research note focusing on the significant implications of yesterday&#8217;s developments in the crypto industry, particularly regarding the prospects of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. Following the guilty plea of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the substantial financial settlements involved, Matrixport suggests that the path for approving a spot Bitcoin ETF might have become significantly clearer. The note highlights the regulatory crackdowns and compliance upgrades in the crypto sector, indicating a shift towards greater regulatory alignment with traditional financial (TradFi) systems. &#8220;Some would argue that the US agencies have cleaned up the industry this year by dismantling the US crypto-related banks, as two of them were running an internal ledger that crypto companies could use 24/7 to transfer fiat. Arguably, few (perceived) major actors are left, and with Bitcoin only declining -3.4% during the last 24 hours, the market is stomaching a major risk-off event,&#8221; Matrixport remarks. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds At 100% Now? The company points out that with stringent enforcement actions and enhanced compliance programs becoming the norm among crypto exchanges, the differentiation between regulated and non-regulated cryptocurrency exchanges may become a key metric in 2024. This shift is seen as instrumental in the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a development long anticipated by the industry. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETF Is ‘A Buy The News’ Event: Pantera Capital CEO &#8220;The result will likely be that more exchanges will enhance their compliance programs and become part of a surveillance-sharing agreement, which will be instrumental in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US,&#8221; the firm stated, adding, &#8220;With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow.&#8221; The firm believes that this &#8220;whitewashing&#8221; of the industry will not only enhance Bitcoin&#8217;s adoption by institutional players but also position it as a safe-haven asset in investment portfolios. &#8220;More importantly, this industry&#8217;s whitewashing will strengthen the Bitcoin adoption case for institutional players and will likely become a safe-haven asset in investors’ portfolios,&#8221; Matrixport predicts. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Hype: Bloomberg Intelligence Envisions $100 Billion Market With Regulatory Approval The note also touches on the anticipated sale of the FTX exchange and its potential relaunch under a US securities law-compliant management team by Q3 2024. Matrixport speculates that this could lead to significant inflows, estimated between $24-50 billion, into any US-listed Bitcoin ETF. They also note the increasing trend of crypto firms making markets on CME-listed crypto derivatives, indicating a shift from retail-focused, unregulated exchanges to those that are fully regulated and cater to institutional clients. &#8216;Dark Cloud Has Been Removed&#8217; As ETF Makes Progress Analysts and industry experts have echoed Matrixport&#8217;s sentiments. Will Clemente, a noted analyst, stated, &#8220;With resolution on Binance, just a matter of weeks until Bitcoin ETF approval now.&#8221; Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino, head of research at NewsBTC, commented, &#8220;A dark cloud has just been removed from the crypto market.&#8221; Conversely, Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer at Davis Polk, offered a more cautious view, suggesting that &#8220;It&#8217;s far more likely an ETF decision led the Binance resolution than the other way around imo. And I&#8217;m not convinced either is that likely.&#8221; Remarkably, there has been some movement in the spot ETF approval process in the last few days. Ark Invest has kicked off the third round of amendments to the S-1 filings, Grayscale had a meeting with the US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday regarding its &#8220;uplisting.&#8221; At press time, BTC traded at $36,483.
