Residents of Arkansas, however, barely had time to discuss the new legislation, which was<a href=\"https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1799&amp;chamber=Senate&amp;ddBienniumSession=2023%2F2023R#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> proposed</a>, discussed in committees, and passed by legislators within a week, from March 30 to April 7.</p><p>State Rep. Rick McClure, who authored the bill, reportedly said that \"no one spoke against this bill in committees, or on the legislative floors.\" Crypto mining companies in Arkansas include Green Digital, GMI Computing, United BitEngine, and Cryptic Farms. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/7600f768-8a8e-4caf-8f41-4a8f04c12e44.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023.

Since June, more than a dozen counties have reportedly passed noise ordinances that target data centers.</p><p>\"I also want to make the point that it's not these people stepping out on the front porch and [not] being able to enjoy a glass of tea sitting on the back porch. These people can hear this sound 24/7 from their bedrooms,\" Justice of the Peace reportedly Maree Coats said. </p><p>Despite not completely prohibiting county regulations, the new legislation prohibits local governments from discriminating against crypto mining facilities or from limiting decibel levels \"other than the limits set for sound pollution generally.\" Counties are also forbidden from rezoning areas \"with the intent or effect of discriminating against\" digital mining operations.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
