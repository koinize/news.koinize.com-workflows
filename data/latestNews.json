Despite the best efforts of the most talented computer scientists, the idea that researchers can imagine every possible harm vector before it happens is largely considered an impossibility in the field of AI. </p><p>Even when the humans interacting with AI have the best intentions, unexpected harm can arise from seemingly innocuous prompts. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/b0060d86-59de-4c4e-95fd-fba6e49b84dd.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">An illustration of the monitor in action.
