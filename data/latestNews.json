    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-ipo-wall-street-2000/",
    "description": "Pro-XRP Wall Street financial analyst Linda Jones recently shared her thoughts on a potential Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO). Specifically, she elaborated on her belief that the crypto firm was currently undervalued and how the company’s stocks could still rise before it went public.  Why Ripple’s Stock Could Be Worth 20 Times Its Current Price Linda Jones used Coinbase’s IPO as a mirror to explain why Ripple’s stock could be worth 20 times its current valuation. She noted that Coinbase was valued at $86 billion when it initially went public, and its stocks traded for as high as $429 during that period. If Ripple were to follow a similar path, then its stock price would be worth more than the $35, which it is currently valued at by private equity platform Linqto, Jones claimed.  Related Reading: Skybridge Capital CEO Reveals When Bitcoin Price Will Reach $170,000 Interestingly, the analyst factored in Ripple’s escrowed XRP holdings while trying to estimate how much the crypto firm could eventually be valued. According to her, Ripple could be valued as high as $107 billion if those escrowed funds (said to be worth $21 billion) are added to the $86 billion (if Ripple were to be valued similarly to Coinbase). Going by Jones’ analysis, Ripple having a valuation of $107 billion means that the company’s stocks could trade at $600 on the first day of being publicly listed. The analyst then went on to lay out a possible scenario where Ripple is valued at more than $107 billion, the amount under consideration.  XRP price at $0.5 &#124; Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com How Ripple Could End Up Being Worth Half A Trillion  Linda Jones also mentioned that Ripple could end up being worth half a trillion if the SEC’s case against Ripple were to end soon and XRP rises back to its all-time high (ATH). If the latter happens, Ripple’s escrowed XRP holdings will be worth around $150 billion. That could ultimately increase Ripple’s value to about $500 billion, the analyst claims.  Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Verge Of Breakout: Crypto Analyst Says Get Ready For DOGE To Pop Jones believes that Ripple being valued at $500 billion during the IPO isn’t farfetched, considering that there are companies that are already valued at up to a trillion. She further compared Ripple to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, suggesting that the crypto firm could match up to these blue chip companies.  The financial analyst’s belief in Ripple’s potential is why she boldly claims that purchasing Ripple’s stock now is a great investment, as it will only go “up” from here. She also predicts that there could be a new record for a company at its valuation, and Ripple could be that company.  Chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "Ethereum price extended its increase above the $2,320 resistance zone. ETH is correcting gains but the 100 hourly SMA might provide support and start a fresh increase. Ethereum started an extended recovery wave above the $2,320 resistance zone. The price is trading above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend lien with support at $2,325 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it manages to stay above the $2,300 level. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price remained in a positive zone above the $2,250 resistance zone. ETH cleared the $2,320 resistance to move further into a positive zone, outperforming Bitcoin. The price traded close to the $2,400 level. A high was formed near $2,390 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2,350 level. The price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,235 swing low to the $2,390 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend lien with support at $2,325 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, Ethereum is still above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,325 level. The next major resistance is near $2,350, above which the price might rise and test the $2,400 resistance. If the bulls push the price above the $2,400 resistance, they could aim for $2,450. A clear move above the $2,450 level might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,325 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,300 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The next key support could be the $2,295 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,235 swing low to the $2,390 high. A daily close below the $2,295 support might start another steady decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Level – $2,300 Major Resistance Level – $2,325"
