    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whale-6-billion-in-btc/",
    "description": "The crypto community&#8217;s attention has been drawn to a Bitcoin whale who recently moved a huge portion of their BTC holdings across different wallets. This action has sparked the curiosity of those in the community about the reason for these transactions.  Bitcoin Whale Moves $6 Billion In BTC Blockchain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence first brought this occurrence to the community’s attention when it mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin address (37XuVSE) had moved over $6 billion in BTC to three new addresses.  Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC’s Shocking $2 Billion Demand As part of the transactions, $5.03 billion worth of BTC was sent to one of these addresses (bc1q8yj), while the two other addresses (bc1q6m5 and bc1q592) received $561.46 million and $488.40 million worth of BTC respectively. Arkham added that one of the wallets (bc1q592) has since then proceeded to transfer the received funds to another wallet.  Notably, the wallet which moved $6 billion in BTC was before now the fifth richest Bitcoin address having held over 94,500 BTC in its wallet. As of now, it still holds 1.31 BTC in the wallet in question. Interestingly, before now, this address was dormant as it had not moved any of this BTC which it received since 2019.  Transactions of such magnitude are always sure to cause a stir in the crypto community, considering the impact such whales can have on the market. Usually, a move like this can cause community members to speculate that the whale may be looking to offload their tokens and take profits. However, the fact that these transactions weren’t made to exchange-linked wallets has quelled such speculations.  Another BTC Whale On The Rise Bitcoinist recently reported on BlackRock’s Bitcoin wallet, which has continued to accumulate Bitcoin at an astonishing rate due to the impressive demand for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Despite just launching this ETF in mid-January 2024, BlackRock now holds 243,126 BTC for the fund.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 800% To $6, Here’s When BlackRock’s BTC holdings has seen it rise to becoming one of the largest corporate BTC holders, only behind centralized exchanges Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase and fellow Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale. A sustained demand for the IBIT ETF could however see BlackRock surpass these entities at some point.  That is also something that could reflect positively on Bitcoin’s price seeing as how instituitional demand for the flagship crypto has helped propel it to new highs.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,500, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap. BTC price recovers above $71,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview.com"
