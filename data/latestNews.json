    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/cardano-ada-updates-system-to-node-8-1-1",
    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Cardano, a leading proof-of-stake blockchain platform, has launched an important update to its network, Node 8.1.1.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">This update builds upon the foundational aspects of its predecessor, Node 8.0.0, and introduces several technical enhancements to the Cardano ecosystem, in particular for the ouroboros-network used for P2P topologies that don't yet contain DNS names.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">One of the major improvements brought by Node 8.1.1 is the enhancement of node performance at epoch boundaries. In Cardano's blockchain system, an epoch refers to a reward cycle lasting approximately 432,000 slots, or around five days. During these epochs, ADA tokens are staked, and new blocks are produced on the network. By optimizing the performance at these boundaries, the new update ensures a smoother transition between epochs and a more efficient rewards cycle.</p>\nTechnical Improvements and Innovations\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The Node 8.1.1 update also addresses issues related to peer-to-peer network communications and the Cardano-based domain name system (DNS). These improvements help boost the network's overall performance and security, reducing potential bottlenecks and enhancing the pllatform's scalability.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The new node no longer incorporates wallet or explorer functionalities. These are now managed by separate backend components that communicate with the node via local Inter-process communication (IPC), streamlining operations and making the system more efficient to avoid issues that have, in the past, damaged the Cardano blockchain.</p>\nRegulatory Challenges and Cardano's Unwavering Commitment \n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, especially from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cardano remains dedicated to its growth and development goals. The successful launch of Node 8.1.1, amidst this regulatory pressure, speaks volumes about Cardano's commitment to continually enhance its network performance and stay at the forefront of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Cardano's decision to release updates and improvements, irrespective of external pressures, underlines its resilience and its firm focus on offering a robust, efficient, and secure blockchain platform to its users.</p>\nEcosystem Growth and Market Performance Analysis\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The launch of Node 8.1.1 brings tangible improvements to Cardano's network, which could potentially have a positive impact on Cardano's DeFi ecosystem. While ADA's market price did not immediately reflect these advancements, certain market indicators suggest a potential bullish trend in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Despite a more than 8% decrease in ADA's price over the past week, indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), MVRV Ratio, and high whale activity hint at a possible bullish trend reversal. Notably, ADA's Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a possibility of a bullish crossover, suggesting that a northward price movement might be on the horizon.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Despite the immediate lack of positive impact on ADA's price, the technical advancements brought by Node 8.1.1 and the steady ecosystem growth indicate Cardano's potential for strong performance in the future. This combination of continuous network improvements and strong market indicators underscores Cardano's resilience and growth potential in the ever-evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/nansen-forecasts-conditions-for-the-next-bitcoin-bull-run/",
    "description": "The dynamics of the crypto market never cease to enthrall, with bullish rallies and bearish downturns coloring the landscape. Yet, deciphering the key factors to ignite the next Bitcoin (BTC) bull run is no easy task. However, Nansen, a leading cryptocurrency analytics firm, recently voiced its perspective on this subject. In a report published on June 20, the firm puts forth two fundamental prerequisites for the next surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value. It insists on the importance of clear United States regulations around cryptocurrency, and a demonstration that core inflation is on a downward trajectory. Regulatory Clarity And Inflation: Catalysts For The Next Bull Run? According to Nansen, US regulatory clarity could be a significant determining factor in the next bull cycle. This perspective comes amid the ongoing regulatory tensions with major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price On Shaky Ground: Market Analysts Warn Of Potential Fall To $20,000 Level Despite the uncertainties, Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has held not so badly, showing a commendable rise of more than 10% over the past week. Additionally, Nansen&#8217;s research points to the vital role of inflation. According to the crypto analytics firm, the potential for a recession appears to be receding, while persistent inflation continues to surprise. While this situation is leading to complex impacts, with non-Asian monetary policies staying tighter for extended periods, this scenario also poses increased challenges for risk assets. Nansen reported: The scenario of a recession is being pushed back, and inflation is surprising by its &#8216;stubbornness.&#8217; This creates non-linear effects, whereby monetary policy (outside of Asia) remains more restrictive for longer and in turn becomes an increasing headwind for risk assets. Bitcoin Price Action: Strength Amid Uncertainty Despite these economic and regulatory headwinds, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has exhibited resilience. At the time of the writing, BTC traded at $28,925, a more than 11% increase from its previous plummeted price below $25,000 in the past few weeks. Notably, over the past 7 days, Bitcoin&#8217;s total market capitalization experienced a boost of 11.6%, amounting to an additional $50 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $561 billion, an increase from last Wednesday&#8217;s $503 billion. Bitcoin&#8217;s daily trading volume has also surged from a low of around $7 billion last week to as high as above $20 billion in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, there&#8217;s been a decrease in crypto-implied volatility, suggesting that much of the regulatory and macroeconomic bad news might already be factored into Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Dominance Touches Two-Year Peak, Here’s Why According to Nansen, shallow sell-offs indicate that the market is absorbing the selling pressure well, which is a positive sign for the overall market strength. The analytics firm noted:  Shallow BTC sell-offs and ongoing decrease in crypto implied volatility tell us that a lot of regulatory and macro bad news are already priced in.
