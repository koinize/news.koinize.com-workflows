    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-under-pressure-doge-below-0-06/",
    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a critical juncture. The $0.06 support level, a longstanding stronghold for buyers since early June, now faces increasing selling pressure that could potentially send DOGE sinking below this key level.  Support and resistance zones, like the $0.06 mark, are pivotal in assessing the direction of price movements in the crypto world, as they often dictate the market sentiment. In recent months, DOGE has weathered a bearish trend, but this vital support level has managed to hold firm and mitigate the extent of the downtrend. Nevertheless, multiple retests of the support zone have raised concerns about DOGE’s weakening structure, signaling an opportunity for bears to capitalize on the situation. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? Dogecoin Price And Technical Indicators As of the latest data from CoinGecko, DOGE is currently trading at $0.061140, showing a modest 0.4% gain over the last 24 hours but a 1.2% dip over the past seven days. Two technical indicators, the On Balance Volume (OBV) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), provide further insight into the market&#8217;s dynamics. The OBV, which had been on an uptrend in October, has recently exhibited a drop in trading volume. This decline suggests that selling pressure has intensified in the past few hours, causing concern among investors. DOGE reached a market cap $8.6 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com The RSI, another crucial indicator, has dipped below the neutral 50 level, reaffirming the presence of selling pressure. These developments put DOGE at a pivotal crossroads, with both short-term bullish and bearish scenarios in play. According to a price report, if buyers can successfully defend the $0.06 support level, DOGE could see a short-term target range of $0.064 to $0.067. However, if sellers manage to breach this critical support, their near-term target becomes $0.055, potentially deepening the bearish sentiment. Market Volatility Vs. Derivatives Trading In addition to the price fluctuations, the Dogecoin market has been marked by considerable volatility lately. Yet, despite the turbulence, new derivatives traders have remained conspicuously absent.  Source: Coinalyze DOGE&#8217;s futures Open Interest (OI) has been hovering in the $232 million to $222 million range for the past week. Typically, rising open interest indicates an influx of new capital into the market, which often solidifies prevailing trends. However, the current trend suggests trader indifference, possibly due to the uncertainty surrounding DOGE&#8217;s immediate future. Related Reading: Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27? Traders should closely monitor whether the current key support can withstand the pressure, and the OBV and RSI indicators provide essential insights into the evolving market dynamics. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether DOGE can regain its bullish momentum or succumb to further bearish pressure.
