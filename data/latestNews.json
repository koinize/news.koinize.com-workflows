But its attempts to break above $2,000, a psychological resistance level, have witnessed strong bearish rejections multiple times.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/cef33c97-1a0c-494d-b391-2a28bd16ffc9.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USD daily price chart.

Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>In both cases, Ether appears to be in a recovery phase while eying close above its 0.236 Fib line of the Fibonacci retracement graph.</p><p>In 2018-2019, the 0.236 Fib line was near $425 and was instrumental in limiting <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-ethereum-crack-2k-eth-price-inches-closer-despite-new-unlocked-supply\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/can-ethereum-crack-2k-eth-price-inches-closer-despite-new-unlocked-supply/amp\">Ether's recovery attempts</a>. In 2023, the same line is near $2,000, enforcing itself again as a selling area and, thus, pressuring ETH's price lower.</p><h2>Stronger U.S. dollar, Bitcoin</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-does-the-u-s-dollar-index-dxy-impact-cryptocurrencies-watch-macro-markets\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/how-does-the-u-s-dollar-index-dxy-impact-cryptocurrencies-watch-macro-markets/amp\">strengthening U.S. dollar</a> has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, thus reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-danger-us-dollar-index-golden-cross\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-danger-us-dollar-index-golden-cross/amp\">prevailing negative correlation</a> between top cryptocurrencies and the dollar has been the main culprit. In 2023, in particular, the weekly correlation coefficient between Ether and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has been consistently negative, as shown below.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3940f426-19e6-4264-b79f-97e1e7a82205.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USD and DXY weekly correlation coefficient chart.

For instance, the widely-tracked ETH/BTC pair is down 20% year-to-date (YTD). </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/c641544b-24a2-46e9-8376-37374b5a8757.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/BTC daily price chart.
