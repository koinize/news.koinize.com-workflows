    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/vechain-vet-price-rally-14600/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has put out an ultra-bullish price prediction for VeChain (VET), which the analyst predicts will achieve significant gains soon enough.  VeChain To See A 140x Gain Egrag mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the VeChain token could see a 50x or 140x gain. He further highlighted how the crypto token could achieve any of this move to the upside. Analysing the chart, he stated that a 50x move could be in play if VET sees a similar percentage increase to the one that occurred around 2019.  Source: X Back then, VET is said to have seen a 5,892% increase. Egrag predicts that the crypto token could rise to $0.9 if this move is indeed in play. Meanwhile, for the 140x gain, the analyst claimed that this move could be in play if the market eventually witnesses a similar percentage increase to the one around 2021 when VET’s price increased by 14,638%. Related Reading: Pro-Ripple Lawyer Tags Poor XRP Price Performance As Unnatural, Rally Imminent? That was when the crypto token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $0.27. Egrag predicts that VET could rise to as high as $2 if this is the move that ends up materializing. This prediction also means that VET will likely see a new ATH in the next bull run.  This is not the first time Egrag has offered a bullish price prediction for the VET token. Last year, the analyst predicted that VET could rise to $1.6 based on historical patterns. This prediction came after the crypto token made an impressive surge of 77%, hitting price levels unseen since May 2022.  Big Moves Still Lie Ahead For VET IEgrag isn’t the only analyst who has recently laid out a bullish narrative for the VeChain token. Crypto analyst and YouTuber Crypto ZX also gave an analysis where he predicted that the crypto token could hit new ATHs if it succeeded in breaking certain resistance levels. One level he highlighted then was the $0.033 mark. Related Reading: Crypto Platform Which Predicted Bitcoin To Reach $50,000 Has Released A New Target The analyst had also suggested that VET was currently in a period of consolidation as it gears up for another move to the upside. On the next leg up, Crypto ZX predicted that the crypto token was going to surge above the $0.033 resistance level. The analyst further revealed that a move above that level would be vital to unlocking new highs.  Interestingly, VeChain has since risen above that level. At the time of writing, the crypto token is trading at $0.0474, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  VET price at $0.048 &#124; Source: VETUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Adaas Capital, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "The Dogecoin price has been trending sideways on low timeframes, but the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for a massive rally. The bull run across the nascent sector has been unkind to the king of the memecoins, but an analyst pointed at a potential change in direction towards a fresh all-time high. Related Reading: XRP Price Soars: Analyst Predicts Surge Beyond $200 As of this writing, DOGE has stalled at its current levels with a 2% loss over the past 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the token has recorded similar performance, but it remains green on the 2-week and 30-day horizon. Dogecoin Price Aims For The Moon? 23,000% Rally Possible According to analyst Ali Martinez, the Dogecoin price is moving with previous bullish trends. Despite the low timeframe bearish momentum, the king of the memecoins could record a new massive rally above its current all-time high near the $0.80 level. As seen in the chart below, the Dogecoin price experiences a sideways trend, which can extend to 679 days before exploding into a new all-time high. On DOGE’s weekly chart, the token records profits of 8,000% and 23,000% each time this happens. In late 2017, when the price of Bitcoin rose to $20,000, the Dogecoin price followed and broke the 679-day sideways trend with an 8,700% rally. In 2021, the memecoin experienced a similar breakout but with an even bigger rally. As the chart shows, Dogecoin might see an even bigger rally above $1 and $3 if this potential rally materializes. This price action is supported by DOGE’s capacity to move more aggressively to the upside every time it breaks the long sideways trend. The analyst stated: The price action of #Dogecoin appears to mirror patterns observed in its past bull markets. If history repeats itself, we could see $DOGE enter a parabolic breakout around April! DOGE Price On The Short-Term On low timeframes, the $0.10 level is critical resistance for the token to fulfill its bullish potential. NewsBTC reported that the cryptocurrency hints at a potential breakout, but DOGE must recover the $0.0914 area before scoring further gains.

    "description": "Outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) seem to be slowing down, as shown by the trading activity of Bitcoin ETFs. This comes as investor anxiety over Grayscale&#8217;s Spot ETF seems to finally be subsiding, with the entire ETF cohort continuing to attract huge trading volumes and rapid growth in assets under management. As a result, the GBTC saw daily outflows drop steadily over the course of the week to just $44.2 million on Friday, the lowest since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live. Outflows Drop As Grayscale&#8217;s BTC ETF Stabilizes After several weeks of elevated outflows totaling over $7.44 billion, investors pulled just $436.2 million of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust last week. Notably, the lowest daily outflow of $44.2 million came on the last day of the week. Related Reading: Solana Drops Below 100-Day MA On 4-Hour Chart, SOL Price In Danger? Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC is undoubtedly the biggest Bitcoin ETF among its cohort. This is because GBTC was launched in 2013 as a Bitcoin trust available only in OTC markets., allowing it to grow over the years as it was the only go-to for investors looking to dive into the crypto industry. However, after a lengthy regulatory procedure, the SEC finally approved GBTC&#8217;s conversion into a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, Grayscale&#8217;s new Bitcoin ETF went live on January 11, along with nine other recently approved ETFs.  GBTC held around $27 billion worth of BTC assets when it first began trading as an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Surprisingly, Grayscale&#8217;s conversion into an ETF came along with a vast amount of withdrawals from investors, and by the end of January, GBTC had witnessed $5.55 billion worth of withdrawals.  Many analysts have attributed Grayscale&#8217;s high management fees (1.5%) to the outflows. During this period, other Bitcoin ETFs continued to attract new money. BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now has over $6.64 billion worth of BTC in its ETF, followed by the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $4.73 billion. What’s Next For Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF? While last week’s outflow data is an encouraging sign for Grayscale and the wider ETF market, outflows could continue in the coming weeks. Bankrupt crypto lending firm Genesis recently received court approval to sell its $1.3 billion worth of GBTC in order to repay its creditors.  Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Are Giga-Bullish On XRP Price, Set Multiple Price Targets The prospect of a liquidation of such gravity has propelled concerns amongst investors of the potential downward implications on the price of BTC.

This optimism is further bolstered by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which currently sits in positive territory, often interpreted as a sign of bullish momentum.

    "description": "In spite of a slight adverse trend in the crypto market, XRP has been gradually rising in recent days, fueling positive and bullish predictions from market analysts to unprecedented heights. XRP Might Rally To New All-Time High Sooner Than Expected Javon Marks, a cryptocurrency expert and internet personality, has revealed his optimism towards XRP, sharing a daring prediction regarding the crypto asset&#8217;s future with the community on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Are Giga-Bullish On XRP Price, Set Multiple Price Targets According to the crypto expert, XRP might be poised to undergo a significant movement that will send prices to unprecedented heights, where he highlighted that there is a possibility that XRP can rally beyond the $200 price mark. Marks noted that the digital asset is presently experiencing &#8220;another set of higher lows&#8221; that are holding. In addition, he pointed out that &#8220;another breakout&#8221; has taken place in the XRP chart. As a result of this, XRP could witness &#8220;a massive upward movement&#8221; to New All-Time highs (ATHs), which Javon Marks expects to commence soon. The post read: A $200+ XRP (Ripple) can be possible. Another set of Higher Lows are holding and another breakout has taken place, meaning that a massive upside move to new All Time Highs can be commencing soon. The crypto analyst&#8217;s analysis aligns with a historical trend that had previously occurred in 2018, sending XRP&#8217;s price to its current ATH of $3.3. Prior to the surge, the token fell from the December 2013 high of $0.06, creating a bearish declining trendline. For several years, XRP was below this declining trendline, with two unsuccessful breakout trials during that timeframe. Nonetheless, after failing to break out twice, the coin persisted and managed to break out in 2017. After this breakout, it increased by over 63,000% to its present all-time high price of $3.3. Based on Mark&#8217;s predictions, it indicates that this precise trend is manifesting right now. However, some community members have expressed their displeasure with the analyst&#8217;s projections. A pseudonymous X user disagreed with Marks saying “It does not make any sense” given the &#8220;basic tokenomics” of the crypto asset. The Crypto Asset Poised For A Move Above $0.60 Cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez has underscored the potential for XRP to move past the $0.60 price mark. According to his post, Martinez&#8217;s position was influenced by the observation made by the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential. Related Reading: XRP Price’s 7,000% Pump: Analyst Foresees Massive Move If This Happens He stated that the TD Sequential indicator has formed a buying signal on the token&#8217;s chart. Consequently, this indicates a possible bullish momentum for XRP to move higher.  He further asserted that if it manages to maintain its weekly close above $0.57, it could serve as a catalyst for an upswing to $0.63 or even further, setting his target at $0.65  As of the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.538, demonstrating a decline of 1.39% in the past day. Its market cap is down by 1.42%, while its daily trading volume is up by over 4%, according to CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-tops-3100-mega-wedge-breakout/",
    "description": "After a prolonged period of weakness for a year and a half against the Bitcoin price, the Ethereum price is currently showing strength again and could be set for an explosive move, according to several renowned analysts. Ethereum/BTC Chart Is A ‘Stunner’ In an analysis of the ETH/BTC trading pair, renowned financial expert Raoul Pal has brought to light a compelling dual-chart pattern. The formation of both a &#8220;mega wedge&#8221; and an inner descending channel is setting the stage for what might be a significant breakout for Ethereum when priced in Bitcoin. Pal stated: The ETH/BTC chart is an absolute stunner&#8230;and ready for the next big move, the break of the mega wedge&#8230;let&#8217;s see how it pans out…. The &#8220;mega wedge&#8221; pattern, discernible on the weekly ETH/BTC chart, showcases a contraction of price movement between two converging trend lines over an extended time frame. The upper trend line, acting as a dynamic resistance, has repeatedly pushed back ascending price attempts. Conversely, the lower trend line has provided a sturdy support base. Within the boundaries of this one and a half year wedge, a more immediate descending channel has taken shape. This channel, characterized by a downward trajectory with price action making lower highs and lower lows, indicates a bearish sentiment within the overarching consolidation phase of the mega wedge. Related Reading: 800,000 ETH Flow Out Of Centralized Exchanges In 2024 – Bullish Sign For Ethereum Price? However, Ethereum&#8217;s current positioning, slightly above the upper boundary of this descending channel, implies that a breakout could be on the cards (if confirmed). As of press time, Ethereum was trading at an equivalent value of over $3,059, which translates to roughly 0.06037 BTC. The intersection of these two patterns, particularly if the breakout from the descending channel is confirmed, could be a harbinger of increased volatility and a potential trend reversal for ETH against BTC. A potential retest of the channel could catalyze a rally towards the mega wedge&#8217;s upper trend line, challenging the longer-term resistance. A successful breakout from the mega wedge could then ensue, signaling a massive bullish phase for Ethereum against Bitcoin. More Bullish Voices On ETH Remarkably, Raoul Pal is not the only seasoned analyst observing this major trend. Christopher Inks, founder of Texas West Capital stated via X: The monthly ETH/ BTC chart looks crazy bullish off the lows. Bullish SFP, volume expansion at the lows, rally into descending resistance. An impulsive break out above that descending resistance will have me looking for price to target the top of the range and, likely, new ATHs. Renowned analyst Will Clemente has also weighed in on the unfolding situation with his expert commentary, echoing the significance of the patterns observed by Raoul Pal. Clemente accentuates the breaking of a multi-year downtrend on the weekly chart, a technical milestone that carries substantial weight for market sentiment. Clemente&#8217;s analysis further deepens the plot by highlighting several key factors currently at play in the Ethereum ecosystem. First, Ethereum&#8217;s price action has revisited and swept the lows of May 2022, a move often associated with shaking out weak hands before a potential trend reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Back Above $3,000, Will FOMO Lead To Top Again? Second, the recent talk of &#8220;Ethereum obituaries&#8221; on social media timelines suggests a sentiment extreme, often seen at major turning points. Moreover, there is currently a new narrative for ETH shaping, the emergence of “restaking”. Probably the strongest catalyst for the ETH price in the coming months could be the potential approval of an spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. Similar to the Bitcoin ETF euphoria, Clemente speculates that the approval has not yet been priced in. Lastly, Uniswap&#8217;s governance proposal to switch on fees could redirect significant value to token holders, potentially adding further bullish momentum to ETH’s valuation. Clemente caps his commentary with a forecast that resonates with the sentiments of many observers: “ETH &#38; ETH shitcoin rotation is probably upon us.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,059.
