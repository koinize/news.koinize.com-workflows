Thats a big push for us at Exchange.art, but there is still a little bit of a divide, she says. </p><p>Theres just a little bit of a bias against the blockchain in a sense, and I think it’s a little bit of not understanding it. <br><br>She says often, collectors are unaware that the blockchain can be used for provenance, and artists dont realize that NFTs can be programmed to collect royalties each time a piece is sold. </p><p>Its shifting some established norms in the art world that didnt give artists enough ownership over their work, she says.  </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I try to help onboard people as well as artists or traditional art collectors. It is a process, you know, understanding what crypto is, understanding what a wallet is. </p></blockquote><p>In the traditional art world, galleries are the gatekeepers. For artists to sell works, galleries need to display them for buyers, taking commissions of up to 50% for doing so. </p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><p>NFTs help replace these gatekeepers, giving control back to artists. </p><p>Its a huge shift in terms of sovereignty and shifting it back toward artists.

Haack is a digital painter who creates in a style that resembles oil painting, as well as charcoal and pastels.</p><p>In a fascinating departure from physical art, she varies the texture of the support between canvas and paper, Karren explains, adding that digital tools enable Haack to cut, paste, rework and repeat sections to create digital pieces of fine art.  </p><p>Emerging trends in the space include artists working with different AI programs and incorporating it into their creative process to then push themselves in a way that they wouldnt have been challenged previously.</p><p>She also points to conceptual art being put on the blockchain directly, as well as the emergence of illustration as a fine art. </p><p>Finally, in this space, it has been given its due.

This book focuses on being objective and fact-based  with plenty of references to boot: 631, in fact.</p><p>This means that unless youre a history buff, it can get a little dry just talking about fact after fact. The book overcomes this with plenty of chapters and sections  meaning you can easily dip in and out, picking it back up with a fresh mind.</p><p>Theres even a handy little index at the back, in case you want to get a quick refresher on a specific company or person. Sam Bankman-Fried gets 68 mentions; the Securities and Exchange Commission, 41.</p><p>The book is great for anyone with an interest in the history of crypto. Readers need not be familiar with crypto or financial lingo to enjoy it, though a basic understanding will certainly help. </p><h2 id=\"h-memes-for-the-road\">Memes for the road:</h2><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How was your day yesterday?<br><br>Crypto Twitter: <a href=\"https://t.co/QYmHAVg3wh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/QYmHAVg3wh</a></p>— Alan Carroll (@alancarroII) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alancarroII/status/1663900156540887040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> </p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"zxx\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/2oe8JqkyLI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/2oe8JqkyLI</a></p>— bob (@serbobross) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/serbobross/status/1662870797415862275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >May 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </p><div class=\"subscribe subscribe--inner\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"subscribe__inner\"><div class=\"subscribe__content\">    <div class=\"subscribe__title display2\">Subscribe</div>    <div class=\"subscribe__desc text-l\">The most engaging reads in blockchain.
