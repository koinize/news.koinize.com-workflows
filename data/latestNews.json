The crypto juggernaut has rapidly ascended the ranks, outpacing industry stalwarts and marking its territory in the competitive landscape. As the demand for its network reached a fever pitch, developers flocked to Arbitrum, surpassing the likes of Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, and even the formidable Solana.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-prediction-etc-group-anticipates-surpassing-100000-by-2024/",
    "description": "Numerous price predictions have emerged as the Bitcoin price continues to demonstrate significant growth throughout the year, fueled by factors such as the upcoming halving event and potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Notably, the ETC Group has released a comprehensive report shedding light on the potential for new all-time highs in 2024 and an impressive milestone of $100,000 by year-end. Bitcoin Price Recovery Sets The Stage For A Promising 2024 According to the ETC Group&#8217;s recent report, 2023 served as a recovery year for Bitcoin and crypto assets, with pivotal catalysts setting the stage for the following year.  Per the report, BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing in June 2023 laid the groundwork for increased adoption of this emerging asset class in 2024 and beyond.  Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why Despite the progress made, the report highlights that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy in terms of adoption in most developed countries.  Global surveys indicate an adoption rate of approximately 18%, suggesting that roughly one in five individuals worldwide holds some crypto asset. One of the highly anticipated events expected to drive Bitcoin price appreciation is the BTC Halving scheduled for the end of April 2024. While some argue that the halving is already priced in due to its public knowledge, historical data demonstrates significant price increases following previous halvings.  Notably, the ETC Group&#8217;s base case prediction forecasts that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will reach new all-time highs in 2024 and surpass $100,000 by the year&#8217;s end. On-Chain Metrics Signal Bullish Outlook For BTC In 2024 Several on-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin&#8217;s supply is scarcer this cycle than the previous one.  According to the report, key indicators such as the percentage of exchange supply at a 5-year low and the all-time high percentage of supply in the last 1+ years suggest a potential bull market with increased distribution of accumulated coins to new investors.  Additionally, macro factors, including the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a likely US recession, a reversal of monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, contribute to a favorable outlook for the Bitcoin price in 2024. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target A major point of discussion among investors revolves around the potential price impact if a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved in the US. The report highlights that variations in global Bitcoin ETP flows have explained approximately 40% of Bitcoin&#8217;s price variation over the past six months.  Assuming that 20% of investors would consider such an investment and allocate 3% of their assets under management (AuM) to Bitcoin, an estimated $33.5 billion of new capital could enter the market.  This influx of funds, almost doubling the global Bitcoin ETP AuM, could lead to a price impact of around 98%. Overall, the ETC Group&#8217;s in-depth analysis and predictions suggest an auspicious year for Bitcoin price 2024. With anticipated new all-time highs and the possibility of surpassing $100,000 by year-end, Bitcoin&#8217;s growth trajectory shows no signs of slowing down.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/curve-founder-moves-over-23-million-crv-to-binance-is-it-time-to-take-profit/",
    "description": "Curve Finance founder Michael Erogov has moved over 23 million CRV, the native governance token of the Curve DAO, to Binance, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency exchange, over the last five days, The Data Nerd, on December 27, shows. The founder moved 2.5 million CRV on December 27. This transfer may ruffle investors, raising concerns because it could indicate that Erogov is likely liquidating. CRV Is Firm, Up 60% In The Last 3 Months While the founder&#8217;s sale of CRV could put downward pressure, the token remains firm and is up roughly 60% from September 2023 lows. The token trades above $0.60 at spot rates, rejecting selling pressure as the daily chart shows. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target If bulls press on, it could break above $0.72 to record new 2023 highs. The token is trending higher, rejecting bear attempts amid improving sentiment across the crypto scene. Although Erogov is selling CRV, the market seems to interpret the move as bullish. The spectacular revival of CRV is net bullish for the protocol, suggesting that investors are still confident despite headwinds in early H2 2023 when several Curve pools were exploited due to a Vyper compiler issue. Curve Founder Sold CRV To Prevent Liquidation Of DeFi Loans Following the hack in late July 2023, Erogov was forced to liquidate a large chunk to prevent liquidation. On its part, the hack led to over $52 million in crypto assets, including 7.19 million worth of CRV, lost. In the aftermath of the hack, prices crashed. At the time of this hack, Erogov had over $100 million in DeFi loans backed by 427.5 million CRV as collateral. As CRV prices fell, the health of Egorov&#8217;s loans fell in tandem.  If the value of Egorov&#8217;s CRV collateral were to fall further, it could face liquidation. This meant that all protocols from where the founder had borrowed using CRV as collateral would have been forced to sell the token at spot rates to repay the loan. As an automated intervention, the event would have likely caused a cascade, even impacting ordinary holders using CRV as collateral.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $130,000, Here’s When To avoid this and as a form of intervention, Tron founder Justin Sun and multiple other parties, including Jeffrey Huang, made deals to buy CRV from the Curve founder, preventing this liquidation from happening.  According to DeBank on December 27, Erogov&#8217;s crypto portfolio was north of $136 million. Out of this, the founder owns over $38.9 million of CRV. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/binance-coin/binance-coin-bnb-blazes-ahead-predictions-point-to-new-all-time-highs-in-first-half-of-2024/",
    "description": "Binance Coin (BNB), despite experiencing a significant decline earlier this year due to market volatility and the SEC lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has shown remarkable recovery and promising prospects.  Recent data indicates a resurgence in the BNB price, driven by the growing usage of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  Additionally, BNB&#8217;s fundamentals, including impressive market cap figures and increased revenue, further contribute to the positive momentum.  BNB Price Rally Fueled By DApp Adoption?  After witnessing a sharp decline from its yearly high of $350, BNB experienced a drop to the $203 level following the SEC lawsuit against Binance and CZ. However, recent price movements show signs of recovery and bullish sentiment.  Over the past 24 hours, BNB has gained 4.5%, and its performance in the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day time frames demonstrates an upward trend, with gains of 20%, 24%, and 38%, respectively. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why One of the driving factors behind BNB&#8217;s price rally is the increasing use of DApps on the Binance Smart Chain. Data from DappRadar reveals a surge in DApp volume, currently at $4.83 billion, representing a 12% increase.  The BNB chain boasts an ecosystem of 5,120 DApps and has recorded 4.89 million transactions, reflecting a 12.73% surge in the past seven days. These figures indicate a growing demand for BNB as it serves as the primary token within the BSC ecosystem. Comparing BNB to Ethereum (ETH), DappRadar data highlights BNB&#8217;s superior performance in various indicators such as contracts, total unique active wallets (UAW), decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), and non-fungible token (NFT) volume.  The BNB chain has held the top position over the past 24 hours, showcasing its usage and adoption. This outperformance contributes to the positive market sentiment surrounding BNB and bolsters its price. Binance Coin Market Cap Surges To $48 Billion Further boosting the Binance Coin prospects, Token Terminal data reveals impressive market cap figures for BNB, with a circulating market cap of $48.02 billion, marking a 14.18% increase.  Additionally, BNB&#8217;s fully diluted market cap stands at the same value, reflecting a 28.32% growth. The revenue generated by BNB in the past 30 days has increased by 28.51%, reaching $1.47 million.  Furthermore, BNB has recorded significant fee growth, with a 27.98% fee increase over the past 30 days and an annualized revenue of $187.56 million. These fundamentals contribute to the positive sentiment surrounding BNB. Overall, Binance Coin has staged a strong recovery, demonstrating a notable price rally driven by the increasing usage of DApps on the Binance Smart Chain. However, there is a bold prediction by a crypto analyst that could further boost the sentiment and excitement surrounding the token. Binance Coin To Reach New Yearly High?  According to Captain Faibik, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Binance Coin is poised to achieve a new yearly high in the first half of 2024.  This prediction is based on an analysis of BNB&#8217;s 1-week chart, revealing a breakout from a descending triangle pattern, signaling the end of the macro downtrend and initiating a new uptrend phase for BNB. Looking at the chart below, Faibik suggests that BNB&#8217;s price could potentially experience an impressive uptrend of 171% in the initial weeks of 2024. This surge would propel the token&#8217;s price above the current all-time high (ATH) of $686.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Explode 58,000% To $352 However, several resistance levels must be overcome for this projection to materialize. Notably, at the current trading price of $307, BNB faces a significant seven-month resistance barrier, which currently hinders its ascent to the $314 level, the next resistance level in the near term.  Analyzing the 1-day chart, it becomes evident that reaching the all-time high level would require surpassing additional macro resistance levels, including $329, $402, $450, $563, $607, $639, and $653. While the theory proposed by Faibik holds promise, the actual realization of Binance Coin&#8217;s new yearly high in the early months of 2024, along with a sustained uptrend, remains to be observed.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "description": "As the crypto industry marches into 2024, Ethereum draws significant attention from analysts and investors alike. Amidst the swirling currents of the crypto market, Ethereum stands at the cusp of what some analysts are predicting to be a &#8216;transformative period.&#8217; This anticipation stems from two crucial developments: an impending network upgrade and the potential approval of Ethereum-based spot ETFs, according to renowned analyst CryptosRUs. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts Surge To Near $4,000 Levels By Early 2024 Catalysts For Growth: Upgrades And Spot ETF Approval The Ethereum network is gearing up for its next major upgrade, slated for January 2024. This upgrade, known in the crypto community as the Dencun Upgrade, is expected to usher in a range of enhancements to boost network efficiency. Key among these improvements are features designed to shrink transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. This move could significantly ease congestion issues that have long been a concern for users and developers. Additionally, modifications to smart contract operations and enhancements to staking protocols are on the cards, setting the stage for an optimized Ethereum ecosystem. According to CryptosRUs, the anticipated Dencun Upgrade is not the only factor fueling optimism for Ethereum&#8217;s growth in 2024. The analyst has further highlighted the potential impact of approving a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum. Such a development could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum, potentially driving widespread adoption and significant price appreciation.  The analyst points out that approving an Ethereum spot ETF could mirror the influence seen in other markets, substantially boosting investor confidence and market liquidity. Over the past few weeks, we have seen rotations of capital through several crypto ecosystems, including #CosmosEcosystem , #Solana, #Injective, #BRC20s, and #Avalanche. In today&#8217;s #analysis, I am going to explain why I believe Ethereum will be the next ecosystem to see explosive… pic.twitter.com/XdFxqzkbUP — CryptosRUs Analysis (@CRUAnalysis) December 26, 2023 Regulatory Hurdles And Ethereum Growth Trajectory So far, the path to a spot ETF approval appears to be intertwined with regulatory processes. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been extending its timeline for decision-making on both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. With numerous applications pending, the crypto market awaits the SEC&#8217;s verdict, which is anticipated to arrive in 2024. The SEC noted in a recent filing: The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and issues raised therein. Meanwhile, Ethereum&#8217;s performance continues to exhibit resilience and growth. Over the past year, Ethereum&#8217;s value has increased by 88.2%, with a continued upward trajectory evident in recent trading periods. At the time of writing, ETH has experienced a 5.3% surge in the last 24 hours, trading at $2,346. Furthermore, CryptosRUs analysis also extends to ETH, which has shown price movements analogous to Solana&#8217;s (SOL) recent surge. SOL&#8217;s value has soared by over 100% in the past month, leading the analyst to draw parallels with Ethereum&#8217;s potential price trajectory.
