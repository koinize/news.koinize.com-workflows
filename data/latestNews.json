The progress, however, is still far behind where it was last year in this period.</p><p>According to an unaudited report posted on its investor relations page, Canaan's net loss was at $84.4 million in Q1, lower than its $91.6 million net loss in the previous quarter. The net loss represents a major reversal compared to the same period of 2022, when the firm reported a net income of $65.1 million. </p><p>Diluted net loss per American depositary share (ADS) in the first quarter of 2023 was $0.51 from $0.55 in the previous quarter, while diluted net earnings per ADS in the same period of 2022 stood at $0.38.<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ads.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> According</a> to Investopedia, an American depositary share, or ADS, is an equity share in a non-U.S. company, held by a U.S. depositary bank and available for purchase by investors.</p><p>The company claims to be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-canaan-scales-operations-despite-low-earnings-ceo-says\">expanding operations despite the ongoing bear market</a> and associated drop in earnings. </p><p>The quarterly results were impacted by several factors, including low market demand that hindered product revenue, the ongoing crisis in the banking system, and the slow recovery of Bitcoin's (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) price. Revenue in Q1 totaled $55.1 million, against $58.3 million last quarter, and $201.8 million in the same period of 2022. </p><p>\"In the first quarter of 2023, we experienced a further contraction in our sales revenue, due to the industry-wide reduction in selling prices, and unforeseen delays in payment and shipment following a series of U.S. bank failures.

Income generated from mining activities rose 3.3% from $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and represents a 130.2% increase from $4.8 million during the same period of 2022. </p><p>Costs linked to mining operations include electricity and hosting, as well as equipment depreciation and amortization.</p><p>The total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $38.1 million, compared to $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and nearly equal to the same period last year, when it also stood at $38 million. \"We managed to narrow our operating loss by 31.4% from the last quarter,\" noted Cheng. </p><p>The report shows a decrease in investment in research and development. Canaan spent $19.1 million in the first quarter, compared to $33.4 million in the previous period. The decline was due to one-off US$14.3 million research and development expenditures for the A13 series products. In the same period of 2022, the company committed $15.1 million in R&amp;D. </p><p>Cryptocurrency assets held by Canaan as of March 31, 2023, totaled 623 BTC, worth $13.4 million, according to the report.
