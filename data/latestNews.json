    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-2024-forecast-analyst-predicts-surge/",
    "description": "Kevin Svenson, a prominent crypto analyst, has recently shared his 2024 price forecast for Bitcoin, providing a nuanced view of the expected trends in the coming months. Svenson&#8217;s analysis, which breaks down the year into distinct phases, offers a glimpse into the possible highs and lows that Bitcoin might experience. His predictions paint a picture of a year marked by significant volatility, a characteristic trait of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Will Skyrocket To $280,000 Next Year: Hedge Fund Manager Analyst Projected Bitcoin Phases In 2024 Svenson&#8217;s forecast is split into four key phases: a rally leading up to the BTC halving event, a subsequent downturn in Q2, a recovery in Q3, and a potential all-time high (ATH) before the year&#8217;s end. This phased approach underscores the cyclical nature of BTC&#8217;s price movements, heavily influenced by its halving events. Notably, the Bitcoin halving, a process that reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, effectively diminishing the new supply of Bitcoin, has historically been a key driver for price increases. The upcoming BTC halving, projected by Svenson to occur later this year by April 15, 2024, is expected to be a significant catalyst for price movements. According to the analyst&#8217;s chart, BTC could witness a rally, pushing its price to around $60,000 before the halving event, followed by a pullback below the $47,500 region. This pattern aligns with historical trends observed around previous Bitcoin halvings, where supply reduction typically leads to price increases, followed by corrections. After the Q2 dip, Svenson anticipates a recovery phase in Q3, where Bitcoin is expected to regain its lost ground and potentially set a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of 2024. #Bitcoin &#124; Halving Price Action Forecast ▪ Pump into Halving ▪ Dump into Q2 ▪ Pump into Q3 ▪ ATH before EOY Things to keep in mind: 1.) Markets take time. 2.) Volatility is the name of the game. pic.twitter.com/5SgaFK2IHb — Kevin Svenson (@KevinSvenson_) February 5, 2024 BTC Current Trend And Potential Surge Meanwhile, Bitcoin has fallen below the recently traded $43,000 mark. Though the asset is up 6.4% over the past two weeks, it has declined nearly 1% in the past day. BTC&#8217;s daily trading volume, on the other hand, has jumped from below $10 billion to over $15 billion in the last few days.

Michaël van de Poppe, who heads MN Trading, anticipates a period of consolidation for Bitcoin in the forthcoming months. He suggests that the crypto&#8217;s value might oscillate between $ 48,000 and $50,000 as the halving event approaches. My general theory is that #Bitcoin is consolidating in the coming months. Pre-Halving a final run towards resistance at $48-50K, after that another correction to $36-38K and from there #Altcoins to continue outperforming Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/sYiqpg3T93 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 3, 2024 Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"
