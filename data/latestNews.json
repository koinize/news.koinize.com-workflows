Was it a discount or a disaster? </p>\n                    <p><p>In the latest episode of <em>The Market Report</em>, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman delves into Bitcoin’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) latest <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-25-k-opportunity-or-sign-of-calamity\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-25-k-opportunity-or-sign-of-calamity/amp\">bounce at $25,000</a>, which some analysts and influencers argue represents a short-term buying opportunity. Pechman explains that Bitcoin’s inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index has only held for 40% of the previous 20 months, meaning it is likely not a good metric to anticipate price movements.</p><p>The show then shifts focus to a recent Glassnode report revealing that the amount of BTC changing hands is at its lowest since October 2020, citing investors’ “apathy” and “exhaustion.” Pechman argues that bulls got tired after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s relentless action to pursue Coinbase and Binance. Ultimately, Pechman disagrees that Bitcoin’s recent movement to $25,000 presents an opportunity for buyers, given that the short-term risk-reward ratio near the current price level is around 50:50.</p><p>For the show’s next segment, Pechman analyzes the prediction made by Davis Hui, vice president of Bitcoin miner Canaan, that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-hit-100k-in-2024-canaan-vp\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-hit-100k-in-2024-canaan-vp/amp\">BTC will hit $100,000 in 2024</a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-hit-100k-in-2024-canaan-vp\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-hit-100k-in-2024-canaan-vp/amp\"></a> based on the halving and a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. First, Pechman explains that BlackRock’s $10 trillion in assets is merely a mirage, as 55% is stuck in fixed-income investments and $2.8 trillion is already invested in other ETFs such as commodities, the S&P 500 index, global emerging markets and alternative investments.</p><p>Furthermore, Pechman raises the risk of current holders deciding to flip their positions previously bought at $60,000, $50,000 or even $40,000 if Bitcoin’s price were to shoot up, meaning the offer side is never predictable regardless of miners’ incentives. Lastly, Pechman explains that a spot Bitcoin ETF has been a dream for the past eight years, and nothing has changed to refute the SEC’s reasons for dismissal, namely stablecoin trading volumes and unregulated offshore exchanges.</p><p>Check out the latest episode of The Market Report, available exclusively on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@cointelegraphmarketresearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel</a>.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-at-25k-discount-or-disaster&utm_source=cointelegraph_com&utm_medium=appendix&utm_campaign=articles\" data-amp=\"https://mint-cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-at-25k-discount-or-disaster&utm_source=cointelegraph_com&utm_medium=appendix&utm_campaign=articles/amp\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "description": "On Tuesday, September 12, centralized crypto exchange CoinEx became the latest victim of a hack. At the time of the reports, over $27 million in crypto had already been carted away by the attackers. However, almost 24 hours later, the reports rolling in suggest that the exchange may have lost double the amounts that were originally reported. CoinEx Crypto Losses Rise To $55.5 Million The initial reports for the CoinEx hack showed that the attackers were able to move around $27.8 million from the exchange. But as investigators dig further into the attack, the losses have come up to around $55.5 million in crypto lost so far. Related Reading: Tron’s Justin Sun Mulls Over Making A Move On FTX’s Crypto Stash, Here’s Why According to a breakdown posted by Wu Blockchain, a platform run by Chinese reported Colin Wu, the losses extended into lesser-known tokens as well. The majority of the losses were from assets such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP, with assets on the BSC, Polygon, and Kadena blockchain also running into the millions. The ETH amount drained alone came out to over $18 million, as shown in the breakdown, while over $11 million was stolen in Tron’s TRX token. Other notable transactions include $6 million in XRP, over $6.2 million in BNB, $5.9 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $2.5 million in Solana’s SOL, $1.7 million in Dagger’s XDAG, and $1.12 million in Kadena’s KDA. There was also a little over $440,000 stolen in Bitcoin Cash’s BCH. Over $55.5 million confirmed stolen so far &#124; Source: CoinEx Hacker Balance Sheet At the time of writing, a total of $55,567,468 has been confirmed stolen from the hacking incident from the exchange. The crypto stolen from the crypto exchange was sent to 19 wallet addresses spanning 12 blockchains. Hack Continues To Unravel In the aftermath of what has been the largest centralized crypto exchange hack in 2023, CoinEx has promised to compensate all of its affected users in full. The statement which came a couple of hours after the incident was identified told users: You have our solemn promise that a detailed timeline and comprehensive report about this incident will be shared with the community as swiftly as possible.

However, the exchange said in its statement that this was only a temporary measure and that these activities “will resume after a thorough review.” Over the day, the exchange has also taken to posting the wallet addresses it has identified to be linked to the attack. This is being done in an effort to raise awareness about their activities. “We urge affected projects and fellow industry colleagues to assist in flagging and freezing these questionable addresses,” CoinEx said in an X post.
