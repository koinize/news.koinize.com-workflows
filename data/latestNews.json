The BIS wrote:</p><blockquote>\"Recent examples of smart contract hacks, which have led to the loss of a significant amount of value in DeFi, serve as an example of the potential security risks CBDC systems could face.\"</blockquote><p>In its report, the BIS said security frameworks should safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CBDC transactions. By design, CBDCs must be able to dynamically scale to respond to a sudden surge in transaction volumes, have no single points of failure, operate 24/7 without outages, and function even if their underlying financial institution experiences an outage. Moreover:</p><blockquote>\"To organise the control objectives that have been identified and adapted for CBDC systems. This framework therefore has seven steps: Prepare, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover and Adapt.\"</blockquote><p>Together, the seven procedures translate into 104 control objectives such as \"24/7 monitoring and alerting function,\" doing due diligence \"on the security of cryptographic keys,\" and \"using a DDoS protection service\" to alleviate network traffic volume. To execute the framework, BIS called for the establishment of a central bank senior leadership and board, a chief security officer, and various IT, security, and stakeholder teams.</p><p>Although cautious about decentralized finance, BIS has been adamantly supporting the adoption of CBDCs. On June 20, the financial organization published a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bis-releases-unified-ledger-proposal-cross-border-tokenized-asset-transactions\">unified-ledger proposal</a> for cross-border and tokenized asset transactions.
