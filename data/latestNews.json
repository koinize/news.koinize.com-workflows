    "description": "<p>Identity and financial public network, Worldcoin has revealed plans to allow companies and governments everywhere to use its ID system.&nbsp;</p>\nWorldcoin Growing Worldwide\n<p>According to Ricardo Macieira, the general manager for Europe at Tools For Humanity (the San Francisco and Berlin-based company behind Worldcoin), the company will allow more users worldwide to sign up for its ID system. The company requires users to provide iris scans to obtain a digital ID and, in some regions, receive free cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It will also allow other organizations and governments worldwide to use its iris-scanning and identity-verifying technology. With a recent funding round that raised $115 million from venture capital investors like Blockchain Capital, a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global, Worldcoin plans to continue its expansion into Europe, Latin America, Africa, and other receptive regions.</p>\nEnabling Third-Party Use\n<p>In the future, Worldcoin intends to open-source the technology behind its iris-scanning orb, allowing others to benefit. Companies could pay to use Worldcoin's digital identity system, enabling secure and privacy-conscious applications.</p>\n<p>This technology's various potential use cases highlight the need for a global identity and financial public network. Worldcoin's website outlines potential applications for its technology, such as distinguishing between humans and artificial intelligence, facilitating global democratic processes, and paving a path toward universal basic income. However, the realization of these outcomes is not guaranteed.</p>\nPrivacy Concerns\n<p>Despite Worldcoin's claims of being \"completely private,\" regulators and privacy advocates remain concerned about the data collection practices. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision initiated an investigation in November 2022 due to concerns about the large-scale processing of sensitive data. French regulator CNIL is also investigating Worldcoin. Furthermore, it has been suspended by the Kenyan government, citing privacy and security concerns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite concerns from privacy campaigners, Worldcoin claims that 2.2 million users have signed up, with data watchdogs in Britain, France, and Germany investigating the project.</p>\nWorldcoin Commits To Privacy Compliance\n<p>The Worldcoin Foundation, based in the Cayman Islands, asserts its compliance with all laws governing personal data and pledges cooperation with regulatory bodies to address privacy and data protection concerns.</p>\n<p>Worldcoin's future remains uncertain as it navigates regulatory scrutiny and addresses privacy concerns. However, with its ambitious expansion plans and potential applications, the company continues to be a notable player in the evolving landscape of digital identity and cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently captured attention due to its price&#8217;s downward trajectory. While the current decline in DOGE&#8217;s price might raise concerns, astute traders are discerning a potential opportunity amidst the turmoil.  As reported by CoinGecko, the DOGE price stands at $0.074288, reflecting a 3.6% drop in the past 24 hours and a 5.2% decline over the past seven days. These figures emphasize the coin&#8217;s recent volatility and the challenges that DOGE holders and traders face.  Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Off With 23% Burst – What’s Fueling The Thrust? However, beneath the surface of these numbers lies an intriguing pattern that might hold the key to future price action. Source: Coingecko Dogecoin Potential For Bullish Continuation Despite the recent price woes, technical analysis unveils a fascinating pattern on DOGE&#8217;s four-hour time frame chart &#8211; the bullish flag pattern. This pattern, often observed as a continuation signal, consists of a sharp downward slide resembling a flagpole and a consolidation phase marked by parallel trendlines.  In DOGE&#8217;s case, this pattern is at play, suggesting that the ongoing price decline is a precursor to a bullish resurgence. According to a recent report, the battle between support and resistance levels is evident. DOGE&#8217;s price movements within the channel structure reflect this struggle vividly. The support trendline has demonstrated its strength with three discernible bounces, underscoring its importance as a potential rebound point.  DOGE market cap reached $10.25 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Conversely, the overhead resistance has twice thwarted upward price movements, showcasing its influence over trader decisions. These dynamics highlight these levels&#8217; pivotal role in determining potential trend shifts. Historically, flag patterns indicate a temporary pause following a notable price movement, often paving the way for continuing the prior trend. If DOGE&#8217;s buyers successfully breach the resistance barrier, an estimated 8% price surge could enable the coin to break through the psychological barrier at $0.085. Divergent Perspectives Amid the optimism surrounding the flag pattern, caution is unveiled in a separate report. The report’s viewpoint suggests a bearish outlook for DOGE, grounded in the coin&#8217;s struggles to overcome the resistance of a falling wedge pattern. $DOGE has performed its new Weekly Close below the pattern resistance As a result, #DOGE is potentially set up for a rejection and intra-pattern consolidation Worst case scenario, DOGE could retrace to the very bottom of the market structure#Crypto #Dogecoin https://t.co/K8KUgizgNw pic.twitter.com/sVbLgHlNzd — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 31, 2023 DOGE might experience a retracement in a more pessimistic scenario, descending to the wedge&#8217;s diagonal support at around $0.055. This divergence in opinions underscores the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Price Gears Up For A 10% Upswing – Here’s How While the downward trajectory of DOGE&#8217;s price might trigger concern, it also beckons an opportunity for those who analyze its underlying patterns. The emergence of the flag pattern amidst the price decline hints at the potential for a bullish continuation. Yet, analysts&#8217; differing perspectives serve as a reminder of the intricate nature of cryptocurrency markets.  (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.
