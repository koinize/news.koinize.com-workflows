    "description": "The global cryptocurrency market value has retraced to over $1.72 trillion, suggesting that the cryptocurrency industry has lost some of its momentum in the last day.¬†Furthermore, MATIC has not seen any tiny losses, in contrast to the majority of prominent digital assets, such as Bitcoin. As the Polygon protocol&#8217;s supporters push for new yearly highs, MATIC is experiencing a seismic change within its ecosystem, which has caused its price to soar by more than 20% in early trading on Thursday. Related Reading: Axie Infinity Springs Back To Life With Surprise 35% Rally ‚Äì Details MATIC Breaches $1 Barrier Based on the several milestones in its ecosystem, Polygon has been indicating that it is prepared to overcome the critical $0.9 pricing threshold. Following an initial upward trend, MATIC made an unsuccessful attempt to break out in February 2023. Before the price broke out this week, there were two more failed breakout efforts in November and December. The $1.07 peak on Wednesday is the highest since April. It is noteworthy that MATIC has failed to close each week above the resistance trend line. Furthermore, some analysts say that MATIC may soon reach new peaks as it tries to keep a solid footing within &#8211; or even past &#8211; the $1 territory. Doctor Profit, a user on Twitter, is among those who endorse such theory. $MATIC is one of the most undervalued projects out there.

Chart: TradingView.com Another expert, renowned cryptocurrency researcher Ali Martinez, shows that, based on his evaluation, MATIC is emerging from a symmetrical triangular formation. Martinez thinks that a strong upward advance that might push MATIC towards the $1.73 price level could occur if Polygon is able to maintain a weekly candlestick close above the $0.96 threshold. #Polygon is on the verge of a breakout from a symmetrical triangle.
