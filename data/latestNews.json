    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-poised-for-bullish-breakout-30-rally-predicted/",
    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts and holders have had a glimmer of optimism to hold on to, as the meme token is currently posting gains of about 4.35% in the past seven days amidst inflows into the crypto market. This recent price action prompted an analysis from crypto analyst Captain Faibik, who predicts a 30% surge for DOGE.  Related Reading: These Dogecoin Whale Transaction Stats Spell Trouble Despite Ongoing Crypto Rally According to the analyst, the price of DOGE is on the verge of breaking out of a symmetrical triangle, putting the crypto back on track to climbing above the $0.1 price level again. Technical Analysis Points To Impending DOGE Breakout Captain Faibik recently took to social media platform X to share a bullish prediction on DOGE. According to the 12-hour timeframe price chart shared by the analyst, the price of Dogecoin has been forming a downward-sloping triangle since it reached $0.1018 on December 12. Notably, price action illustrates a sequence of lower highs and higher lows between the trendlines, which shows that bears are gradually losing control of the market.  Lower highs and higher lows are generally considered bullish, as they typically indicate a consolidation phase before a potential trend reversal to the upside. Faibik&#8217;s technical analysis indicates a likely 30% bullish breakout above $0.08199. If this turns out to be correct, a prolonged breakout might result in Dogecoin revisiting its December high around the $0.106 level by March. $DOGE is on the Verge of Symmetrical Triangle Breakout..!! In Case of Upside Breakout, Expecting +30% Bullish Rally in the Short term. 📈#Crypto #DOGE #Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/j1WL8mv33u — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) February 13, 2024  Can DOGE Reenter The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies? Recent market dynamics have resulted in Dogecoin losing its place among the 10 biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Chainlink (LINK), the culprit, was able to displace Dogecoin from the 10th position after two weeks of intense price gain. During this period, Dogecoin also witnessed a crash in whale transactions, implying waning sentiment from these large holders. However, Chainlink&#8217;s rally seems to have slowed, with the crypto currently on a 4% correction from $20.82. Consequently, data from Coinmarketcap shows Chainlink is yet to gain a substantial distance ahead of Dogecoin in terms of market cap.  Chainlink is currently only ahead by $80.8 million, giving Dogecoin a chance to catch up. The 30% bullish breakout prediction above the current price level is enough to push Dogecoin back into the top 10 crypto assets. While another major DOGE rally isn’t guaranteed, technical factors are lining up. The first resistance is at $0.083, and a decisive breakout above this level could give traders an entry opportunity. However, failing to break above this resistance level would invalidate a bullish run, and DOGE could fall back to $0.078.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 5% After Elon Musk Gets Called Back For Twitter Probe At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.0818, down by 0.61% in the past 24 hours.
