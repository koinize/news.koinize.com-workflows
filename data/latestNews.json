The event will effectively reduce Litecoin network's mining reward per block from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC and theoretically reduce the amount of new supply. </p><p>For instance, independent market analyst Crypto Tony <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1674739305498161152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">believes</a> Litecoin can rally toward $140 ahead of the halving.

Suppose it happens. Then LTC price could return to $100 as a test of this key support level. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/16fb9b72-c3f0-4a92-a7c8-ab2c5fa42672.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USD daily price chart.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/four-layer-architecture-proposed-for-polygon-2-0",
    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Crypto infrastructure developer Polygon Labs has proposed a new, four-layered architectural design for its upcoming \"Polygon 2.0\" project.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The announcement, made on June 29, offers a detailed look at the planned infrastructure, which comprises four unique \"layers\" working in tandem to secure and scale networks built on the protocol. With a bridge aggregator set to make transactions &ldquo;near-instant and atomic,&rdquo; Polygon 2.0 is poised to dramatically reshape the crypto industry.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Polygon 2.0: A Four-Layered Approach</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The new proposal outlines the foundation of the project, the &ldquo;staking layer,&rdquo; which is currently in existence. This layer comprises a \"validator manager\" contract on Ethereum, along with an additional \"chain manager\" contract for each Polygon chain. Future Polygon chains will be able to form by launching new chain manager contracts on Ethereum.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Built on top of this staking layer will be an \"interoperability layer,\" providing bridges to connect each Polygon chain via Ethereum. This layer will also feature an aggregator that combines individual zero-knowledge proofs from each bridge into one proof before sending it to Ethereum, enabling &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; bridge transactions and &ldquo;dramatically reducing Ethereum gas consumption for proof verification,&rdquo; according to the team.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Polygon Labs elaborates in its announcement:</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">\"We believe this proposal can and should direct all Polygon protocol development efforts moving forward, serving both as the conceptual North Star and the formal development framework.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The two remaining layers of Polygon 2.0 will include the current execution layer, which relies upon the Erigon Ethereum client, and a \"proving layer\" that will standardize the zero-knowledge-proof process across all Polygon chains.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">A Future-Proof Infrastructure</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Polygon isn't the only network attempting to transform into a multi-chain ecosystem. Other developers like zkSync Era and Optimism are working on similar strategies, but Polygon 2.0's unique four-layered approach sets it apart.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">In a statement, the team promises more information on each layer in the future, stating:</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">\"Polygon 2.0 consists of four protocol layers, each enabling an important process within the network: Staking Layer, Interop Layer, Execution Layer, Proving Layer.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">With the proposal now public, the network&rsquo;s validators will need to approve it. Polygon 2.0's vision, as expressed by the development team, is to establish &ldquo;the value layer&rdquo; of the internet, promising a more secure and scalable network.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Just as the internet is an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing information, Polygon 2.0 seeks to serve as an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing value.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Parallels With Early Internet Innovations</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">With a vision of enabling an \"Internet of Blockchains\", Polygon 2.0's strategic design could revolutionize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology. Polygon Labs&rsquo; commitment to enhancing the tech stack and protocol layers supports the global shift towards decentralized systems, heralding a new era in digital innovation and resource management.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The suggested architecture of Polygon 2.0 is reminiscent of the Internet protocol suite, a modular, flexible, and efficient framework that has become the backbone of our global digital ecosystem. Each layer in the proposed Polygon 2.0 is designed to facilitate a specific sub-process, streamlining the protocol implementation, updates, and potentially transforming the way we interact with the blockchain.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">In the broader context of the blockchain space, this development reflects the industry's collective pursuit of scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. As an increasing number of organizations turn to blockchain solutions for various applications, the necessity for adaptable, scalable, and unified frameworks becomes even more apparent. In providing such an architecture, Polygon 2.0 could significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem's growth and the wider acceptance of decentralized solutions.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
