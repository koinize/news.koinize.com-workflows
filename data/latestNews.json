According to court filings, Prime Trust <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nevada-financial-regulator-petitions-court-prime-trust-receivership\">agreed to the petition</a> for receivership with the Financial Institutions Division based on the “substantial deficit between its assets and liabilities.”</p><p>At the time, the Nevada financial regulator called for the immediate appointment of a receiver due to the risk of “irreparable harm” to users, the public and “confidence in the emerging market of cryptocurrency.” The Financial Institutions Division <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/prime-trust-financial-condition-deteriorated-nevada-regulator\">said Prime Trust</a> was “unable to honor customer withdrawals” as part of a June 21 cease-and-desist order.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trueusd-assures-users-no-prime-trust-exposure\"><strong><em>TrueUSD assures users it has no exposure to troubled Prime Trust</em></strong></a></p><p>According to the June 26 petition, Prime Trust owed more than $85 million in fiat and $69.5 million in crypto to its clients.
