Logan Paul has not paid back his victims, he hasn’t talked about it since he first announced he was gonna pay them back. And what’s worst of all, he doesn’t seem to have a plan in place to refund anyone.”</blockquote><p>“How do I know that? Well because I've been asking Logan for that plan to refund people, the entire time, behind the scenes,” he added. </p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYYiypp6WaY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>CryptoZoo was launched in September 2021, intending to be a NFT breeding game offering opportunities to earn ZOO tokens and NFTs, with Paul himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqrH7TbruZA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">describing</a> it as a “really fun game that makes you money.” </p><p>However, with lackluster NFT artwork that was seemingly ripped from Adobe Stock images, tanking NFT and ZOO token prices and an apparent failure to deliver on the roadmap, investors became disgruntled by late 2022. </p><p>After facing<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-backflips-on-defamation-lawsuit-against-coffeezilla-apologizes\"> strong backlash from the community</a> following Coffezilla’s series of expose videos on CryptoZoo, Paul ultimately <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-unveils-1-3m-cryptozoo-recovery-plan\">announced a plan to refund investors</a> on January 14, while also vowing to deliver on the project’s roadmap. </p><p>This however, didn’t stop CryptoZoo and Paul from being <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-and-cryptozoo-sued-in-class-action-lawsuit\">slapped with a class action</a> lawsuit the following month. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My 3-step plan for CryptoZoo, including a $1.3M rewards program for disappointed players.<br><br>Thank you, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@coffeebreak_YT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xFX017UHoc\">pic.twitter.com/xFX017UHoc</a></p>&mdash; Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1613961266984255515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In Coffeezilla’s latest video, he shared screenshots of email communications with Paul’s lawyer Jeffrey Neiman of the MNR law firm, which appear to suggest that a concrete plan has yet to be established.</p><p>“We represent Logan Paul.
