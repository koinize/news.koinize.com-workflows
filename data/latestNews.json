Additionally, a second post by Sun made the price of a token surge by 24% in a matter of minutes.

As reported by NewsBTC, TRON significantly surpassed other Layer-1 networks in address growth, including Avalanche and Cardano. This time, TRON is in the headlines after its founder, Justin Sun, shared some news for the ecosystem on X (formerly known as Twitter.) Sun posted on Monday morning to inform the crypto community that a TRON-based inscription marketplace is coming. “Exciting news, the inscription market based on #TRON is about to launch,” said the TRON founder. Inscriptions became popular after the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals last year. The new technology allowed the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the Bitcoin blockchain and has seen different applications ever since. As it can be created using any type of data, like audio, video, and images, other chains started to launch their inscriptions. TRON developers and APENFT Foundation’s NFT team developed the inscriptions marketplace. All developers are welcome to build in the TRON ecosystem, Sun said. TRON’s native token didn’t seem to react to the news. TRX’s price has increased by 0.4% in the last 24 hours. At writing time, the token is trading at $0,1409, representing a mild 2.1% price surge in the 7-day timeframe. TRX is trading at $0,1409 in the hourly chart.

As of this writing, further details about the launch are yet to be revealed. However, the community welcomed the news positively. Many expressed excitement to see what the TRON ecosystem could bring to the NFT market. Similarly, crypto exchange Binance recently revealed its Inscription Marketplace, allowing users to create and trade inscription tokens within the Binance app.s Justin Sun Behind BitTorrent (BTT)’s Price Surge?
