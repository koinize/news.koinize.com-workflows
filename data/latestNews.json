    "description": "Ethereum price settled below the $1,565 support zone against the US dollar. ETH is accelerating lower and might drop toward the $1,440 support. Ethereum is gaining pace below the $1,550 support zone. The price is trading just below $1,565 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,565 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair remains at risk of more downsides toward the $1,440 support. Ethereum Price Turns At Risk Ethereum started a fresh decline and settled below the $1,600 pivot level. ETH traded below the $1,565 and $1,550 support levels, like Bitcoin. A low is formed near $1,542 and the price is now consolidating losses. The current price action suggests high chances of more losses. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,565 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The first major resistance is near the $1,575 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,585 swing high to the $1,542 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $1,575 resistance might start a steady increase. In the stated case, Ether could start a recovery wave toward the $1,600 resistance.
