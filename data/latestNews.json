DALL-E, in contrast to conventional picture creation models, can produce original images in response to given <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-better-results\">text prompts</a>, demonstrating its capacity to comprehend and transform verbal concepts into visual representations.</p><p>During training, DALL-E makes use of a sizable collection of text-image pairs. It learns to associate visual cues with the semantic meaning of text instructions. DALL-E creates an image from a sample of its learned probability distribution of images in response to a text prompt. </p><p>The model creates a visually consistent and contextually relevant image that corresponds with the supplied prompt by fusing the textual input with the latent space representation. As a result, DALL-E is able to produce a wide range of creative pictures from textual descriptions, pushing the limits of generative AI in the area of image synthesis.</p><h2>How does DALL-E work?</h2><p>The generative AI model DALL-E can produce incredibly detailed visuals from verbal descriptions. To attain this capability, it incorporates ideas from both language and image processing. Here is a description of how DALL-E works:</p><h3>Training data</h3><p>A sizable data set made up of pairs of photos and their related text descriptions is used to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/training-vs-testing-data-in-machine-learning\">train</a> DALL-E. The link between visual information and written representation is taught to the model using these image-text pairs.</p><h3>Autoencoder architecture</h3><p>DALL-E is built using an autoencoder architecture, which is made up of two primary parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder receives an image and reduces its dimensions to create a representation called latent space. The decoder then uses this representation of latent space to create an image.</p><h3>Conditioning on text prompts</h3><p>DALL-E adds a conditioning mechanism to the conventional autoencoder architecture. This indicates that DALL-E subjects its decoder to text-based instructions or explanations while creating images. The text prompts have an impact on the appearance and content of the created image.</p><h3>Latent space representation</h3><p>DALL-E learns to map both visual cues and written prompts into a common latent space using the latent space representation technique. The representation of latent space serves as a link between the visual and verbal worlds. DALL-E can create visuals that correspond with the provided textual descriptions by conditioning the decoder on particular text prompts.</p><h3>Sampling from the latent space</h3><p>DALL-E selects points from the learned latent space distribution to produce images from text prompts. The decoder’s starting point is these sampled points. DALL-E produces visuals that correlate to the given text prompts by modifying the sampled points and decoding them.</p><h3>Training and fine-tuning</h3><p>DALL-E goes through a thorough training procedure utilizing cutting-edge optimization methods. The model is taught to precisely recreate the original images and discover the relationships between visual and textual cues. The model’s performance is improved through fine-tuning, which also makes it possible for it to produce a variety of high-quality images based on various text inputs.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/googles-bard-vs-open-ais-chatgpt#:~:text=The%20greatest%20difference%20between%20ChatGPT,monetary%20component%20attached%20to%20it.\">Google’s Bard vs. Open AI’s ChatGPT</a></em></strong></p><h2>Use cases and applications of DALL-E</h2><p>DALL-E has a wide range of fascinating use cases and applications thanks to its exceptional capacity to produce unique, finely detailed visuals based on text inputs. Some notable examples include:</p><ul><li>Creative design and art: DALL-E can help designers and artists come up with concepts and ideas visually. It can produce appropriate visuals from textual descriptions of desired visual elements or styles, inspiring and facilitating the creative process.</li><li>Marketing and advertising: DALL-E can be used to design distinctive visuals for promotional initiatives. Advertisers can provide text descriptions of the desired objects, settings or aesthetics for their brands, and DALL-E can create custom photographs that are consistent with the campaign’s narrative and visual identity.</li><li>Interpretability and control: DALL-E has the capacity to produce visual material for a range of media, including books, periodicals, websites and social media. It can convert text into images that go with it, resulting in aesthetically appealing and interesting multimedia experiences.</li><li>Product prototyping: By creating visual representations based on verbal descriptions, DALL-E can help in the early stages of product design. The ability of designers and engineers to quickly explore many concepts and variations facilitates the prototyping and iteration processes.</li><li>Gaming and virtual worlds: DALL-E’s picture production skills can help with game design and virtual world development. It enables the creation of enormous and immersive virtual environments by producing realistically rendered landscapes, characters, objects and textures.</li><li>Visual aids and accessibility: DALL-E can assist with accessibility initiatives by producing visual representations of text content, such as visualizing textual descriptions for people with visual impairments or developing alternate visual presentations for educational resources.</li><li>Limited understanding of real-world constraints: DALL-E can help in the creation of illustrations or other visual components for the narrative. Authors can provide textual descriptions of objects or people, and DALL-E can produce related images to bolster the narrative and capture the reader’s imagination.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-googles-bard-and-how-does-it-work\">What is Google’s Bard, and how does it work?</a></em></strong></p><h2>ChatGPT vs. DALL-E</h2><p>ChatGPT is a language model designed for conversational tasks, while DALL-E is an image generation model capable of creating unique images from textual descriptions. Here's a comparison table highlighting the differences between ChatGPT and DALL-E:</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/48cc5d45-e939-4c9a-8820-9b8b98e5555e.png\"  /></figure><h2>Limitations of DALL-E</h2><p>DALL-E has constraints to take into account despite its capabilities in producing graphics from text prompts. The model might reinforce prejudices seen in the training data, possibly perpetuating <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ethical-considerations-in-ai-development-and-deployment\">stereotypes or biases within society</a>. Beyond the supplied prompt, it struggles with subtle nuances and abstract explanations because it lacks contextual awareness.</p><p>The complexity of the model can make interpretation and control difficult. DALL-E often creates very distinct visuals, but it could have trouble coming up with other versions or catching all of the potential outcomes. It can take a lot of effort and processing to produce high-quality photographs. </p><p>Additionally, the model might provide absurd but visually appealing results that ignore limitations in the real world. To responsibly manage expectations and ensure the intelligent use of DALL-E’s capabilities, it is imperative to be aware of these restrictions. These restrictions are being addressed in ongoing research in order to enhance generative AI.</p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "<p>With bitcoin gathering strength above $30,000 another strong move to the upside could be on the way.</p>\nA safe haven - but do people know it?\n<p>Having taken all that could be thrown at it by government and financial agencies, bitcoin appears to be doing exactly what it was built for, and that is providing a safe haven for the peoples&rsquo; wealth outside of a fast-crumbling fiat financial system.</p>\n<p>The real shame of the matter is that a lot of the mud that has been frantically slung at the crypto sector by mainstream media on behalf of the banks has undeniably stuck, with the vast majority of people not feeling that they can trust one of the only life rafts available to them.</p>\n<p>However, if bitcoin can continue its current strong trend to the upside the mainstream media will find it increasingly difficult to ignore and will be able to manufacture less reasons to stop the average retail investor from buying it - as long as the SEC hasn&rsquo;t destroyed all the on/off ramps from the banks.</p>\nMomentum about to pick up\n<p>Momentum indicators are starting to go bitcoin&rsquo;s way. The huge pump in price from $24,800 to around $31,400 wasn&rsquo;t something that could be sustained, and bitcoin has had to go downwards and sideways for the last few days in order for the RSIs (momentum indicators) to reset.</p>\n<p>This has happened for both the shorter term 4-hourly and 8-hourly, and the 12 hourly is on the way down. Looking out at the long term weekly timeframe things do look good for bitcoin given that the weekly Stochastic RSI has crossed upwards and has pierced through the 20 level signalling strong upwards momentum.</p>\n<p>Continuing with this more macro outlook, closing a weekly candle above the $30,000 price level was an extremely bullish action for bitcoin. It could certainly be argued that this is the all-important level for it to get above since it has been support and resistance since early 2021.</p>\n<p>Last week&rsquo;s candle was also the first to break out of the weekly Gaussian Channel since it was entered for the first time in July of 2021. Once a bull run starts in earnest the price never goes back inside this channel.</p>\nReducing returns\n<p>Even though many commentators and analysts might be calling for well over $100,000 for this cycle it would be good to look into the reducing highs over time for bitcoin. This would point towards a high of around $100,000, much less than many are predicting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, a 3x from here amid the carnage of bank failures and a collapsing economy is not such a bad return.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "On-chain data shows that XRP traders have been selling at a loss recently, unlike investors of the other top assets. Here&#8217;s why this can be bullish for the coin. XRP Loss Transactions Have Outweighed Profit Ones Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has differed from the rest of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of the loss-taking behavior of the investors. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,&#8221; which, as its name already hints, tells us about how the profit-taking volume of a specific coin compares with the loss-taking volume. This metric separates these two volumes by going through the chain history of each coin being transacted to see what price it was previously moved at. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot value, then that particular coin is now being sold at a profit. Naturally, all such coins will contribute towards the profit-taking volume. On the other hand, the coins of the opposite case will add to the loss-taking volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this ratio for some of the top assets in the sector over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been positive for most of the coins &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the indicator has recently had positive values for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). Whenever the metric has such green values, it means that the profit-taking volume is more than the loss-taking volume currently. This profit-taking spree from the investors of these cryptocurrencies isn&#8217;t unexpected, as the prices of the various assets have observed a significant uplift during the past week. Following such sharp rallies, at least some holders tend to harvest their gains. The odd one out here is XRP, however. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the metric has turned negative for the asset recently, implying that the investors have been participating in a net amount of loss-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Stagnates At ATH, What Does This Mean? The reason behind these holders selling at a loss would be the poor performance of the coin relative to the other top assets, as XRP has in fact registered a decline of 1% during the past week. Usually, loss-taking is a sign that the investors of the asset have started to give up, as they likely believe that the coin would only see a further downtrend in the near future. Such capitulation, however, has historically actually been bullish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price, as weak hands exit the coin during these events, while stronger hands buy up their tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges The deeper the investors capitulate, the more likely a rise in the price becomes. The XRP investors, though, have only been participating in a slight amount of loss-taking recently. But nonetheless, it&#8217;s still a bullish sign for the asset, even if not a particularly major one. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.48, down 1% in the last week. XRP continues to consolidate &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
