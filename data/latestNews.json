Digital assets are so clearly the future of financial services. It is imperative the country keeps pace with our international peers, with a robust regulatory framework,” said Bowler.</p><p>Similarly, Adrian Przelozny, the CEO of Independent Reserve commended the Federal government on its recommendations to introduce stronger regulation and policy change, telling Cointelegraph that these new proposals could help restore trust in the crypto sector.</p><blockquote>“We firmly believe these changes will drive investment, provide certainty to the sector and ultimately, increase consumer protection.”</blockquote><p>The general counsel of Swyftx, Adam Percy, also agreed with much of the Treasury’s proposals, saying the primary focus should be ensuring that crypto investors can safely access the benefits of blockchain technology, while still allowing room for innovation. </p><p>However, Jonathon Miller, the Managing Director of Kraken Australia, told Cointelegraph he was concerned that the new rules would be stuffing the crypto industry into a TradFi-shaped box. </p><p>“Australia is now in the unfortunate situation where our regulation has taken a very long time, so we’re taking the approach of shoehorning crypto into existing financial services regulation,” said Miller. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-crypto-bill-senator-bragg-rejection\"><strong><em>Rejection of crypto bill exposes Aussies to ‘unregulated market’ — Senator Bragg</em></strong></a></p><p>Still, Miller admitted that the consultation paper was a step in the right direction, especially for providing much-needed regulatory certainty for crypto companies operating on Australian soil. </p><p>“We’re behind our global peers when it comes to implementing a crypto framework, so I appreciate the need to have something in place locally to provide certainty to platforms like ours,” he added. </p><p>Liam Hennessy, a partner at Clyde &amp; Co — an international law firm that has been assisting in the consultation process — said that the newest proposal from the Treasury “makes sense” for the Australian crypto industry. </p><p>Hennessy explained that the new rules will help the nation catch up to jurisdictions such as the European Union who are further along in their efforts to better regulate crypto. </p><p>Additionally, he said the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licensing regime can be quite complicated, meaning that local cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset service providers will need to begin preparing their applications now.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/dao-hyped-voting-decentralization/\"><strong><em>Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

Additionally, the consultation paper explained that it will regulate crypto exchanges under pre-existing financial services laws, instead of crafting new crypto-specific rules.</p><p>The proposed new rules will see any crypto exchange holding more than $3.2 million, or more than $946 per individual, required to obtain a licence from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/70d51a75-66c5-4a5e-97ee-23e910e53176.PNG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto lawyer Aaron Lane said the industry has been pushing for this approach.

If they breakout to the upside, a new up-move may start. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could outperform in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/c6976aa5-5d2b-4ca7-999a-4d9e28eb55db.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

In this case, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,110), the BTC/USDT pair could rise to $28,143. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level. </p><p>Alternatively, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day simple moving average ($26,671), it will signal that bears have asserted their supremacy. The pair may first drop to $25,990 and thereafter to the pivotal support at $24,800. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/da4230ce-92d2-4baf-adc4-f9340e163db4.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The pair’s recovery is facing selling at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are not rushing to the exit and are keeping up the pressure.</p><p>If the 20-EMA is taken out, the pair could first rise to the 50-SMA. This level may act as a minor barrier but if overcome, the pair could climb to $27,750 and then to $28,143.</p><p>On the contrary, if the bulls fail to pierce the 20-EMA, the sellers will sense an opportunity to pull the price lower. A dump below $26,500 could sink the pair to $26,000 and then to $24,800.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day EMA ($21.77). This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip this level into support.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3c85bf81-6eeb-4ef0-a4f6-2d2ef75975e2.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is a minor resistance at $22.50 but if this level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. A break and close above this resistance will complete the bullish setup. Buyers may face a stiff resistance at $27.12 but if this hurdle is cleared, the pair could surge to the target objective at $32.81.</p><p>This positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 50-day SMA ($20.50). That could start a descent toward $18.58 and then to $15.33. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3705e281-988e-4ed0-aa17-fe182ca5bb66.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT 4-hour chart.

This indicates that the bears may remain in control. The pair could first fall to $20.93 and if this level also cracks, the pair may collapse to $20.</p><p>Conversely, if the price fails to sustain below the 20-EMA, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 50-SMA. That could open the doors for a rally to $23.50 and then to the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern.</p><h2>Lido DAO price analysis</h2><p>Lido DAO (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/lido-dao-ldo-price-index\">LDO</a>) has been trading near the moving averages for the past few days, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/34e866f4-737c-4070-a111-04a673114ac4.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LDO/USDT daily chart.

The immediate resistance on the upside is $1.73. If this level is scaled, the LDO/USDT pair could climb to the downtrend line. This level is again likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns down and skids below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are in command and are selling on every minor rally. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.38.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/85b5046c-88dd-46f9-98be-2536cfbd6bf4.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LDO/USDT 4-hour chart.

There is a minor resistance at $1.63 but it is likely to be crossed.

This indicates that the buyers have the upper hand. The pair is likely to reach the overhead resistance at $3.35 where the bears may to pose a strong challenge.</p><p>If the price turns down from $3.35, the consolidation may continue for a while longer.

Buyers will try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will invalidate the negative setup. That could start a new up-move toward $0.021.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears continue to defend the downtrend line with vigor. The bears will then again try to pull the price to the critical support at $0.014.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/2c308523-26a4-4461-ac91-beb4589c06cb.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>VET/USDT 4-hour chart.

Buyers are trying to push and sustain the price above the 50-SMA. If they do that, the VET/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line of the wedge. A break and close above the wedge could start a new up-move.</p><p>The bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will aggressively defend the zone between the 50-SMA and the downtrend line. If the price turns down sharply and slides below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the pair may remain inside the wedge for some more time.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The hook enables users to be checked for Know Your Customer (KYC) before they can trade on a pool.</p><p>Criticizing the hook, a user at X (formerly Twitter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yourfriendSOMMI/status/1713184911698645320\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noted</a> that the hook opens up the possibility of decentralized finance protocols being whitelisted by regulators:</p><blockquote>\"As I explained in all my posts for the past year: It starts with “kyc option” for LPs.

In Uniswap V4, this hook will permit developers to use KYC verification within the decentralized finance protocol. </p><p>Financial institutions use KYC procedures to authenticate customer identities and assess associated risks. A primary goal of KYC is to detect money laundering and terrorist financing activities. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/b72f1ae9-482f-4f33-9a3e-401aa04bb954.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>KYC hook code available on GitHub.

This nanometer measurement pertains to the size of chip features, with smaller values accommodating more features on a chip, consequently enhancing semiconductor performance.</p><p>Canon reportedly announced that its new system, the FPA-1200NZ2C, can produce semiconductors matching a 5nm process and scale down to 2nm, surpassing the capabilities of the A17 Pro chip found in Apple's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which is a 3nm semiconductor.</p><p>The Dutch government has imposed restrictions on ASML, preventing the export of its EUV lithography machines to China, where no units have been shipped. This limitation exists due to the critical role of these machines in the production of cutting-edge semiconductor chips.</p><p>With Canon's assertion that their new machine can facilitate the production of semiconductors equivalent to 2nm, it is likely to face increased scrutiny.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-protect-users-ai-copyright-accusations\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/google-protect-users-ai-copyright-accusations/amp\"><strong><em>Google to protect users in AI copyright accusations</em></strong></a></p><p>Cointelegraph reported earlier that the Biden administration is targeting a loophole that has allowed developers in China to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-tightening-ai-chip-controls-china-third-parties\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/biden-tightening-ai-chip-controls-china-third-parties/amp\">purchase chips from the infamous Huaqiangbei electronics</a> area in Shenzhen, a city in southern China.</p><p>However, China has released draft security regulations for companies providing <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/generative-ai#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20a%20subset,processes%20and%20produce%20unique%20results.\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/generative-ai#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20a%20subset,processes%20and%20produce%20unique%20results./amp\">generative artificial intelligence (AI)</a> services, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-sets-stricter-rules-training-generative-ai-models\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/china-sets-stricter-rules-training-generative-ai-models/amp\">encompassing restrictions on data sources</a> used for AI model training.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-killed-translation-industry-easytranslate-boss-change-human-jobs/\"><strong><em>‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Ethereum price managed to recover from the $1,520 level against the US dollar. ETH is now facing hurdles near the $1,565 and $1,600 resistance levels. Ethereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,550 level. The price is trading just above $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline unless there is a clear move above $1,565 and $1,600. Ethereum Price Starts Minor Recovery Ethereum managed to stay above the $1,500 and $1,520 levels. ETH formed a short-term support base and recently started a fresh increase from the $1,520 zone, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $1,550 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading just above $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bears seem to be preventing an upside break above the $1,565 resistance. If there is a clear move above the $1,565 resistance, Ether could rise toward the next major hurdle at $1,600. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. A close above the $1,600 resistance might start a decent increase. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750. Another Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,565 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

    "description": "Ethereum has been in a descending channel against Bitcoin since August of last year, meaning Bitcoin has been the better investment over this time. However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts Ethereum Price Action Ethereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period. This is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn&#8217;t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it&#8217;s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion. During bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns. Ethereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin When comparing ETH&#8217;s value to BTC, it&#8217;s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market. &#160; ETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView The chart above highlights three other distinct phases: Accumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum Ascending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows. Distribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions. The accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action in October: A Probabilistic Overview Last Cycle Reflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle. Yet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it&#8217;s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH&#8217;s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation. Final thoughts While an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.

    "description": "ApeCoin (APE) will undergo a token unlock valued at $16.69 million. This development comes amidst the token’s bearish price action, which has led to it losing half its market value in Q3 2023.  Related Reading: Apecoin Weakens Grip In Last 30 Days – Should Investors Get Worried? 15.60 Million ApeCoin (APE) Set To Flood The Market Next Week According to data from TokenUnlocks, ApeCoin’s next token unlock is set to occur on October 17, during which the ApeCoin DAO will release 15.60 million new APE tokens into circulation.  This will mark the tenth APE token unlock in 2023, as this event occurs on the seventeenth day of every month. Based on more information from TokenUnlocks, the newly released APE coins will be allocated to five major parties.  These include Yuga Labs and its founder, the ApeCoin DAO Treasury, charity, and the project’s launch contributors, i.e., early investors in the token before its official launch. Upon release, tokens are expected to form 4.23% of APE’s circulating supply. ApeCoin was launched in March 2022, with a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, of which 54.25% are currently unlocked. However, only 367.59 million APE are part of the token’s circulating supply. APE’s Bearish Form To Continue? Generally, token unlocks are usually accompanied by concerns of an incoming downward trend. This is because the sudden availability of large amounts of tokens may prompt some investors to sell and take profit, which puts downward pressure on the said token’s price. As earlier stated, APE already finds itself stuck in a long bearish market. Although the token is only down by 2.79% in the last month, its overall performance in 2023 has been largely negative. Related Reading: Apecoin Weakens Grip In Last 30 Days – Should Investors Get Worried? According to data from CoinMarketCap, APE has lost 70% of its value in 2023 compared to its market price as of January 1.  APE could soon record more losses with the token unlock set for next week. However, that may not be the case. Based on historical data, token unlocks do not always result in a price loss, as notably seen with Aptos in January, in which the APT gained by 50% following its monthly token release.  Moreover, there have been some interesting developments surrounding ApeCoin in the last week. On October 11, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Narwal proposed on the ApeCoin DAO the development of an exclusive layer 2 solution for ApeCoin, known as “ApeChain.” Currently, APE is based on the Ethereum Network, and it functions as the governance asset of the APE ecosystem, which consists of NFT projects launched by Yuga Labs, such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).  However, creating ApeChain could enable Apecoin to achieve a higher level of scalability, which, in turn, could positively affect its adoption and market price. APE trades at $1.06 when writing, with a 1.47% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily volume is down by 16.96%, valued at $19.32 million.

    "description": "As earlier reported, Bitcoin holders have steadily held on to their coins in the past few months. Bitcoin whales, in particular, seem to be doubling despite the current uncertainty in Bitcoin&#8217;s future projection. Long-term holders add an average of 50,000 BTC to their wallets every month, as indicated by the HODLer Net Position Change indicator provided by Glassnode.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Bitcoin To Surpass Gold And Silver Within A Decade On the other hand, whales of Ethereum, the second largest crypto in the world, appear to be on a different trajectory. On-chain data has shown that while Bitcoin whales hoard their coins, Ethereum whales appear to be dumping their holdings in recent years. Bitcoin Whales Buying More, Ethereum Whales Selling Bitcoin whales, meaning the largest holders with 1000 BTC or greater, have been steadily accumulating more BTC since 2018, according to data from on-chain analytics firms. However, there have been sell-offs, either through extended bear markets or during profit-taking after a strong bullish uptrend. A research analyst for Cryptoslate named James Straten posted on social media that Ethereum whales with more than 1,000 ETH have been selling since the same period. While sharing a Glassnode chart, he shared a correlation between the whales of the blockchains. On-chain data shows ETH whales have offloaded 20 million ETH since 2022, with 12 million ETH being sold off this year alone. Possible Explanation For The Contrasting Whale Activity The story these on-chain metrics tell provides insight into the prevailing mood among large crypto holders of different blockchains.  Although the amount of ETH held by whales might indicate they have sold or moved their funds to other cryptocurrencies, a better possibility is that these whales transferred their ETH into Ethereum smart contracts. Since Ethereum version 2.0 kickstarted its journey in December 2020, the number of tokens in the staking protocol has grown significantly.  ETH 2.0 requires validators to stake 32 ETH in its deposit contract to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. At the moment, the contract now has 31.2 million ETH worth $48.6 billion locked. This seems consistent with on-chain data, which shows that the percentage of supply tied in smart contracts overtook the supply in addresses holding 1000+ ETH in late 2020.  Crypto research analyst André Dragosch shared this correlation on social media platform X. The correlation buttresses that the Glassnode data doesn&#8217;t consider the ETH tied in smart contracts for its whale supply metric. With a domination of 17.8% over the whole cryptocurrency market, the Ethereum blockchain continues to solidify its position as the undisputed leader of smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin whales, bullish ETH whales are not just HODLing but employing techniques to maximize their crypto gains.

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to build on its recent momentum over the past week, reflecting the bearish climate of the general market. However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that investors continue to show significant faith in the premier cryptocurrency and its prospects. Bitcoin Addresses With 10+ BTC Reach All-Time High: Santiment According to a recent report from the blockchain data tracker Santiment, there has been considerable growth within a particular class of Bitcoin investors. The on-chain analytics platform highlighted that the number of shark and whale addresses holding at least 10 BTC has notably increased since early 2022. The report disclosed that an additional 11,806 addresses hold more than 10 BTC, reflecting an 8.12% increase in the past 20 months. Based on data from Santiment, are currently 157,400 wallets holding at least 10 Bitcoin, surpassing its record high set in 2019. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals Another recent Santiment report has strengthened the Bitcoin accumulation argument even more. The number of addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC witnessed its largest spike in a single day since February 2022. 🐳 #Bitcoin&#8216;s whale numbers had another huge accumulation day. 16 more wallets now hold between 100-1K $BTC, and they correlate with smaller wallets &#8216;graduating&#8217; to the next tier. As key stakeholders grow, the argument for a #bullish future gets stronger. https://t.co/DOvRLpGspw pic.twitter.com/EQW8jZsTtn — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 14, 2023 The October 14 report revealed that 16 additional addresses 100 to 1,000 BTC. Sentiment noted that this particular scenario goes in tandem with the accumulation trend of smaller wallets (addresses with at least 10 BTC). Ultimately, these significant on-chain developments indicate a steady accumulation of Bitcoin despite price fluctuations and market instability. Meanwhile, Santiment pointed out that the case for a bullish trajectory becomes more apparent as key Bitcoin investors grow. BTC Price &#8211; Overview As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $26,901, with negligible price movement in the past day. However, a broader look at the BTC price chart shows that the cryptocurrency has struggled in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin experienced a 3.7% price decline in the last seven days. After failing to breach the $28,000 mark, the premier cryptocurrency saw its price crash towards $26,500 for the first time in October.

    "description": "XRP has struggled to regain bullish price momentum this month, with the crypto going on six days of red candle close last week. The XRP community appears to be feeling the effects of this lack of momentum, as speculations have begun to circulate about a potential catalyst for the next XRP price surge. Related Reading: What To Expect This Month For XRP Price According To Historical Data Word on the street now is that Ripple plans to burn the 41.9 billion XRP tokens they have locked up in escrow. Although this hasn&#8217;t been confirmed yet, some say this move could send the value of XRP skyrocketing. The Potential Impact Of A Full Escrow Token Burn Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, currently holds billions of XRP in escrow. As of the time of writing, Ripple has 41.9 billion XRP locked up, with 1 billion XRP released from escrow each month. This huge stockpile of XRP has led to criticism that Ripple could flood the market at any time and crash the price.  However, rumors are swirling that Ripple may burn all of the XRP in escrow, potentially spiking up the price of XRP. If Ripple eliminated all of the escrowed XRP, it would significantly decrease the total supply of XRP and could positively impact the market price.  The rumor was started on social media X by the account @realXRPwhale and has elicited a response from community members. Although unverified, the account posted the update of Ripple, burning the &#8220;50 BILLION $XRP.&#8221;  While some have shown enthusiasm regarding the price effect if this happens, others have dismissed it as just a baseless rumor.  What’s Next For XRP? Ripple has never acknowledged or refuted rumors that it will destroy all of its tokens held in escrow, but this is not the first time that such a rumor has emerged suggesting that the technology company will do so. But the possibility of this happening is not completely out of the question, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned in a 2021 interview. Other factors that could drive up XRP prices include major partnerships by Ripple and a clear outcome of the ongoing case with the US Security and Exchange Commission. However, one thing that&#8217;s going so well is the increased recognition of XRP after a US judge declared that the token isn’t a security.  Related Reading: Road To $1? Analyst Forecasts 1,500% Price Rally For Dogecoin At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.4863 and is within a range as it looks to break above $0.5.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-surpass-gold-silver/",
    "description": "On Tuesday, an anonymous crypto analyst from a popular YouTube channel InvestAnswer shared more light on the future of Bitcoin. The analyst revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) is set to surpass both Gold and Silver in market capitalization in no more than a decade. BTC Is A Safer Haven Than Gold And Silver Over the years, Bitcoin has been regarded as digital gold due to the fact that the cryptocurrency offers the same benefits as gold with even additional features. In times of economic and political turbulence, BTC has been seen as a safe haven. In the YouTube video, the crypto analyst was able to highlight the underlying difference between Bitcoin and Gold, since Silver is no longer a safe haven and gold has been a more reliable precious metal than Silver. Related Reading: What To Expect If Historical Bitcoin Halving Cycles Repeat According to the crypto analyst, there has been distraught among the crypto community on the idea of whether the paper versions of gold and Bitcoin can change their real-world prices and potential price manipulations by financial giants such as JPMorgan and Blackrock.  However, the analyst was kind to shed more light on the growing issue in the YouTube video. He said, &#8220;For gold, it’s impossible to know if there is a gold backing to the paper that exists, which makes things very risky. On the other hand with Bitcoin, it’s much easier to prove and check making it much more trustworthy.” In addition, the analyst stated that he strongly believes that Bitcoin will surpass Gold in 8-10 years, not just because of the preceding reasons but because the cryptocurrency can be so easy to verify. &#8220;Believe me, forget the other 20 advantages that Bitcoin has over gold. I believe Bitcoin will smash gold performance over the next 8 to 10 years because you can verify. Therefore, I know a lot of people are worried about paper and manipulation by the JPMorgan and the BlackRocks of the world but they can’t because it can be so easily verified.&#8221; he stated. Another crypto analyst David Waugh, the lead analyst of Coinbits, has also backed the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, Bitcoin&#8217;s technological developments make it a superior asset over gold. He further added that the crypto&#8217;s improvements in divisibility, portability, durability, verifiability, and scarcity make the digital asset a more efficient and reliable store of value.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/road-to-1-analyst-forecasts-1500-price-rally-for-dogecoin/",
    "description": "Recently, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme coin by market cap, has struggled alongside the general cryptocurrency market. However, the latest price action displays an exciting and positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a fresh insight on Dogecoin, speculating on a forthcoming price rally for the meme token. The Dogecoin Descending Triangle Formation Ali Martinez &#8211; via a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform &#8211; put forward a $1 price target for Dogecoin. This price projection revolves around the multi-year descending triangle formation on DOGE’s weekly price chart. The descending triangle is a prominent technical analysis pattern that indicates a bearish market trend. Although it is often a bearish sign that suggests a downward trend breakout, it can also be a significant reversal pattern. In this particular scenario, the Dogecoin price has been in a continuous downward trend since May 2021. Prior to this sustained bearish run, the cryptocurrency had enjoyed a parabolic climb, with the price of DOGE claiming the $0.7 level (an all-time high) in April 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals As already inferred, this positive run was short-lived, with the meme coin dropping to a low of $0.058 in October 2022. While the Dogecoin price has momentarily touched the $0.1 mark a couple of times since then, it currently trades in a range &#8211; and around the same $0.058 price. In the highlighted weekly chart, DOGE’s price is approaching the apex of the descending triangle pattern. Based on this formation, Martinez foresees a significant bullish run for Dogecoin if a weekly candlestick closes above $0.0835. According to the analyst, this fresh bull run could see the meme coin’s value skyrocket to as high as $1, implying a significant 1,580% rally from the current price point. Watch Out For This Level, Analyst Says While the chances of a new bull run seem strong for Dogecoin, the possibility of a fall still lurks. Specifically, Ali Martinez touted $0.0482 as a price level to look out for. Related Reading: Analyst Expects The Worst For Bitcoin: Will Bears Force Prices To $17,000? This price zone, which is at the base of the descending triangle, represents a significant support zone. The analyst said any weakness around this area could cause the DOGE price to reach a new yearly low. As of this writing, Dogecoin is valued at $0.059329, reflecting a 1.7% price jump in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the meme token’s daily trading volume stands at $163.3 million, representing a negligible 0.2% increase in the past day. Dogecoin still ranks amongst the 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the market, with a market cap of over $8.3 billion.

    "description": "The FTX estate has reportedly staked 5.5 million Solana (SOL), worth $122 million. This development comes amidst fears of the defunct crypto exchange liquidating a substantial portion of its SOL holdings and inducing a bearish trend. FTX Renews Bullish Interest In Solana With Latest Move On October 14, blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported that 5.5 million SOL had been transferred between two unknown wallets. Thereafter, a crypto analyst with the X username ashpool soon identified the FTX exchange to be behind this whale transaction. Using data from gelato.sh, ashpool revealed that the FTX exchange had delegated the said 5.5 million SOL to the Figment staking service, an active validator on the Solana network.  In September, the management of the bankrupt crypto exchange obtained court approval to liquidate its crypto holdings, valued at $3.4 billion, as they look to pay off their creditors. Solana accounts for the largest part of FTX’s crypto assets, with the exchange reportedly owning 55.8 million SOL, worth $1.16 billion.  However, the majority of this SOL are currently staked, with FTX reportedly having access to 7 million SOL as of September, most of which had been sold off.  Related Reading: Cardano, Solana, And Ethereum Under Heat, Data Points To More Trouble For Altcoins On October 6, 9.1 million SOL, worth about $212 million, owned by Alameda Research &#8211; FTX’s defunct trading wing &#8211; were reportedly unstaked, prompting new fears of market sell-off by the FTX estate.  However, FTX’s latest move to stake 5.5 million SOL shows the exchange is holding on to its SOL investments for now, which could be interpreted as a reassuring move for traders with fears of liquidation. Despite its bankrupt status, FTX is still considered a major player in the Solana ecosystem, owning 10% of SOL’s total supply. In addition to its SOL holdings, FTX also owns 20,500 BTC worth $560 million and 112,600 ETH, worth $192 million, among other crypto assets.  Related Reading: No Love For FTX: Ex-Girlfriend Delivers Scathing Testimony Against Sam Bankman-Fried SOL Up By 16% In One Month In other news, SOL is up by 16.06% in the last months despite fears of liquidation and worrying factors linked to the FTX exchange.  Most recently, there were circulating rumors that the defunct exchange could “switch off” the Solana blockchain if it found the need to liquidate the long position of traders. However, these rumors were soon debunked by multiple accounts as fake. In fact, Jacob Creech, Head of Developers at Solana, drew the community’s attention to the fact there is a $400,000 SOL bounty for anyone who can find a “switch off” for the network.   At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $21.98, with a 2.34% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 10.18% and is valued at $267.07 million.
