    "description": "<p>United States Congressman Warren Davidson has filed a new bill called the SEC Stabilization Act, which looks to restructure the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the key provisions in the bill is the dismissal of currency SEC Chair Gary Gensler.&nbsp;</p>\nThe SEC Stabilization Act&nbsp;\n<p>The new bill filed by Davidson calls for the immediate dismissal of current Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler and the restructuring of the SEC to better protect the markets. Rep Davidson, in a statement, added,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come. It&rsquo;s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The representative used the hashtag &ldquo;FireGaryGensler,&rdquo; adding that the United States markets must be protected from the SEC Chair. He was joined by the Republican Party&rsquo;s majority whip, Tom Emmer, who Davidson quoted as stating,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;American investors and industry deserve clear and consistent oversight, not political gamesmanship. The SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC&rsquo;s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless Chair.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tom Emmer co-authored the bill.</p>\nStructural Changes&nbsp;\n<p>According to Davidson, apart from the removal of Gensler, the bill will also look to restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission, redistributing power between the SEC and its commissioners. It will also add a sixth commissioner to the agency so that no single party can have a majority over the commission and create an executive director position that would handle all day-to-day operations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Davidson and Emmer did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies or the crypto ecosystem in their statements, both are known to be extremely pro-crypto. Furthermore, both are also highly critical of Gensler&rsquo;s leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emmer has previously called Genser a &ldquo;bad faith regulator,&rdquo; while Davidson is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee&rsquo;s new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion.&nbsp;</p>\nCrypto Community Pushes Back Against Gensler&nbsp;\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s latest action against Coinbase and Binance has not been met warmly by the crypto community. Many brought up old videos of Gensler and his views on crypto. One such video shows the SEC Chair teaching blockchain technology at MIT. Another video that has garnered significant controversy is that of Gensler telling hedge funds that Ethereum and Litecoin are not securities. These videos and many more have left the crypto community seething at what they perceive as blatant hypocrisy. Gensler has also previously showered praise on Algorand, but later called ALGO a security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The crypto community has also pointed to the fact that the SEC Chair has close ties with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Senator Warren is notoriously anti-crypto, with the crypto community wondering if she has a role to play in Gensler&rsquo;s recent outbursts against crypto. Many in the crypto space believe that Gensler is out to kill the crypto industry, with the regulatory action against Coinbase and Binance the latest salvo against the industry.</p>\n<p>The SEC made its position against crypto clear when it launched regulatory action against Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bull-narrative-bitcoin-crypto-china-stimulus-package/",
    "description": "The Bitcoin and crypto market may have received yet another bullish narrative from China. As reported by Bloomberg, the country is mulling a major stimulus package to kick-start an economic recovery following the rebooting of the economy after the restrictive Corona measures. In light of Hong Kong&#8217;s recent opening to cryptocurrency trading by retail investors, a new bullish narrative is therefore emerging, as renowned expert Lex Moskovski explained via Twitter. According to him, the Chinese stimmies could go directly into &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; (allusion to the classification of altcoins by SEC chairman Gary Gensler). Chinese stimmies going into your unregistered securities. Here&#8217;s your bullish narrative. https://t.co/HjaB3fliC3 — Lex Moskovski (@mskvsk) June 13, 2023 China Mulls Stimulus Package According to the report, China is considering a comprehensive package of stimulus measures as pressure mounts on Xi Jinping&#8217;s government to revive the second-largest economy. Anonymous sources claim the proposals include at least a dozen measures to support areas such as real estate and domestic demand. A particular focus is reportedly on China&#8217;s beleaguered real estate market, which is to be a key part of the package. Chinese regulators reportedly want to lower the cost of outstanding residential mortgages and boost lending by the country&#8217;s policy banks to ensure that homes are delivered. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation In addition, interest rate cuts by the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) are also said to be under consideration. Speculation on this already arose recently after the central bank unexpectedly cut its seven-day reverse repo rate. However, it is important to stress that the stimulus plan has yet to be finalized and could therefore be subject to change. Nevertheless, China&#8217;s State Council could discuss the measures as early as this Friday. Still, it is unclear when they will be announced or implemented, the report states. What Impact Could The Package Have On Bitcoin And Crypto? While investors in the broader financial market are likely to welcome the Chinese authorities&#8217; plans, much will depend on the final scope and composition of the stimulus measures to assess the extent to which Bitcoin and crypto may also benefit from the stimulus package. Nevertheless, the package and Hong Kong&#8217;s recent opening on June 1st are an interesting development with regard to cryptocurrencies. The liberal Hong Kong is considered a gateway for wealthy Chinese to invest in foreign assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s (BTC) Key Indicator Points Bullish Continuation Despite Recent Dip Meanwhile, the hoped-for &#8220;China effect&#8221; on the Bitcoin and crypto market has not yet materialized, in part because the registration of exchanges is rather slow. For example, Coinbase only received an invitation from Hong Kong lawmakers to apply in the region yesterday, as Bitcoinist reported. In the US, the $1,200 stimulus checks had a measurable impact on Bitcoin. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, there was a &#8220;significant increase&#8221; in Bitcoin purchases of $1,200 in April 2020. Furthermore, the central bank noted that overall Bitcoin trading volumes increased by about 3.8% in response to the distribution of the first stimulus checks. While the environment in China is not comparable to that in the US, a similar effect could still be possible.
