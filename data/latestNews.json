    "description": "BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, announced the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) launch in Brazil on Thursday. Starting today, Friday, March 1, shares of this index fund, which tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC), will be traded on the Brazilian Commodities and Futures Exchange, known as B3. BlackRock Launches IBIT39 Bitcoin ETF In Brazil Karina Saade, president of BlackRock in Brazil, highlighted the company&#8217;s commitment to providing high-quality access vehicles to investors in the digital asset market. She stated: IBIT39 is a natural progression of our efforts over many years and builds on the fundamental capabilities we have established so far in the digital asset market.

He noted that the market, which started in 2021, now has 13 ETFs with total assets of R$2.5 billion, or about $505 million. While the market experienced fluctuations in its early years, it reached an eye-catching daily trading volume of R$30 million reais ($6.6 million) by the end of last year, according to local media reports in Brazil.  Gonçalves mentioned that investors in crypto ETFs include institutional investors, such as funds, and individual investors, with a current number of 170,000. Liquidity in the market is provided by non-residents investing in B3 as a whole. IBIT39 will reportedly have a management fee of 0.25%, with a one-year waiver that reduces the fee to 0.12% once the fund reaches its first $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). The product will be made available to the general public, allowing broader participation in the Bitcoin market. $7.5B Net Inflow In Bitcoin ETFs Since Launch In The US BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust) ETF has emerged as a notable player in the US ETF race, countering a significant outflow from Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). BitMEX research data shows that on February 29, 2024, positive flows amounted to $92 million for the day. Notably, BlackRock and GBTC offset each other, experiencing $600 million in opposite directions. The data shows that since the ETFs began trading on January 11, 2024, there has been an impressive net inflow of $7.5 billion.

It&#8217;s essential to consider that the total BTC supply currently in circulation is 19.64 million, with a maximum limit of 21 million.  With this context, the fact that the ETFs have secured 4% of the total BTC supply is a significant milestone. It demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin among investors utilizing these index funds to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. BTC continues to consolidate above the $62,000 mark, rising 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
