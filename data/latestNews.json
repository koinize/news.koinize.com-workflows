    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-5000-0-001/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja recently outlined his price targets for several crypto tokens after the fast-approaching Bitcoin Halving. Although he included price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, his ambitious price target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) was what caught the attention of the crypto community.  Shiba Inu To Hit $0.001 After The Halving Pantoja predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu could rise to $0.001 after the Bitcoin Halving occurs later this month. As expected, this price prediction has raised eyebrows, considering SHIB’s current price level. Moreover, a rise to $0.001 represents a 5,000% gain for the meme coin, which already looked to have used up its bullish momentum in the 2021 bull run when it recorded a price increase of 46,000,000%. Related Reading: ADA Price Ready To Soar As Cardano Network Hits New 88.6 Million Transaction Milestone Interestingly, Pantoja’s prediction isn’t the most bullish price prediction made for Shiba Inu so far. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez previously predicted that the meme coin could rise to as high as $0.011, although he didn’t state when exactly this would happen. Some other crypto analysts have also given their thoughts on SHIB’s future trajectory, although not as bullish as Pantoja and Martinez’s predictions.  Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox predicted that SHIB could see a 300% gain before year-end. Additionally, he suggested that the meme coin could see a new all-time high of $0.00008854. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also predicted that Shiba Inu could rise to as high as $0.0001553 at some point in this market cycle.  Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, for his part, cautioned crypto investors against expecting similar returns to the one SHIB recorded in the last bull run. He stated that those investing in the meme coin are unlikely to see as much as a 20 times return on their investment.  XRP To Rise To $10 Pantoja also predicted that XRP could rise to between $3 and $10 after the Halving. This is another eye-catching price prediction considering XRP’s current price level and how much the crypto token has continued to lag despite the impressive gains recorded in the broader crypto market.  Related Reading: Breakout Of The Year? Crypto Analyst Predicts Where NEAR Is Headed Next However, Pantoja isn’t the only crypto analyst who believes that XRP could rise to $10. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently mentioned that XRP rising to $10 is possible since Ethereum rising to $10,000 is feasible. Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, also shares similar sentiments. He previously predicted that XRP could rise to $10 based on predictions that Bitcoin and Ethereum will rise to $150,000 and $10,000, respectively.  This might also have been why Pantoja predicted that XRP could attain this price level; he also predicted that Bitcoin could rise to between $150,000 and $250,000 while Ethereum could rise to between $10,000 and $20,000.  SHIB price begins to show strength &#124; Source: SHIBUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Coinpedia, chart from Tradingview.com"
