    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-rise-1700-11/",
    "description": "Popular crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently dropped a very bullish prediction for the Cardano (ADA) price. This analyst claims ADA is poised to surge to $11 in the next extended bull cycle, an incredible 1700% gain from its current price level. Unlike many, the analyst didn&#8217;t just pull that prediction out of thin air. According to him, the prediction was solely based on ADA’s historical data and past actions. $11 Cardano is a very realistic figure for bull market high based on new data I just discovered. Video later explaining why. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 12, 2023 Prediction Based on Historical Price Analysis Cardano has had one of the best price gains among major altcoins this year. This price spike has brought in predictions from various analysts, with some predicting very bullish price points than others. According to a video shared by Gambardello, if history repeats itself, ADA could spike to a market cap of $400 billion by 2025. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Uncanny Similarities In The Bitcoin Charts Of 2020 And 2023 How did he come by this number? Well, data has shown that the price of Cardano (ADA) has always correlated with Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) past actions. A weekly timeframe chart shared by the analyst in a video on social media platform X showed that the last bull run in 2021 which saw ADA reach its current all-time high of $3.10 was a mirror of ETH&#8217;s performance in 2017. During the bull run in 2021, ADA spiked to a total market cap of $93 billion, a 75% correlation with ETH&#8217;s $123 billion at the 2017 peak. It&#8217;s important to note that at this first stage, both Ethereum and Cardano weren&#8217;t well known for their DeFi capability. Now, it looks like ADA is getting ready to enter the 2021 Ethereum first DeFi bull cycle phase where it peaked at a market cap of $546 billion. Cardano&#8217;s blockchain has grown since the first stage, with the network now one of the fastest-growing in terms of DeFi and smart contracts. If this cycle is consistent with the previous one, a 75% performance of ETH&#8217;s market cap peak will put that of ADA at $409 billion by 2025. At this point, ADA could speculatively be at a 4% total crypto market dominance and peak over $11. ADA price at $0.65 &#124; Source: ADAUSD On Tradingview.com Gambardello correctly predicted ADA&#8217;s all-time high of over $3 in June 2020, one year before the crypto reached this price point. The analyst also noted another scenario where the spike doesn&#8217;t mirror 75% of Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi cycle. According to him, a lesser market cap of $350 billion would put ADA at $10, way higher than its current all-time high. Related Reading: Analyst Sees Bitcoin Move To $69,000 As Cup And Handle Pattern Appears Current State Of Cardano ADA is currently on a 13.81% gain in the past 24 hours, boosted by a $1.5 billion increase in whale transactions. The crypto shot through to $0.6776, registering a new yearly high. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.6527, a 73% increase from its December open of $0.376. According to another social media post by Dan Gambardello, Cardano is now at a decision point between a continued increase to $0.75 and a retrace to $0.41.
