    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-analyst-reveals-10-top-altcoins-to-watch-this-week/",
    "description": "The altcoins market has recently witnessed a resurgence of interest and confidence, primarily driven by the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). This renewed enthusiasm has resulted in a bull uptrend, with most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies benefiting from Bitcoin&#8217;s resurgence.  However, the market is currently experiencing a correction as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) face pullbacks after failed attempts to breach upper resistance lines. Despite this correction, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher shares insights and highlights several altcoins with potentially significant gains. SOL Emerges As Safe Haven In Crypto Market Correction Solana has exhibited remarkable growth, even as the broader market experiences a correction. With a 0.5% gain in the past 24 hours, SOL&#8217;s potential for further upside cannot be ignored.  Deutscher suggests that SOL may continue to benefit from the ongoing rotation of investments from other Layer-1 solutions like Avalanche (AVAX) and Fantom (FTM). Thorchain (RUNE) has been on an impressive upward trajectory, prompting investors to consider buying on deep corrections and wicks. The primary decentralized exchange (DEX) on Thorchain, THOR, has also shown positive movement, further bolstering the growth potential. Polygon (MATIC) has recently shown signs of strength and has generated whispers within the crypto community about a potential zero-knowledge (ZK) narrative. If this narrative materializes, MATIC, a leader in the space, could attract significant positive flows.  Related Reading: Cardano: Midnight Devnet Goes Live – Trigger For New ADA Rally? Within the ZK narrative, altcoins like Dusk Network (DUSK), Loopring (LRC), and Mina Protocol (MINA) are poised to benefit. Deutscher believes that each altcoin offers unique strengths and value propositions, and their performance will depend on the strength of the emerging ZK narrative. Soteria (SEI) has gained attention as it enters the top 10 for volume traded by pairs on Upbit. Considered a &#8220;new coin,&#8221; SEI exhibits fundamentals similar to the next altcoin on the watchlist. Tidal Finance (TIA) is a relatively new token similar to the early days of Aptos (APT). The market tends to favor new and innovative tokens, and although TIA&#8217;s rally may have started to cool off, it still holds explosive potential. With a current market capitalization of $700 million, TIA remains an intriguing opportunity for investors. DEX And Gaming Altcoins Poised To Thrive In addition to altcoins, perp decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens like GMX, DYDX, and Gnosis (GNS) are positioned to benefit from market volatility. According to Deutscher, these tokens have shown a correlation between price movements and fundamental factors. If volatility persists, these tokens could present favorable medium-term investment opportunities. Yield Guild Games (YGG) and Gamestarter (GMT), gaming tokens with initial upward movements, are expected to continue outperforming the broader market. These gaming tokens could witness sustained growth with the YGG conference scheduled for November 18.
