    "description": "Peter Schiff, a well-known critic of Bitcoin, recently engaged in a thought-provoking discussion about Bitcoin’s value relative to gold. Despite his longstanding skepticism, Schiff has presented a scenario where Bitcoin could reach roughly $10 million by 2031. However, the Bitcoin critic responded that this could happen under particular economic conditions. Schiff&#8217;s Extreme Hypothesis On Bitcoin&#8217;s Ascent To $10 Million This bold statement arises from the Economist&#8217;s comparison of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential growth trajectory to gold, highlighting the volatility of crypto assets and the spirited optimism of their proponents. No matter how low the price of #Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim its outperformed #gold. For example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 26, 2024 Commenting under this post, an X user asked, &#8220;What if Bitcoin goes to $10,000,00 by 2031?&#8221; Schiff then replied with a &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; scenario that pivots on the dramatic collapse of the US dollar, akin to the fate of the German Papiermark post-World War I. During that period, Germany experienced rampant hyperinflation, devastating the value of its currency. Related Reading: Expert Calms Mt. Gox Bitcoin Liquidation Worries, Says “Creditors Aren’t Likely To Sell Soon” Schiff suggests that only if a similar downfall of the US dollar happens does the BTC price catapult to $10 million. However, it’s important to note that this scenario is highly &#8220;hypothetical,&#8221; and the crypto critic is trying to convey that Bitcoin can only reach $10 million in an &#8220;extreme&#8221; case of economic turmoil. If the U.S. dollar goes the way of the German Papiermark then I supposed that&#8217;s possible. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 26, 2024 Community Reactions To Schiff&#8217;s Post Notably, Schiff remains a staunch critic of Bitcoin. He recently expressed concerns about potential regulatory changes under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. He predicted increased regulations could raise Bitcoin&#8217;s transaction costs and adversely affect its market value. The crypto community, however, often counters Schiff’s bearish outlook with a mix of criticism and humor. Influential figures like Samson Mow and Mike Alfred have directly responded to Schiff&#8217;s comparisons between Bitcoin and gold, often highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and growth over the years. Bro, in 2011 when gold was $2k and BTC was $10 you said BTC was going to zero and everyone should buy gold. 13 years later and gold is still at $2k and BTC is at $40,000. Just stop. — Jeff Berwick (@BerwickJeff) January 26, 2024 Mow, in particular, has pointed out that once Bitcoin surpasses gold’s market cap, gold could be relegated to its &#8220;industrial utility cost.&#8221; Once #Bitcoin surpasses gold’s market cap, gold will be demonetized to its industrial utility cost. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 26, 2024 These responses from the crypto community showcase the strong belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s potential and its role in shaping the future of global finance.
