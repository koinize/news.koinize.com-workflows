The country is expected to see gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year, the IMF <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/07/07/republic-of-the-marshall-islands-concluding-statement-of-the-2023-article-iv-consultation-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">concluded</a>, in a recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and the contraction of its fishing industry. Climate change and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) remain a threat, however. </p><p>The RMI is spread across more than 1,000 islands in the Central Pacific region. It has an average elevation of six feet above sea level and a population of about 56,000. With a 2022 GDP of $261 million, the sale of a single fishing boat led to a drop in GDP of 4.5% that year. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is what it’s like to fly in the Marshall Islands on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@united</a> Island Hopper. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/travel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#travel</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lzkcHwLu6b\">pic.twitter.com/lzkcHwLu6b</a></p>&mdash; Jennifer Broome (@JenniferBroome) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferBroome/status/1677474984133017600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Fiscal reforms are needed in the RMI ahead of a new Compact of Free Association with the United States that goes into effect in 2024, the IMF said,  and fintech initiatives “pose risks to financial integrity of the RMI.”</p><p>The RMI <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/legal-daos-why-are-the-marshall-islands-betting-on-a-decentralized-future\">passed legislation recognizing</a> DAOs as legal entities and then <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-legally-recognizes-daos-as-domestic-limited-liability-companies\">allowed them to incorporate</a> there as limited liability companies in 2022 — moves that made the IMF profoundly uneasy. It said:</p><blockquote>“The enactment of the DAO Act and the move to start registration of DAOs […] are especially concerning given the capacity constraints and questions regarding the understanding of the authorities to adequately regulate and supervise these initiatives.” </blockquote><p>The IMF advised the RMI to place a moratorium on DAO registration. The country should first create a monetary authority, the IMF advised. It is not clear whether any DAOs have been registered in the RMI yet.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/legal-daos-why-are-the-marshall-islands-betting-on-a-decentralized-future\">Legal DAOs: Why is the Marshall Islands betting on a decentralized future?</a></em></strong></p><p>The country is also in danger of losing its last U.S. dollar correspondent account because of concerns about its fintech and “offshore sector” related to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. The loss of correspondent accounts, known as derisking, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-caribbean-is-pioneering-cbdcs-with-mixed-results-amid-banking-difficulties\">isolates a country</a> from the international economy and is considered controversial from the perspective of social justice. </p><p>The IMF also advised the RMI to repeal the SOV, its central bank digital currency (CBDC). While the IMF <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/imf-new-class-cross-border-payment-platform-single-ledger\">is generally favorably inclined</a> toward CBDCs, it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-digital-currency-would-raise-risks-says-imf\">pressed the RMI to back away</a> from its CBDC project in its 2021 consultation as well, saying the country was unprepared for it.
