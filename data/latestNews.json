A satoshi is 100 millionth of a Bitcoin. Identifying a fractionalized part of a Bitcoin means creating NFTs on Bitcoin or creating a provenance certificate on-chain is now possible. The idea of NFTs on Bitcoin, the most decentralized OG chain, is tantalizing for some. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image5.jpg\" alt=\"Recursive Inscriptions are difficult to understand but have heaps of potential\" class=\"wp-image-23093\" width=\"482\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image5.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image5-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Recursive Inscriptions are difficult to understand but have heaps of potential. (Pexels)</figcaption></figure><p>In January 2023, developer Casey Rodarmor released the Ordinals protocol, creating Bitcoin NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rodarmor found an unintended loophole in the taproot scripts that command lines of Bitcoin code.</p><p>The Ordinals protocol creator argues that such NFTs are now <a href=\"https://docs.ordinals.com/digital-artifacts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >complete</a>, as the token and related images are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain rather than side chains or using off-chain storage systems like most Ethereum NFTs. Digital artifacts on Bitcoin are truly immutable. </p><p>Now you can own the actual art, not just a contract that points at a piece of art stored on centralized databases, says Carlo Fox, an Ordinals OG since February who created the Nakamoto Whales series. NFTs, as we know them on Ethereum and on other chains, are more like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/can-someone-explain-to-me-why-nft-clones-are-selling-for-so-much/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >digital ownership certificates</a> than actual on-chain art, and Ordinals change that.  </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I got super excited for Ordinals for a few reasons: for one, we now can create and own on-chain art that is truly immutable. When you understand the ramifications of this, its huge.  Half the time, NFTs as we know them are stored on AWS, centralized, and controlled by creators who can turn your art into pictures of turds at any time. </p></blockquote><p>Ordinals allow you to store any type of data on the most decentralized blockchain, and no one can modify it. Ordinal artifacts may be most likely of any on-chain data to exist 2,000 years from now. Thats meaningful, and I think it is particularly relevant when in the context of important works of art, literature and science. I believe that Ordinals will become the premiere destination for the most coveted and important on-chain art. Its akin to carving a statue out of gold, says Fox.</p><p>So the business case for high-value NFTs minted on Bitcoin makes sense. Using the new tech to create cool 3D art for OCM Dimensions helped Yangs company Metagood sell the idea of launching tokens on Bitcoin Ordinals to Asprey Studios and the Italian car company Bugatti recently. </p><p>But OG Ordinals could only hold 4MB of data, and that is one reason why recursive inscriptions have emerged.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3469.jpg\" alt=\"Fox launched the Nakamoto Whales Ordinals collection\" class=\"wp-image-23094\" width=\"699\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3469.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3469-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fox launched the Nakamoto Whales Ordinals collection: (Twitter)</figcaption></figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recursive inscriptions = Bitcoin cloud computing</h3><p>At its most basic recursive inscriptions let you record stuff associated with a particular Bitcoin and enable smart contract-type functionality  Yang says they could have been called programmable inscriptions. By interlinking data through a series of calls (a contract for a sell order, for example), its possible to extract that data to run more complex processes anchored on Bitcoin blocks. </p><p>This enables recursive inscriptions to function like a distributed data repository, like putting AWS cloud on Bitcoin.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Recursive Inscriptions 101<br><br>TL;DR<br>A recursive inscription calls data from prior inscriptions.

With a one-time cost to inscribe, data could be hosted forever on the most immutable and decentralized network in the world.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image3.jpg\" alt=\"Recursive Inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements\" class=\"wp-image-23091\" width=\"365\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image3.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image3-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Recursive Inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements. (Pexels)</figcaption></figure><p>Inscriptions are like data legos, enabling data to be taken from somewhere else and built upon. In computer science, thats where the phrase recursive comes from, as recursive inscriptions are a mechanism that extracts data from existing inscriptions and utilizes that data within new inscriptions.</p><p>Recursion is a fully on-chain process that uses scripts to combine various other on-chain data sources. These can include image layers, audio, code or other data sources. Individual scripts of code merge these layers together through recursion. </p><p>Recursive inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements.</p><p>Fox uses the example of PFP art. Instead of uploading thousands of unique images (which can be prohibitively expensive), you can upload 200 and use scripts to combine them via the fully on-chain recursion process. The possibilities this offers are only just being explored.</p><p>This is powerful because recursive inscriptions enable new types of applications that were not possible before it. Applications like on-chain AI couldnt be done on the base layer of Ethereum, but NewBitcoinCity builder Punk 3700 believes they could now be done on Bitcoin. Hes been playing around with Perceptrons, an early on-chain AI experiment on Bitcoin.<br><br>He explains that it wasnt possible to store the AI neural net models on-chain together with the artworks. So we split the AI models into different inscriptions and compose them at runtime.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inscriptions an important development for human freedom?</strong></h2><p>One of the most fascinating elements of recursive inscriptions is that once the data is on the blockchain once, you can simply refer to it again and again, vastly cutting down storage costs and block space utilization. </p><p>Inscriptions are now reusable, explains Punk 3700, You can inscribe a very large code library like p5.js once, and other developers can reference that p5.js library at run time without inscribing it again. </p><p>This is super exciting because we start seeing a community-driven public infrastructure being built out. This means more complex inscriptions are being created at a fraction of the cost.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Essentially, any type of data can be an inscription. The most rudimentary use case combines multiple data sources together, and every piece of it can live on-chain. On-chain data might be able to communicate with each other, and data could be realized over time.</p></blockquote><p>Fox explains further: The best way to think of it is anything you can do locally on a computer and have all little pieces live together in different files and work together. </p><p>He gives examples like open-source libraries, all on-chain, meaning important research papers on Bitcoin, with citations on recursions on-chain, meaning major discoveries can be published on Bitcoin blocks for time immemorial. Javascript packages can be inscribed on Bitcoin. Essentially, a tiny internet thats developed to live on Bitcoin cant be taken down, building and building until one day it has created an interconnected supercomputer living on Bitcoin.</p><p>The public hasnt grasped the significance of these developments, says Fox. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What if you could play games that couldn&#39;t be shut down, run exactly as programmed without fraud or interference & could live far beyond our lifetimes?<br><br>Say GM to the era of Decentralized Games (dgames) on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >#Bitcoin</a> <br><br> <a href=\"https://t.co/5zV6MpFHd1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >https://t.co/5zV6MpFHd1</a><br><br>A thread  <a href=\"https://t.co/wYytBISiEV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/wYytBISiEV</a></p>— 3700 | New Bitcoin City (@punk3700) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/punk3700/status/1672259824191512576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >June 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lets start with DeFi and AWS first </h2><p>Long before the supercomputer cranks up, were likely to see Bitcoin DeFi and the chain emerge as a data storage competitor. </p><p>Toby Lewis co-founded OrdinalsBot, which automates inscriptions to help expedite development on Ordinals.
