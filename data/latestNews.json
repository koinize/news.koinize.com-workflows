    "description": "XRP has demonstrated significant strength for a while now, securing its spot as one of the best-performing cryptocurrency assets by market cap, after surging to its highest level since November. XRP To Yield Gains From April Rally The crypto community is buzzing about XRP&#8217;s latest price spike as several analysts predict the surge will be the start of the eagerly anticipated rally. With a 50% rise from $0.50 on Monday, March 11, to a weekly high of $0.75, it got off to a great start this week. Related Reading: XRP On The Brink – Bullish Pattern Or Profit-Taking Retreat? Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Dark Defender has shared his latest optimistic forecast for XRP with the community on X (formerly Twitter). Dark Defender highlighted that the crypto asset &#8220;broke out&#8221; from a strong resistance on Tuesday, just as he expected. XRP broke out from a 6-year-long symmetrical triangle, which denotes a phase of consolidation with prices bouncing between the lower support line and the upper resistance. According to the analyst, the monthly time frame clearly shows that the much-anticipated move has begun. Also, the daily time frame &#8220;confirms that the massive resistance level of $0.6649 has been broken.&#8221;  He further added that for the &#8220;weekly and monthly time frame, $0.6649 will possibly be confirmed.&#8221; As a result, Dark Defender underscored that his targets are now &#8220;closer to the mid-resistance around the $1.33&#8221; price mark. Meanwhile, he has placed his &#8220;Fibonacci price targets at $1.88 and $5.85 in the upcoming weeks.&#8221;  The post read: XRP had the break-out yesterday, as we expected. In the Monthly Time Frame, it is obvious the move has started and the huge Resistance of $0.6649 has been confirmed to be broken in the Daily. $0.6649 will be Confirmed for the Weekly and Monthly Frames. Our targets are closer now to $1.33 mid resistance, and $1.88 and $5.85 Fibonacci targets in the upcoming weeks. As a result, the expert has urged the community to watch out for &#8220;solid strikes&#8221; in the coming week. In addition, he noted that &#8220;April will be hot,&#8221; suggesting significant gains throughout the month. Presently, the digital asset gradually gaining strength trading at $0.6897, indicating a weekly increase of over 12%. However, its market cap and trading volume are both down by 1.58% and 57% in the last 24 hours. The Asset Does Not Belong In Your Portfolio Despite XRP&#8217;s latest rally, crypto expert Jason Pizzino has claimed that investing in the token might not be a smart move. Jason Pizzino has issued a warning to the community never to consider adding XRP to their portfolio. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Could Rocket 2,300% To $14.6, Here’s How He claims that &#8220;even though it climbs this cycle, it still &#8220;needs to rise more than 2600%&#8221; in value to match Bitcoin&#8216;s peak of 2017. &#8220;It achieved 500% in the previous cycle and is now only 30% away from shattering the SEC Lawsuit low,&#8221; he added. Pizzino believes that the major advantage of influencers discussing XRP is that there is still a &#8220;large audience interested&#8221; in knowing about the project and &#8220;optimistic price projects that never appear.&#8221; Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
