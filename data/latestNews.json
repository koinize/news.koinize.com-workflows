    "description": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase above the $2,280 resistance. ETH could gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above $2,350. Ethereum is slowly moving higher from the $2,240 support zone. The price is trading above $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a rising channel forming with resistance near $2,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it manages to clear the $2,350 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Stuck Below $2,400 Ethereum price correction gains and traded below the $2,300 level. However, ETH bulls were active near the $2,240 support zone. A low was formed near $2,241 and the price started an upward move, like Bitcoin. The price is still moving in a broad range below the $2,400 pivot zone. There was a minor increase above the $2,280 and $2,300 resistance levels. The price even tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,390 swing high to the $2,241 low. Ethereum is now trading above $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a rising channel forming with resistance near $2,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,315 level. The next major resistance is near $2,320 or the trend line. The next key resistance might be $2,350 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,390 swing high to the $2,241 low, above which the price might rise and test the $2,400 resistance. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com If the bulls push the price above the $2,400 resistance, they could aim for $2,480. A clear move above the $2,480 level might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level. Another Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,290 level or the 100 hourly SMA. The next key support could be the $2,240 zone. A clear move below the $2,240 support might send the price toward $2,200. The main support could be $2,120. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,080 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Level – $2,240 Major Resistance Level – $2,350"
