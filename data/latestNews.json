Aside from discussing the nascent ecosystem's benefits and risks, the regulator concluded it is yet to pose a sizeable risk to financial stability.</p><blockquote>“Crypto-assets markets, including DeFi, do not represent meaningful risks to financial stability at this point, mainly because of their relatively small size and limited contagion channels between crypto and traditional financial markets.”</blockquote><p>The total crypto market capitalization is just over $1 trillion, and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance\">DeFi</a> total value locked is a mere $40 billion, according to DefiLlama.

She didn’t provide any details on how Bankman-Fried planned to do it. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One more Caroline Ellison courtroom sketch. <br><br>This one featuring SBF himself! <a href=\"https://t.co/q3O6xqxEhl\">https://t.co/q3O6xqxEhl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cQJbj5V1H7\">pic.twitter.com/cQJbj5V1H7</a></p>&mdash; Ariel Givner, Esq.

His other top concerns included trading bonds issued by the Japanese government, buying Snap Inc (SNAP) stocks, and “Willie being happy.\" </p><p>While the list doesn’t specify who Willie was, the name was possibly a reference to Bankman-Fried’s mentor William MacAskill.</p><p>According to Ellison, Bankman-Fried blamed her for Alameda’s troubles and poor hedging. During the trial, Ellison admitted that a better hedge strategy could have helped Alameda face the crypto winter, but <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial-updates\">noted that the company also had large open-term loans</a> and had spent billions from its line of credit with FTX. </p><p>Open-term loans have no maturity date, meaning the borrower has a prepayment option, while the lender has a call option. In June, lenders such as Genesis Capital started enforcing their call option, requiring Alameda to repay millions of dollars. Under Bankman-Fried’s direction, Ellison repaid part of Alameda’s debts with funds from FTX customers. In September 2022, Alameda’s liabilities with FTX mounted $13.7 billion, while its open-term loans stood at $1.3 billion, she said.</p><p>In addition, and also at Bankman-Fried’s request, Ellison also created \"alternative\" spreadsheets for Alameda’s lenders, hiding the company's financial liabilities with FTX to make it \"look better\" and to keep lenders from calling for full repayment.</p><p>Ellison also revealed moments of emotional distress. Speaking calmly and firmly during the trial, she expressed her anxiety about the possibility of customers withdrawing their funds from FTX amid the “liquidity crush” at Alameda.</p><blockquote>\"Every day, I was worrying about the possibility of [loans] being called at the same time.\"</blockquote><p>Ellison's cross-examination by Bankman-Fried's defense will begin on Oct. 12. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "During the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, shocking revelations emerged from the testimony of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.  According to a TechCrunch report, Ellison testified that the crypto trading firm paid Chinese officials to unlock their Alameda trading accounts on OKX and Huobi in China. Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that Bankman-Fried was not charged with bribery in this case. Still, the evidence was presented to demonstrate trust, confidence, and motive between Bankman-Fried and Ellison. Alameda Research Former CEO Exposes Hidden Payments To Chinese Officials According to Ellison&#8217;s testimony, while Bankman-Fried was CEO in 2020, the accounts valued at approximately $1 billion were frozen.  Related Reading: Bulls Vs Bears: XRP Price Gears Up For Big Squeeze, Which Side Will Prevail? In November 2021, Bankman-Fried claimed that a colleague, David Ma, who had connections in China, found a way to unfreeze the accounts.  Ellison, who had become co-CEO of Alameda by then, made crypto transfers totaling around $100 million to $150 million to reopen the accounts, unaware that the payments were made to Chinese officials.  Ellison stated that Bankman-Fried and Sam Trabucco instructed her through a Signal chat to make the payments. Before the accounts were reopened, Ellison revealed that Alameda employees explored various strategies to unlock the accounts, including involving lawyers and government officials.  Ellison testified that they even considered using Thai prostitutes to open accounts on the exchanges to facilitate fund transfers, but these efforts were unsuccessful. One Alameda trader, &#8220;Handi,&#8221; resigned in early January 2022 due to her objection to paying bribes to Chinese officials, as her father held a government position.  Courtroom Clash Ellison testified that Handi had a heated argument with Bankman-Fried about the matter, during which he allegedly told her to &#8220;shut the fuck up.&#8221; A month after Handi&#8217;s resignation, Trabucco asked in a Signal chat if Handi&#8217;s father had immediately reported them, to which Bankman-Fried responded with &#8220;lol.&#8221; Ellison shared a list with prosecutors containing notes, one of which referred to a payment of &#8220;150m from the thing?&#8221; about the money transferred to regain the accounts.  Per the report, Ellison explained that she did not want to explicitly state in writing that the payment was made to China to unlock the accounts, fearing that it could be leaked and used against Alameda Research in court. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense lawyer, Mark Cohen, attempted to strike Ellison&#8217;s statement about avoiding written evidence of the payments, but Judge Kaplan overruled the request.

    "description": "Alon Muroch, the founder of SSV Network, has been drafted into the Israeli Army, according to an X post shared on October 10. Following this news, SSV, the native token of the SSV Network, fell 5%, dropping below the $14 mark. At this pace, SSV is moving closer to its all-time low of around $13.40, registered in September 2023. SSV Founder Getting Drafted In response to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, Muroch stated that the situation on the ground is &#8220;much worse than described.&#8221; The founder said that being drafted into the army might help &#8220;tip the scale&#8221; and improve the situation on the ground.  Related Reading: No Love For FTX: Ex-Girlfriend Delivers Scathing Testimony Against Sam Bankman-Fried The escalation in the Middle East as of this week has created a humanitarian crisis leading to loss of lives and destruction of property. As of writing on October 11, it is unclear whether Muroch has been mobilized and actively serving in the military.  Although this news didn&#8217;t immediately impact sentiment, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain picked out two notable transfers. Two addresses, &#8220;ikuvc.eth&#8221; and &#8220;0xF447,&#8221; deposited 18,055 SSV worth over $250,000 to Binance, a leading exchange.  Transfers to centralized exchanges usually indicate a potential intention to sell. Even so, it still needs to be determined whether these addresses have liquidated their tokens for other currencies, usually USDT or more liquid and stable tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).  SSV remains under pressure at spot rates. The token is down 5% on the last trading day, extending losses, collapsing from its all-time highs of nearly $100 when it first listed on Binance. Currently, SSV is down by over 95% from its peak, highlighting the dicey state of the token and how unfavorable the markets have been in the past eight months. SSV Network Still Under Development The SSV Network aims to strengthen Ethereum by allowing anyone to become a validator without necessarily operating a node. Ethereum is a proof-of-stake network reliant on a web of validators for security.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Litecoin Price At $84, Here’s The Timeline The SSV Network uses the Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). This system distributes the validator key among a network of non-trusting nodes. The platform allows anyone to stake ETH without running a full validator node, earning rewards. In doing so, SSV Network aims to make staking more decentralized and accessible while enhancing security and reliability. Currently, SSV Network is still in development and permissioned. However, they plan to update via a Permissionless Launch, broadening their base of operators and validators. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-drop-to-900/",
    "description": "Following the Terra LUNA network collapse back in 2022, the price of Ethereum followed the general market downtrend. As a result of this, the ETH price had fallen to a new cycle low of $900, before recovering once more. However, now that the altcoin is still deep in the throes of the bear market, questions have arisen once more about the chances of the price returning to its 2022 lows. Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Could Drop To $900 In an analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading presents a scenario in which the price of Ethereum could fall back toward its 2022 lows. The analysis in question takes into account the multiple bullish trend lines that the digital asset’s price had fallen through over the last year. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunge Drives Liquidation Above $30 Million, More Pain To Come? According to FieryTrading, Ethereum had one last remaining bullish line which had emerged on the chart back toward the bottom of the June 2022 sell-offs. However, the digital asset hasn’t been able to hold this trend line and they point out that “it’s well over a year old and must carry some weight.” ETH price could fall to $900 &#124; Source: Tradingview.com Due to this, the crypto analyst believes that the digital asset has entered into a long bearish stretch. As this bear stretch continues, which the analyst expects to be even longer, they see a high possibility of the Ethereum price reaching as low as $900 once more, as shown in the chart below. Despite being seemingly convinced about ETH’s price decline, the analysis still needs confirmation. Their explanation which is shown in the chart as well asks to wait for the price to break below the $1,510 level for this to take place. ETH price falls to $1,567 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bearish Going Into The Bitcoin Halving As the analyst explains, the bearish expectation is not localized to just the Ethereum price alone. It seems to encompass the whole market which the analyst believes has finished out its half bullish stretch and has now entered into the bearish half that often leads up to the halving. As the analyst puts it, this indicates “that it’s the turn of the bears by now.” This school of thought is not new and is actually backed up by historical data. When looking at the charts of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it shows that there was a bearish stretch leading up to the Bitcoin halving. After the event, this trend tends to reverse, which then signals the start of the bull market. Related Reading: Top 5 Altcoins For October 2023 That Could 20X Your Crypto Portfolio In the months leading up to the 2020 halving event, the price of Ethereum saw a sharp decline that put its price in the $120 region before picking back up.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/algorand/algorand-explorer-chatgpt-launched-algo-sellers/",
    "description": "GoPlausible, a team of developers building tools for people to create and use Algorand, has launched AlgorandExplorer. This explorer fuses the capabilities of ChatGPT to ease interaction with the public, proof-of-stake blockchain. Algorand is a smart contract platform similar to Ethereum, allowing users to deploy decentralized applications (dapps). In a Medium post on October 10, the team said the plugin aims to solve challenges facing Algorand indexers and eventually simplify exploring the smart contract platform. Ordinarily, users rely on indexers through which users can search and query the blockchain. This is because indexers have to create a searchable database holding all data, such as transactions, blocks, and more. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto CEO Delivers Bad News For The Altcoin Besides offering an interface for users to explore Algorand, the AlgorandExplorer supports &#8220;semantic conversational searches, enriching data with logs and related transactions,&#8221; allowing on-chain searches to &#8220;reason with data&#8221; more effectively. The explorer will integrate a language translation tool, meaning users from across the globe can explore Algorand using their native language.  Still, the AlgorandExplorer is under development. Eventually, in the coming version, the GoPlausible plans to include more enhancements, including Algorand Request for Comments (ARCs) and technical documentation.  Algorand is far from the only platform investing in AI; a few months ago, Solana announced their integration of a ChatGPT plugin focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The plugin, the foundation said, facilitates the buying and listing of NFTs. At the same time, it can interpret data and find the floor price of NFT collections listed on the blockchain. The floor price is the lowest price an NFT in a given collection can be sold. The ALGO Sell-Off Continues: Will Prices Sink To New Lows? While the move by the Algorand Foundation could see more users explore and analyze transactions on the smart contract platform, there has been no significant impact on prices. The ALGO sell-off was made worse by allegations made by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June that ALGO and other coins, including Axie Infinity (AXS) and Cardano (ADA), are unregistered securities.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See A 50% Rise Based On This, Analyst Explains Presently, ALGO remains under pressure, consolidating within a tight range defined by the sell-off recorded in August. Based on that formation, the coin is technically bearish and trending within the bear bar of August 17, a bearish engulfing bar that had high trading volume.  Thus far, looking at trackers, the coin is down by over 70% in the past year of trading. From the daily chart, ALGO is also edging lower, wiping gains posted in the first week of October. Technically, ALGO is edging closer to all-time lows registered in August, a net negative. The primary supports remain at $0.08. If broken in Q4 2023, the odds of ALGO sinking even lower, completely reversing gains of 2021, will be on the table.
