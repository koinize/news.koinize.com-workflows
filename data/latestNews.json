    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/dusk-s-preparedness-for-mica-compliance",
    "description": "<p>The European Union recently approved the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which came into force in June 2023, bringing crypto assets, crypto asset issuers, and crypto asset service providers under a single regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The MiCA regulations introduce increased transparency and create a comprehensive regulatory framework for service providers and issuers and compliance with anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, the new rules also cover asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins.</p>\nA Closer Look At MiCA\n<p>MiCA, or the Markets in Crypto Assets, is the new legislation adopted by the European Union on cryptocurrency, aiming to bring greater clarity to the crypto ecosystem in the EU. The introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation represents a significant step forward for the crypto industry and is the most significant effort yet to bring transparency to the sector. MiCA will provide stakeholders with a clear set of rules, definitions, and guidelines for companies operating in different spheres of the crypto space, such as custody, trading, and marketing of crypto assets.</p>\n<p>MiCA also puts significant emphasis on stablecoins, which are digital assets whose value is typically backed by fiat currency, although they could be backed by other assets as well. It introduces heavy compliance requirements for stablecoin operators, thus ensuring that these assets are stable, secure, and not subjected to any fraud. MiCA also requires entities offering crypto assets to provide a whitepaper that contains information about the issuer, obligations, capital raised, and the underlying technology behind the asset. According to MiCA, this would help improve transparency and fuel technological innovation.</p>\n<p>MiCA also mandates the recording of all sender and recipient information, regardless of the transaction amount. Against the backdrop of this emphasis on regulatory compliance, how will companies that operate with a focus on privacy operate?</p>\nStriking A Balance\n<p>Protocols must take a unique and innovative approach to ensure compliance with MiCA, with transactions conducted on their platform being private and secure but also auditable by the concerned authorities. As such, it is important for protocols to strike a balance between user privacy and regulatory requirements. For example, Dusk encrypts the user key with an auditor key. This means only the auditor can decrypt it. Users can utilize zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the auditor key was used to encrypt the user key. This innovative approach ensures compliance by combining digital identity, privacy, and encryption.</p>\n<p>The new EU regulations are expected to considerably impact those protocols that do not have simultaneous privacy and auditability at the base layer. Protocols that are privacy-focused and do not feature built-in auditability will face considerable difficulties when it comes to gaining traction in the European Union. Many public and anonymous tokens will also face considerable challenges.</p>\nHow Dusk Is Ready To Comply With MiCA\n<p>Dusk believes that regulatory clarity is critical for the broader adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation rules by the European Union is a significant step towards achieving greater regulatory compliance and clarity in the crypto space. Through the combination of privacy and auditability, Dusk has put itself in the best position to comply with the new regulations.</p>\n<p>Dusk is also working on its European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) ambitions and is leveraging Citadel as the underlying technology, allowing the protocol in a much more favorable position when compared to other crypto companies. Dusk uses privacy, a digital identity solution, two custom-made transaction models, and a proxied license to be compliant.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whale-10-total-shib-supply-shocks-market/",
    "description": "In a jaw-dropping discovery that has sent shockwaves through the Shiba Inu community, a dormant whale has emerged from hibernation. This anonymous early investor, who holds a staggering 10.15% of the total SHIB supply, has recently made significant moves, causing speculation within the community. The whale, identified by his address &#8220;0x140&#8221;, has been dormant for a staggering 157 days, but has now reawakened with a series of unprecedented transactions. In a span of just 24 hours, the whale distributed a whopping 4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to a staggering $30 million, across nine new wallets. Detailed data from Etherscan confirms the veracity of the whale&#8217;s recent movement. The whale distributed precisely 4,000,000,000,107 SHIB tokens across nine new wallets within a 24-hour period. The transfers began with a small amount of 107 SHIB to a specific address, followed by subsequent transfers of 500,000,000,000 SHIB each to eight separate addresses. Shiba Inu Whale Provides A Shock This unexpected flurry of activity has captured the attention of analysts and on-chain experts. Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analytics expert, noted that this whale is likely the largest holder of SHIB, with a current holding of 101.47 trillion SHIB tokens, worth an astonishing $756 million. Furthermore, this early investor has a total of 23 wallets where the SHIB holdings are distributed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Market Cap Climbs By $500 Million – Is A Price Rally On The Horizon? This colossal whale&#8217;s involvement in the SHIB ecosystem dates back to its early days. Spot On Chain, an on-chain analyst, revealed that the whale initially acquired a staggering 103.33T SHIB with a mere 38 ETH ($14,000) during its inception. Riding the wave of SHIB&#8217;s meteoric rise, this investment once reached a staggering valuation of $8.16 billion. In 2021, during the infamous SHIB price pump, the whale made strategic moves, reaping significant profits. Spot On Chain revealed that the whale exchanged approximately 1.9 trillion SHIB across various platforms, including Binance, Coinbase, and MEXC, at an average price of $0.00000969 in July 2021. This savvy maneuver resulted in an estimated profit of $18.49 million. Notably, the whale also executed a substantial sale of 603 billion SHIB tokens for 2,411 ETH, equivalent to $9.6 million at the time. Additionally, the whale deposited a staggering 1.25 trillion SHIB, worth $8.77 million, into Coinbase during the same year. SHIB Breakout Not Confirmed Yet The recent flurry of activity by this influential whale has left the SHIB community speculating about the intentions behind these transactions. With the distribution of such a massive amount of SHIB tokens, there are growing concerns and uncertainties among SHIB proponents. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? As the market keeps a keen eye on this whale&#8217;s next moves, it is evident that the impact of this early investor cannot be underestimated. Holding 10% of the total SHIB supply, this whale wields significant influence over the market and has the potential to trigger substantial fluctuations in SHIB&#8217;s price. At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00000752. The breakout from the downward trend (yellow circle) that has been in place since the beginning of February has thus still not been confirmed. Also, the longer the price does not make a decisive move towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000083, the more likely it becomes that the SHIB price will remain in bearish territory.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-price-drops-more-than-60-from-ath-what-lies-ahead/",
    "description": "The price of PEPE coin has experienced a significant decline, plummeting over 60% since reaching its peak on May 5. This substantial downturn has dealt a heavy blow to optimistic investors who were aiming to capitalize on their impressive triple-digit profits from June.  The latest insights from on-chain data suggest massive whale movement. In light of these developments, a pressing question arises: What lies ahead for the PEPE price, and what can be expected in the future? Trader Accumulates PEPE: A Long-Term Investment? Amidst the crypto community&#8217;s ongoing speculation, Lookonchain recently unveiled a noteworthy transaction involving trader &#8220;osf_rekt.&#8221; It appeared as though osf_rekt was making a conscious effort to maintain ownership of the assets as the user traded 141 Ethereum (ETH) for a staggering 173 billion units of the popular meme coin, PEPE. We noticed that @osf_rekt spent 141 $ETH ($265K) to buy 173B $PEPE again 16 hrs ago and transferred 690B $PEPE($1.05M) to a safe multisig wallet. He spent a total of 536 $ETH ($1.04M) to buy 613B $PEPE from June 14 to July 11, with an average buying price of $0.00000169. pic.twitter.com/jDzdf0JVvu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 12, 2023 What makes this transaction even more intriguing is that it was not the first instance of osf_rekt acquiring PEPE. This pattern of behavior by the trader using a pseudonym implies, in most cases, that they have a fundamental view that the cryptocurrency has positive prospects. Considering the widespread buzz surrounding PEPE, this accumulation of tokens by osf_rekt does not come as a surprise. However, it is worth noting that PEPE has experienced a recent decline in value. Over the past seven days alone, its value has depreciated by 14.7%, with a 24-hour slump of 2.8%, ultimately placing its current price at $0.00000150, as reported by CoinGecko. Source: Coingecko Declining User Adoption And Network Growth In addition, a PEPE price report notes that the meme coin has witnessed a concerning trend of dwindling user adoption. This is evident from the data provided by Santiment, which highlights a substantial decrease in the number of new users joining the PEPE network over the course of one week.  Source: Santiment Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price?

Chart: TradingView.com The decline in new user sign-ups is not the only cause for worry within the PEPE ecosystem. Another key metric, network growth, has also experienced a disappointing downturn. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Market Cap Climbs By $500 Million – Is A Price Rally On The Horizon? These figures raise concerns about the overall health and vitality of the PEPE ecosystem.
