Alibaba said these two models are small-size versions of the Tongyi Qiawen, which <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tech-giant-alibaba-to-roll-out-chatgpt-competitor-ai\">the company released in April</a>. </p><p>The new models aim to help introduce AI to the operations of small and medium-sized businesses. </p><p>The company said Qwen-7B and Qwen-7B-Chat have various capabilities that would be appealing to enterprises, such as being able to “code, model weights, and documentation will be freely accessible to academics, researchers and commercial institutions worldwide.”</p><p>Alibaba’s latest LLMs are also the first released from a Chinese tech company to be open-sourced. However, it said businesses with over 100 million monthly active users will need a license. </p><p>On Aug. 1, the company also announced an update in the form of a vector engine to its AnalyticDB data warehousing service, allowing its corporate clients to quickly create custom generative AI applications.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-chip-developer-gets-100-million-from-samsung-and-hyundai\"><strong><em>AI chip developer gets $100 million from Samsung and Hyundai</em></strong></a></p><p>This development comes after <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/llama-2-open-source-ai-model-launched-by-meta-microsoft\">Meta released its open-sourced LLM</a> — Llama 2 — with Microsoft on July 16. </p><p>Meta says its Llama 2 was trained using 40% more public data and can process twice as much context as its predecessor.

These tokens could then be used for voting rights on the Curve platform where Curve users would be able to use it to provide liquidity for token pairs that involve GHO.</p><blockquote>“The treasury balance and the predicted lower costs for service providers for the 2023-2024 budget would allow this strategic acquisition while maintaining a conservative stance with DAO treasury holdings,\" the proposal noted.</blockquote><p>The proposal garnered mixed reactions from the Aave community where some claimed that the DeFi protocol should look for ways to reduce its exposure to the risk of CRV liquidation while adding:</p><blockquote>“This is a joke and goes against the best interest of both Aave stakeholders and Aave lenders, just to help a user who took too much leverage. How is this decentralized finance?”</blockquote><p>A few others lauded the proposal claiming it would help the protocol to de-risk the current CRV over leverage and also help the GHO stablecoin growth.</p><p>Separately, Huobi's co-founder Jun Du also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-huobi-s-jun-du-acquires-10-million-crv-tokens-to-support-curve\">purchased 10 million CRV tokens</a> for $4 million from Curve Finance founder.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-million-dollar-mev-block-reward-amid-curve-finance-exploit\"><strong><em>Ethereum logs $1M MEV block reward amid Curve Finance exploit</em></strong></a></p><p>Michael Egorov, the Curve founder, has total <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-finance-founder-100-million-debt-could-trigger-defi-implosion\">outstanding loans of over $100 million</a> from various lending protocols. Out of this $70 million loan in USDT is on Aave v2, using CRV as collateral. Aave's risk parameters state that CRV will be at risk of liquidation if its price falls to around $0.32. </p><p>CRV is currently trading at $0.59 and a price decline of nearly 60% would lead to liquidation. In this case, the borrower's deeded collateral will be liquidated to pay back the borrowed asset. This means that CRV will be sold for USDT, resulting in bad debt.</p><p>Egorov has been on a CRV selling spree to manage his multi-million loan positions. Ever since the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-finance-pools-exploited-over-24-reentrancy-vulnerability\">exploit on the Curve protocol</a>, its founder has sold millions worth of CRV tokens through over-the-counter trades.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ethics-101-crypto-projects-negotiate-hackers/\"><strong><em>Should crypto projects ever negotiate with hackers?
