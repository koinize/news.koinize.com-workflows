    "description": "The CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, Samson Mow, has once again reiterated his ultra-bullish prediction for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin advocate noted that the ‘Max Pain Theory’ was still in play, and this is one of the reasons why he isn’t backing down from his assertion that Bitcoin will hit this price level sooner rather than later.  Bitcoin’s Rise To $1 Million To Happen “In Days To Weeks” Samson Mow stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that his “main prediction” is that Bitcoin’s run to $1 million will happen in “days to weeks.” However, he further claimed that the starting point for this meteoric rise has yet to be decided.  Related Reading: Solana Is Not Done: Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Will Trigger Massive Rally Above $150 The analyst’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin stems from his belief in the max pain theory, which relates to a Bitcoin price that could cause most options traders to experience maximum loss. In Mow’s opinion, Bitcoin bulls have experienced this loss following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the bears could experience “some pain soon.” Right before the approval order came in, Mow had predicted that Bitcoin was going to surge to $1 million in “days to weeks” and that most people were going to experience “max pain.” These ETFs also form part of the basis for why he believes that Bitcoin will hit this price level soon enough, as Mow foresees a huge demand for btc following this. Mow says that the Bitcoin market is getting to a point where the existing supply will not meet current demand. He also alluded to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, hinting that it could be one of the catalysts that will spark this parabolic rise in Bitcoin’s price. Interestingly, he had before now mentioned that Bitcoin will hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving event takes place.  BTC bulls struggle to reclaim control &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com A Market Adjustment Is Currently Ongoing Mow also gave his opinion on the reason for Bitcoin’s recent decline as he noted that the market was simply adjusting. He further explained that GBTC holders were currently rotating out, which was pushing Bitcoin’s price down. He also alluded to how MicroStrategy’s stock was “trading below BTC par value.” Related Reading: How To Buy And Trade Tokens On The SEI Network Therefore, the crypto community needs to be patient as “time is needed for everything to recalibrate,” Mow says. It shouldn’t be long for that to happen, though, as the crypto analyst claimed that the GBTC sell pressure “won’t be a long drawn out process.”  He believes that many of GBTC’s investors won’t be able to offload their stocks because the “tax hit is too big” and that Grayscale will eventually capitulate on its fees. The asset manager currently has the largest fee among all Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, and this is believed to be the reason why its investors are offloading their shares and rotating to other funds.  Featured image from Bitcoin News, chart from Tradingview.com"
