Vilfredo Pareto, an economist from Italy, observed that 20% of the population in Italy controlled 80% of the country’s land at the beginning of the 20th century. </p><p>Since then, this principle has been employed in many different sectors over the years and is frequently invoked to highlight the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-will-eventually-replace-fiat-but-how-soon-and-where\">uneven distribution of results</a>. But what does the 80/20 rule mean for blockchain technology?</p><p>In the context of cryptocurrencies, the Pareto principle can be observed in several ways:</p><h3>Blockchain network security</h3><p>A small percentage of nodes — usually around 20% — carry the bulk of the computational workload for network security, safeguarding the integrity and safety of the whole blockchain network. These nodes, which are frequently run by significant entities, contribute disproportionately to preserving the stability of the network.</p><h3>Wealth distribution</h3><p>A small percentage of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/17-of-addresses-snapped-up-80-of-all-ethereum-nfts-since-april\">wallet addresses possess the vast majority of the coins</a> for several cryptocurrencies. This <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-crypto-whale-trackers-and-how-do-they-work\">small group of investors</a>, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly influence the market due to their substantial holdings. The 80/20 rule is in line with this wealth concentration.</p><h3>Project success</h3><p>The vast majority of investor interest and investment in the realm of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/initial-coin-offering\">initial coin offerings (ICOs)</a> and token launches goes to a relatively small number of projects. The 80/20 rule of success is a result of investors concentrating their capital on businesses with strong teams, original concepts and promising technologies.</p><h3>Smart contracts usage</h3><p>The majority of cutting-edge and widely adopted applications are created by a small group of developers and users on blockchain platforms like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements\">Ethereum that support smart contracts</a>. This small cohort of people and businesses makes a substantial contribution to the creation and application of smart contracts, influencing the development of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know\">blockchain technology</a> as a whole. </p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-118493-3\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Ethical concerns related to the concentration of wealth in the crypto space            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>Due to its propensity to encourage market manipulation, prolong inequality, restrict financial inclusion, and amplify environmental problems, the concentration of wealth in the cryptocurrency field poses ethical questions. </em></p><p>Significant ethical questions are raised by the wealth concentration in the crypto industry, which reflects deeper socioeconomic problems. The unequal distribution of resources is one of the primary worries. The power imbalance that results from wealth concentration by whales undermines the decentralized spirit that cryptocurrencies want to promote while also perpetuating existing injustices.</p><p>Additionally, market manipulation may result from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/71-of-high-net-worth-individuals-have-invested-in-digital-assets-survey\">wealth concentration</a>. Due to their huge holdings, whales have the power to affect market prices, creating artificial volatility that hurts smaller investors. Moreover, the widespread concerns about insider trading, pump-and-dump schemes and other types of market manipulation erode confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>The digital divide is widened by the concentration of wealth in cryptocurrencies. Access to financial services, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications\">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and investment opportunities becomes increasingly important as blockchain technology develops. The democratizing potential of cryptocurrencies is constrained when wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, impeding financial inclusion and social advancement.</p><p>Another ethical issue is the effect on the environment. The mining of cryptocurrencies, especially in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained\">proof-of-work (PoW) systems</a>, needs a lot of processing power, which uses a lot of energy. When a small number of companies dominate most mining operations, the environmental cost increases, creating moral concerns about resource sustainability and efficient use of resources.</p><p>These ethical concerns may be addressed using a multifaceted approach. Some of these problems can be mitigated by promoting wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies, increasing transaction transparency, and other measures. Additionally, developing a more inclusive crypto environment in line with ethical ideals can be achieved by supporting and promoting <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance\">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> initiatives that strive to build more egalitarian financial systems.</p><p>Economic and financial institutions known as egalitarian financial systems work to close or eliminate wealth, income and opportunity gaps by promoting equality and fairness among people or groups. In such systems, regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender or any other criteria, every participant is treated equally in terms of access to financial resources, economic possibilities and fundamental services.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-118493-2\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                The impact of governance structures on cryptocurrencies: A Pareto perspective            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>The 80/20 rule, which states that decisions are frequently significantly influenced by a small fraction of participants, can be used to examine the Pareto effect of governance structures on cryptocurrencies. </em></p><p>The Pareto principle affects cryptocurrency governance structures in the following ways:</p><h3>Decision-making power concentration: 20% influence, 80% decisions</h3><p>A considerable amount of the overall supply (about 20%) is frequently controlled by a very small number of major investors, early adopters or powerful institutions in many cryptocurrency networks. These organizations have a disproportionate amount of influence (about 80%) over governance choices as a result of their significant holdings. They have the power to influence decisions about proposals, votes and protocol updates in ways that benefit them.</p><h3>Voting and proposal systems: 20% active participants, 80% votes</h3><p>Only about 20% of tokenholders (on average) actively <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X23000568\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">participate</a> in governance mechanisms like voting and proposal systems. But typically, these 20% of participants cast around 80% of the total votes. As a result, this active minority has a significant impact on decisions.</p><h3>Impact on upgrades and development: 20% funding, 80% development</h3><p>When cryptocurrencies use funding methods such as treasuries or development grants, only a few businesses or projects (about 20%) may receive the majority (nearly 80%) of the funding. Because of this, these well-funded projects have a bigger influence on the advancement and development of cryptocurrency.</p><h3>Governance token distribution: 20% holders, 80% influence</h3><p>A small percentage of tokenholders (about 20%) frequently control the majority of the tokens (around 80%) in systems that use <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-governance-tokens-and-how-do-they-work\">governance tokens</a>. As a result, these holders have a significant influence over decisions and proposals, which has an effect on the cryptocurrency’s general course.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-118493-1\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Cryptocurrency investment strategies based on the Pareto 80/20 rule            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>Investors can better control their risk and increase their potential for sustained gain by adhering to the 80/20 rule as they traverse the complex crypto ecosystem.</em></p><p>Leveraging the Pareto principle may help direct a strategic and focused approach for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-the-ultimate-beginners-guide\">crypto investors</a>. Investors can focus their resources on the top 20% of reputable and influential cryptocurrencies rather than dispersing their investments across a large number of digital assets.</p><p>This strategic focus enables a greater comprehension of the key market participants, empowering investors to make wise choices based on in-depth investigation and analysis. Investors can take advantage of these established assets’ stability and market dominance by devoting the majority of their investment portfolio to these significant cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Furthermore, the 80/20 rule can extend to the investment timeline. Investors might consider adopting a long-term perspective and allocating 80% of their capital to established cryptocurrencies designed for long-term ownership. </p><p>This strategy is in line with the idea that the key to steady, long-term growth is to concentrate on the most valuable assets. The remaining 20% of the portfolio can be used for short- or medium-term transactions, allowing investors to take advantage of market volatility for more rapid gains.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-118493-0\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                How to mitigate the negative impact of the 80/20 rule on cryptocurrencies            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>To reduce the Pareto principle’s unfavorable effects on the crypto industry, fairness, accessibility and inclusivity must be actively promoted.</em></p><p>Projects should concentrate on putting equal-opportunity policies into action to combat the concentration of wealth and power.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-blackrock-jpmorgan/",
    "description": "Amid the struggles in the cryptocurrency market, recent reports have suggested that the world&#8217;s largest asset manager Blackrock, and financial giant JPMorgan might spark a massive bull run for the XRP price as they work simultaneously. Blackrock, JPMorgan Move Might Affect XRP Price According to the report, Forbes Senior Contributor, Billy Bambrough, highlighted that Blackrock and JPMorgan are purportedly laying the foundation for an impending surge in the cryptocurrency sector. The report further identified several collaborative cryptocurrency moves taken by the two financial powerhouse firms. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire Bambrough pointed out a recent report that claims that the asset manager recently utilized JPMorgan&#8217;s Ethereum-based Onyx network and tokenized collateral service.  Blackrock reportedly used the network to tokenize shares from one of its financial market funds, which was later transferred to the London-based Barclays in an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative operations occur between two parties. However,  the specifics of the order quantity, cost, and other information of Blockrock&#8217;s transactions with Barclays remain concealed from the public. Following the report by Bambrough, it was revealed that Blackrock became the first Wall Street giant to make use of JPMorgan&#8217;s blockchain-based collateral settlement system. This was part of a move that Blackrock&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, has stated will pave the way for the &#8220;next generation for markets.&#8221; The Blackrock CEO&#8217;s previous statement in an annual letter to shareholders where he emphasized blockchain technology as “very important” in the past year was also mentioned in the report. Fink highlighted the role that blockchain technology plays in their financial operations. Blockchain technology enables traditional assets to be &#8220;tokenized&#8221; on a public ledger, potentially simplifying and lowering the cost of transferring anything from stocks and bonds to real estate and alternative investments like art. Due to this, Billy Bambrough believes that there will be a significant increase in the price of digital assets such as XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) as a result of BlackRock and JPMorgan entering the cryptocurrency industry, considering their connections to the traditional market. In addition, Ripple is also aiming to establish the XRP Ledger as a crucial platform for the tokenization of real-world assets. BlackRock using XRP would not doubt have an immense impact on the XRP price. An example of the kind of rally it could trigger is what happened back in June with Bitcoin when the asset manager announced it had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Significance Of Blackrock&#8217;s Transaction Via JPMorgan Blockchain So far, Blackrock&#8217;s partnering with JPMorgan marks a new milestone for the financial firm. Blackrock&#8217;s recent transaction via JPMorgan&#8217;s blockchain indicates a crucial contribution to the volume of the Ethereum-based network Onyx. Related Reading: Ripple Job Posting Sparks IPO Rumors, Will XRP Price Finally Cross $100? Additionally, the operation could unveil a new world of possibilities for established financial institutions which enables them to free up capital and boost efficiency across separate markets, as a spokesman from JPMorgan told Bloomberg. JPMorgan&#8217;s Head of Trading Service Ed Bond, also stated that &#8220;institutions on the network can use a wider scope of assets to meet any collateral requirements they have on the back of trading.&#8221; XRP price settles above $0.48 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Binance, chart from Tradingview.com"
