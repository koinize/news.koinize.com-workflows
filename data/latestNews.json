    "description": "<p>After two months of slow sideways and downward price movement, bitcoin has suddenly broken the trend, giving control back to the bulls.</p>\nMany investors had fled\n<p>Following on from the mass of negativity caused by the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s attack on the crypto industry culminating in suing the two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, most investors had fled the scene, possibly thinking that crypto might die.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in a Crypto Daily article published only two days previously, it is times like these that the intelligent and experienced traders are waiting for. In addition, the technicals were looking quite positive.</p>\nTechnicals looking good\n<p>Bitcoin had been traversing in a downward sloping channel since mid-April (a bullish pattern in itself), which could even be taken as a bull flag that had gone on for rather a long time.</p>\n<p>Had bitcoin fallen out of the bottom of the channel instead, then this would have been seen as extremely bearish. However, bitcoin did the most logical thing and broke out strongly to the upside.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is currently playing with $29,000, which it did hit earlier today. There is the possibility that the price could storm on to the major resistance at $30,300, but it could be expected to get rejected here, at least for the time being.</p>\nCan the move be sustained?\n<p>It might be wondered if bitcoin will be able to sustain a sizable rally on the scale of the 4 and a half month one it made from the beginning of the year. There is still much fear and negativity permeating the crypto space, and given the SEC actions, liquidity is very thin.</p>\n<p>However, bitcoin has its halving cycle that will be drawing the king of the crypto assets higher. This is due to take place in April 2024, so still a lot of ups and downs before the bull run can start in earnest.</p>\nNothing comes close\n<p>All does appear to be on track though. Bitcoin is still the scarcest and hardest form of money on the planet, and it is only a matter of time before traditional institutions take off the blinkers and do something about protecting their portfolios with bitcoin - Gensler and his SEC permitting of course.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Welcome to an exciting exploration of crypto passive income ideas! Crypto passive income refers to the ability to earn money from your cryptocurrency investments without actively trading or constantly monitoring the market.

In this article, we will delve into the world of three high-potential coins: Ethereum (ETH), TENET (TENET), and the trailblazing Caged Beasts (BEASTS). Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique opportunities for generating passive income and shaking up the crypto landscape.</p>\n<p>Ethereum - Liquid Staking With The Alt King!Ethereum (ETH), the king of smart contract platforms, needs no introduction. It has revolutionized the crypto space, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and launch their own tokens with ease. Compared to other crypto projects, Ethereum boasts unique strengths such as a robust ecosystem, widespread adoption, and the ability to execute complex smart contracts efficiently.</p>\n<p>But what about liquid staking on Ethereum? Liquid staking combines the benefits of staking and liquidity, allowing users to stake their Ethereum while still having the flexibility to trade or use their staked assets. By utilizing platforms like Lido, users can seamlessly stake and unstake their ETH, earning lucrative yields while enjoying the freedom to access their assets at any time. This innovative approach to staking offers the best of both worlds and is a game-changer for passive income seekers.</p>\n<p>TENET - The LSD-Driven Blockchain</p>\n<p>Now, let's dive into the world of TENET (TENET), a more recent crypto gem that has emerged. Layer-1 blockchain Tenet has partnered with omnichain messaging protocol LayerZero to plug into a cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This collaboration grants Tenet access to the wider DeFi landscape across multiple blockchains.</p>\n<p>TENET's DeFi-focused ecosystem provides liquidity and yield products for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Similar to Ethereum's liquid staking pools, such as Lido, TENET's network enables users to stake and unstake assets seamlessly, unlocking the potential for lucrative yields. Moreover, TENET allows users to create projects and tokens, integrating them with LayerZero technology for enhanced interoperability across various smart contract blockchains. By leveraging this ecosystem, TENET empowers PoS native tokens to maximize their earnings potential, showcasing the power of LSDs in the DeFi space.</p>\n<p>Caged Beasts - Defying Convention with Memetic Brilliance! </p>\n<p>This article wouldn't be complete without a meme coin, and Caged Beasts (BEASTS) steals the spotlight. The proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is used to govern this decentralized Ethereum-based meme coin, assuring a robust and beneficial investment potential.
