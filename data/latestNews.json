In it, the lead developer Diyahir Campos proposed a standard for a DeFi “circuit breaker.” It essentially aims to set a standard for a smart contract with the ability to halt suspiciously large token outflows from a DeFi protocol.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ Announcing ERC 7265: Circuit Breaker<br><br>We are fixing the biggest problem with DeFi Security - lack of response time to mitigate hacks.<br><br>Built by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Diyahir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Diyahir</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tcb_00?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tcb_00</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/real_philogy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@real_philogy</a><a href=\"https://t.co/4KQDYEK2H7\">https://t.co/4KQDYEK2H7</a></p>&mdash; Meir Bank (@MeirBank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeirBank/status/1675851684386570240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Last year was the single <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-exploits-and-access-control-hacks-cost-crypto-investors-billions-in-2022-report\">biggest year for crypto hacks</a>, with at least $3.1 billion stolen from DeFi protocols, 65% of that coming out of cross-chain bridges. </p><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, Campos said circuit breakers could have prevented billions in losses. </p><blockquote>“The ones that weren’t rugs, you could probably save 70% of the money [...] with minimal impact to users.” </blockquote><p>Campos revealed he was one of the many that lost funds in the $195 million Euler Finance attack in March, which <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/euler-finance-attack-how-it-happened-and-what-can-be-learned\">led to contagion</a> that impacted 11 other protocols. </p><p>“Actually, I was one of the depositors in the Euler hack,” he said.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/ Our data analysis shows that DeFi Guardian could have saved more than 50% of losses from the recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eulerfinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@eulerfinance</a> hack.<br><br>Instead of draining the entire TVL of Euler within moments, the Euler hacker would have been rate limited, saving tens of millions of dollars for users. <a href=\"https://t.co/Nuck06iQIo\">pic.twitter.com/Nuck06iQIo</a></p>&mdash; Meir Bank (@MeirBank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeirBank/status/1664260680969781248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>“From that experience, I’m looking at the TVL charts and the transactions that happened and really it begged the question:”</p><blockquote>“Why would you ever let 100% of your TVL leave in 10 seconds or five blocks?”</blockquote><p>A typical DeFi protocol would see around 20% of total value locked entering or leaving a project in a day. </p><p>“Once you start talking 30% or 40%, that's when you really start separating exploits versus daily usage,” said Campos. </p><p>The proposed standard has not been without controversy. DeFi researcher Chris Blec was among the skeptics on Twitter concerned the circuit breaker could be used for potentially nefarious purposes. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh dear Lord.

He noted the circuit breaker would be an “opt-in thing” for DeFi projects. </p><p>He also believes that a well-designed circuit breaker will need to strike a balance between protecting users and preventing “false positives,” as it would be extremely disruptive whenever the breaker trips.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-mpc-bridge-sees-millions-in-outflows-exploit-feared\"><strong><em>Multichain MPC bridge sees $100M+ outflows, sparking fears of exploit</em></strong></a></p><p>However a circuit breaker would be useless in cases of internal rug pulls, as it could simply be deactivated by the team controlling the protocol. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A quick exploration of the power of circuit breakers in DeFi and their limitations in preventing costly hacks <a href=\"https://t.co/bZKeWJyUkI\">https://t.co/bZKeWJyUkI</a></p>&mdash; Diyahir (@Diyahir) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Diyahir/status/1673540573586915330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Campos is a smart contract developer at Hydrogen Labs.
