The items are being offered as part of a partnership between online art store Avante Art and CryptoPunks brand owner Yuga Labs. The sale will last for only 48 hours. It began on October 26 at 3:00 p.m. UTC and will end on October 28 at 3:00 p.m. UTC.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our print collaboration with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avant_arte?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@avant_arte</a> is officially live – for 48 hours only.<br><br>Punk On-Chain is available exclusively to CryptoPunk holders at <a href=\"https://t.co/skT1FKTJgB\">https://t.co/skT1FKTJgB</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/X657IqdgUT\">pic.twitter.com/X657IqdgUT</a></p>&mdash; CryptoPunks (@cryptopunksnfts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1717541741513920632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Two different versions of the physical CryptoPunks collection are being offered on Avante Art. The first is called “Punk-On-Chain.” Each punk owner can commission a Punk-on-Chain print copy for each digital punk they own. However, users will need to prove ownership to commission a print copy. This means that individuals who do not own the on-chain version cannot buy its print version.</p><p>The second collection is called “10,000 On-Chain,” which is a print collection of all 10,000 CryptoPunks that's open to anyone. Collectors can buy the print version of a 10,000 On-Chain punk even if they don’t own the original on-chain version.</p><p>The two different versions of each printed punk are distinguishable from each other by a variety of characteristics. For example, the 10,000 On-Chain pieces are Archival pigment prints with silkscreen varnish seal, whereas the Punks-On-Chain pieces are UV pigment prints with white underpins. Both versions of each punk contain a Yuga Labs holographic sticker to prove their authenticity. </p><p>The Punks-On-Chain items also feature a QR code on the back of the print, leading to a blockchain-based digital Certificate of Authenticity (CoA). As for the 10,000 On-Chain pieces, they ship with a physical CoA that contains a QR code leading to the digital CoA, but this QR code is not on the print itself.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/yuga-completes-restructuring-otherside\"><strong>BAYC creator Yuga Labs completes restructuring to focus on metaverse</strong></a></em></p><p>CryptoPunks was one of the first algorithmically generated art collections to be distributed through blockchain technology.
