There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below the $0.5720 support. XRP Price Faces Uphill Task After a steady decline, XRP price found support near the $0.5720 level. A low was formed at $0.5714 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.5880 and $0.600 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5714 low.

A close above the $0.6580 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.700. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.700 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.7440 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.800 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.640 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.600 zone. The next major support is at $0.5720. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5720 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.5250 support zone. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-flag-predict-10-77000-analyst/",
    "description": "An analyst has explained that a breakout from a bull flag pattern could lead Bitcoin to surging towards a new all-time high of $77,000. Bitcoin Has Been Forming A Bull Flag Pattern Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a bull flag recently forming in the 4-hour price of the cryptocurrency. The &#8220;bull flag&#8221; here refers to a pattern in technical analysis that, as its name implies, looks like a flag on a pole. In this pattern, a sharp uptrend is succeeded by a period of consolidation towards the downside. The uptrend makes up for the pole, while the consolidation period acts as the flag. Related Reading: Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes When the price is trapped inside the flag, it tends to find resistance at its upper line, so tops may be probable to form there. Similarly, the lower line may act as support, thus facilitating for bottoms to take shape. The bull flag is usually considered to be a continuation pattern, meaning that the prevailing trend (that is, the trend of the flag) would continue once the consolidation period is over. This happens when a break above the resistance line takes place. The uptrend emerging out of such a break may be of the same height as the pole. If the asset falls under the support line, though, the pattern could be considered invalidated. Like the bull flag, there is also the bear flag pattern, which works similarly except for the fact that the pole in this case corresponds to a downtrend while the flag is generally a consolidation channel angled upwards. Just like the bull flag, a continuation of the prevailing bearish trend may follow this formation. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the bull flag that BTC&#8217;s 4-hour price has recently been consolidating inside: Looks like the price of the asset has been breaking out of this pattern recently &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the 4-hour Bitcoin price has appeared to have been consolidating inside this bull flag over the last few days. It&#8217;s also apparent that, in the past day, BTC has been climbing above the resistance line of the pattern. This could mean that the cryptocurrency is preparing a break out of this formation. Naturally, the asset would have to show more momentum before the breakout can be confirmed.

The analyst has chosen this target as such a swing would be of the same length as the pole that had preceded this flag. BTC Price Bitcoin has so far been heading in a direction that would add more credence to the breakout, as its price has now broken past the $71,300 level. With this surge, BTC investors would be enjoying profits of more than 7% over the past week. The price of the asset appears to have surged over the past 24 hours &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-going-to-0-0001/",
    "description": "Shiba Inu has gone on various price spikes in the past few months amidst a surge in activity and interest in the meme coin. This price movement has prompted traders and analysts to ponder on when SHIB can reach the much coveted $0.0001 mark, a price level which it has largely failed to reach despite the impressive price action.  Micheal_EWPro, a crypto analyst, posted an analysis on when SHIB could potentially reach the $0.0001 price level. According to him, the current dynamics could push SHIB above $0.0001 in June. Interestingly, his price prediction is based on the Elliott Wave Theory. Analyst Reveals SHIB Is Going To $0.0001 According to the SHIB chart shared by Michael on the 3-day candlestick formation, the meme coin&#8217;s price formation since 2022 has largely followed the Elliott Wave count. The Elliot Wave Theory is basically a technical analysis method that analyses price movement traditionally in terms of a 5-wave move in the direction of the larger trend and a 3-wave correction in the opposite trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Pre-Bull Rally Phase: Crypto Analyst Reveals Next Target Each of these Elliott Wave can be further subdivided into various patterns of smaller degree impulses based on their formations. However, all the subdivisions add up to one larger wave impulse. Using this knowledge of Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst noted that SHIB has started the formation of the third of five larger degree waves since October 2023 albeit with smaller degree impulses which he labelled as i, ii, iii, iv, and v. Traditionally, the third Elliot Wave is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend where most of the price action takes place. As a result, his analysis points to the third wave ending at a price just above $0.0001 in the first week of June. The analyst did implore a take-profit at $0.00008854 and a final price target of $0.00010191, while also noting that the bulls still have some work to do before this price point can come to a reality.  $SHIB bulls got a little work to do here on 3D but after that I think it sends to my sub 5 TP pic.twitter.com/YQLQqw8bxH — BigMike7335 (@Michael_EWpro) March 24, 2024 What’s Next For Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu has reversed since reaching $0.00004456 and has majorly traded between $0.000030 and $0.0000275 since the beginning of the week. However, analysts and SHIB enthusiasts remain positive, especially with SHIB securing a listing on an Australian-based crypto exchange.

    "description": "Floki Inu (FLOKI) performed stellarly this month, with crypto analysts and traders forecasting bullish moves for the token. As the crypto market recovers from its slowdown, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the way, the dog-themed token appears to be preparing to take off. Related Reading: Dogecoin Soars 17% To Break $0.21 As Volume Explodes Analysts Share Bullish Forecasts For FLOKI’s Future Two weeks ago, analysts considered that FLOKI was showing a strong performance amid the crypto market slowdown. The token, which has been on an upward trajectory since the end of February, “held up nicely” at the time. While most of the market registered considerable dips, FLOKI was one of the tokens “consolidating before another expansion.” Halfway through the month, the Viking dog-themed cryptocurrency had shown a 337% growth since March 1st, after hovering between $0.000028-$0.000039 for the first two months of 2024. Now that March is near its end, FLOKI exhibits a staggering 428.3% increase in the last 30 days. This performance didn’t go unnoticed by crypto analysts, who forecast new heights for the token. MacroCRG, a crypto trader and market analyst, shared his thoughts on the token’s price. The analyst considers that beyond FLOKI’s impressive performance throughout the month, it was “showing strength on LTF&#8217;s too.” $DOGE leading the charge, just hit a fresh 121 week high This is wildly bullish for other blue chip memes$FLOKI showing strength on LTF&#39;s too As long as this recent low holds, fresh highs soon IMO pic.twitter.com/cmPn89x7a7 &#8212; CRG (@MacroCRG) March 28, 2024 In the post’s chart, the trader highlighted the performance since Monday, pointing out the token’s support zone above the $0.00022 price range. According to MacroCRG, “as long as this recent low holds, fresh highs soon.” Similarly to MacroCRG, analyst Crypto Kaleo drew attention to the dog-themed token’s LFT, claiming it looks like it’s “starting to send.” Something like this for $FLOKI pic.twitter.com/dEUa9pBUvi &#8212; K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) March 28, 2024 In his posts, Kaleo suggested to his followers “not to sleep on FLOKI here.” According to the analyst, the token won’t be “lagging behind ATH resistance too much longer.”  He concluded that sooner rather than later, FLOKI could make new heights “like the DOGE chart.” Lastly, crypto analyst The CryptoBull shared his bullish prediction about the token, suggesting it is going through a “beautiful re-accumulation phase.” Additionally, the analyst stated he noticed a shift in interest for the dog-themed memecoin, as “crypto is very momentum driven.” FLOKI Price Action As of this writing, FLOKI has surged 7.7 % in the past hour, with the price briefly surpassing the $0.000260 mark before retracing to the $0.000255 level. In the last 24 hours, the token has increased 9.8%, trading at $0.0002554. Despite the remarkable long-term performance and the recent surge, the token is still registering a 10.6% correction from its performance in the biweekly timeframe. Its market capitalization rose to $2.39 billion, an 8.4% surge in the past day. By this metric, FLOKI is the fifth largest memecoin and the 56th largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap data. Moreover, the daily trading volume suggests that the token has recently experienced a surge in market activity. It has increased 56.6% from the day before, with $690.6 million traded.
