Consequently, this approach has raised concerns, particularly in light of the potential infringement on the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.</p><p>The context of this legal challenge <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/cases/administrative-law-and-government-litigation/sec-v-jarkesy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">centers</a> around the SEC v. Jarkesy case. In this specific case, George Jarkesy contends that his Seventh Amendment rights were violated. He argues that the SEC's internal adjudication process, which lacks a jury and is overseen by an administrative law judge appointed by the commission, contradicts these rights. This effectively results in a single entity fulfilling the roles of judge, jury and enforcer.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/d8357bd8-3c64-4be9-8a80-c68abaa95091.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of the Amicus Brief       Source: ICAN Law</em></figcaption></figure><p>Musk and Cuban pointed out a notable shift in the SEC's approach between 2013 and 2014. They observed that the SEC started handling a greater number of cases internally rather than through federal courts. This change occurred after a string of unsuccessful insider trading cases tried before juries. </p><p>Musk is facing his third notable <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-scorns-sec-doj-lawsuit-twitter-purchase\">legal dispute with the financial regulatory agency</a>. This comes in the wake of prior lawsuits in 2018 and 2019. Currently, the regulatory body is pursuing the involvement of a federal court to request Musk's testimony regarding his acquisition of Twitter, with a specific focus on his public statements about the transaction, as disclosed in legal records.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-trials-1-subscription-signup-fee-new-x-users-new-zealand-philippines\"><strong><em>Elon Musk trials $1 subscription signup fee for new X users in New Zealand, Philippines</em></strong></a></p><p>Nonetheless, Musk and Cuban maintain a steadfast position. They are appealing to the justices to endorse the decision made by the 5th Circuit. Their legal representatives contend that opting for administrative proceedings over the option of federal court juries runs counter to the SEC's stated mission. Furthermore, such decisions could have the potential to negatively impact both investors and the markets that the SEC is committed to protecting.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-regulation-sec-chair-gary-gensler-final-say/\"><strong><em>Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
