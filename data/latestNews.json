However, this phase was followed by a significant correction that caused prices to plummet, sending the cryptocurrency back to lower levels,” he wrote.</p><p>Wedson also suggested that should history repeat, sub-$20,000 levels could resurface. An accompanying chart offered a fractal, which could now be subject to a repeat.</p><p>“Now, in 2023, we are once again witnessing Bitcoin achieving over +100% in gains, attracting substantial interest from institutional and retail investors. Nevertheless, the market has recently experienced significant volatility and a downward price trend. This similarity to the past raises questions about whether we are witnessing a repeat of the previous cycle,” he continued.</p><blockquote>“The target is $19,500 USD if this fractal holds over the next few weeks, which could result in a series of FUD and negative news in the cryptocurrency space. Furthermore, there is the possibility of a redistribution, where the price threatens significant highs, but institutional profit-taking forces the price down, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the market.”</blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/18eebd45-d8b3-45f5-8071-048e3287c4fc.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD annotated chart with fractal (screenshot).
