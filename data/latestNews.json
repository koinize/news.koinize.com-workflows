A default judgment is a legal ruling issued by a court when one party in a lawsuit fails to respond or defend their case within the specified legal time frame.

This funding was intended for a software platform aimed at gig economy workers and companies. The SEC's contention is that the offers and sales of Thor Tokens were not registered with the SEC and were promoted as investment opportunities. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3072a836-dcb9-4177-89ec-d285b346a369.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of the final judgment             Source: SEC     </em></figcaption></figure><p>These funds were generated through the sale of the Thor (THOR) coin, with about 200 of these investors residing in the United States. The SEC accused Chin and Thor of violating federal securities laws by issuing and vending unregistered Thor Tokens without meeting the requirements for an exemption.</p><p>Furthermore, the SEC asserted that both Chin and Thor provided investors with inaccurate and deceptive information concerning the project's advancements, collaborations and income. In April 2019, following their<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/san-francisco-based-thor-token-project-shuts-down\"> announcement of halting operations</a> due to regulatory obstacles, Chin assured investors of repayment while devising a strategy.
