Is the SOL bull run finally over?</p>\n                    <p><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) is seeing a price correction after rallying nearly 300% in recent months.</p><h2>Why is Solana price down today?</h2><p>As of Nov. 21, SOL's price was trading for $55, down 20% when measured from its local high of $60.50 established just five days prior. The decline mirrors similar moves elsewhere in the crypto market, with top coins, Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), also down 2.2% and 5.5% from their local highs.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/4fc556be-435f-4fb2-a308-a0ddf3f73d5a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USD versus BTC/USD and ETH/USD year-to-date performance. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss the major reasons behind Solana's slump.</p><h3>SEC labels SOL a \"security\"</h3><p>Solana's price decline coincides with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) latest <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-kraken-for-securities-laws-violations\">lawsuit</a> against the Kraken crypto exchange. In its filings on Nov. 20, the watchdog accused Kraken of breaking securities laws.</p><p>While doing so, the SEC labeled a bunch of cryptocurrencies as securities, including Solana. SOL's price has declined 10.25% since.</p><p>Other tokens named in the SEC lawsuit fell similarly, including <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>, whose price decreased 5.5% after the Kraken news. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/09fffbc8-5e25-46e3-9fb8-83428fb3489f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USD 4H price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The SEC's potential designation of SOL as a security may affect its availability on U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges, similar to the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-price-falls-24-in-24-hours-as-exchanges-begin-delisting\">impact</a> seen with XRP.</p><h3>Overbought correction</h3><p>SOL's price drop today is part of an overbought correction that began after its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-3-ways-the-relative-strength-index-rsi-can-be-used-as-a-sell-signal\">daily relative strength index (RSI)</a> jumped above 70.</p><p>In addition, Solana's correction came after a period of growing divergence between its rising prices and falling RSI, indicating bullish exhaustion. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/c25f7bca-ef30-4089-b877-4269b1ea0530.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USD daily price chart ft. bearish divergence. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Over $6.5 million worth of longs liquidated</h3><p>Solana's decline further coincides with $6.5 million worth of long liquidations across its derivative markets since Nov. 20. In comparison, nearly $2 million worth of shorts were liquidated.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/32efb6c6-b371-4426-9b08-2ae10aa35ff0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL total liquidations daily chart. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><p>When a long position is liquidated, the trader is compelled to sell, leading to increased selling pressure. </p><h2>Is the Solana bull market over?</h2><p>Price chart technicals suggest that Solana's price correction has begun near a key Fibonacci retracement level, which limits its upside bias in the coming months.</p><p>The 0.236 Fib line is near $67.40, which has acted as resistance since summer 2022. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/aea30476-f312-4c44-902b-a966dea8233e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The combination of these bearish factors raises SOL's potential of extending its correction in the coming days or weeks. That begins with a decline toward $47.50, a flipped-support level, followed by an extended selloff toward $30, if the former level breaks. </p><p>The $30-level, down 50% from current prices, coincides with Solana's 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) and the upper trendline of its previous ascending channel pattern.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-responds-kraken-lawsuit-deaton-slams-dishonorable-gensler\">Crypto community responds to Kraken lawsuit, Deaton slams ‘dishonorable’ Gensler</a></em></strong></p><p>Conversely, SOL's price could rebound ahead or after testing $47.50 to its year-to-date high near $68. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
