    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-analyst-xrp-5-85/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Dark Defender has also weighed in on the recent narratives revolving around the XRP tepid price action. The analyst is choosing not to listen to any of those as he is confident that the future trajectory of the XRP token is bullish.  No Need To Listen To FUD In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dark Defender mentioned that he doesn’t listen to the FUD (Fear, uncertainty, and doubt). He also seemed to be urging the XRP community to ignore the FUD as he stated that the token is still proceeding according to “our plan” based on the weekly time frame.  Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Balances Drop Drastically, What This Means For ETH Price Source: X He alluded back to several comments and analyses he had made about XRP’s price action. One of them was on June 4, when he had set Wave 1 on the charts to $0.89. On June 21, he also detailed the target levels that XRP could attain. Meanwhile, he had set the limit for Wave 2 to $0.46 and Wave 3 to $1.88 on September 13.  Dark Defender noted that nothing has changed since then, as the targets “were and are the same.” The crypto analyst was basically suggesting that there was no need to be worried about XRP’s price action as everything was going according to plan from a technical analysis perspective.   XRP Still Headed To $5.85 As to XRP’s future trajectory, Dark Defender reaffirmed that the upcoming target is still $1.88 and $5.85 based on the Elliot Waves, which he had highlighted months back. From the accompanying chart that he shared, Dark Defender focused more on the $5.85 price level.  Source: X He is confident in XRP hitting that price because he foresees the token touching the “261.80% Fibonacci Level at $5.85.” It won’t, however, be up from $1.88 as the crypto analyst predicts that there will be a correction from that price level.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble: Whale Transfers 85 Million DOGE To Robinhood Going by Dark Defender’s past price predictions, $5.85 won’t be the peak, as one can still expect upward price movement. The crypto analyst had previously mentioned that XRP would hit $18 soon enough. He noted then that XRP was likely going to face a strong resistance at $1.08. However, he projects that it will be “kaboom” once XRP is able to break from that level.  In the meantime, many will be hoping that XRP can at least experience a significant rally to end the year. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.61, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Token price at $0.61 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from U.Today, chart from Tradingview.com"
