Period.”</blockquote><p>He stressed that the Academy will not give a Grammy or a nomination thereof to the AI portion of the track. For example, if an AI voice model performs lead vocals on the track, it could be eligible in the songwriting category but not in the performance category and vice versa, the AP reported. </p><p>This is because “what is performing is not a human creation,” Mason explained, according to the AP. He said that as long as human is contributing more, and in a meaningful way, it will “always” be considered. For now, the Academy says it will not be awarding AI itself any awards. </p><blockquote> “We don’t want to see technology replace human creativity. We want to make sure technology is enhancing, embellishing, or additive to human creativity.”</blockquote><p>These clarifications from the Academy CEO comesafter the organization updated its <a href=\"https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/66_Rulebook_06.28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">rules</a> and eligibility criteria on June 28 that said, “a work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any categories.” </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-updates-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-data-scraping-for-ai-training\"><strong><em>Google updates its privacy policy to allow data scraping for AI training</em></strong></a></p><p>AI prevalence has skyrocketed since the emergence and widespread use of the AI chatbot ChatGPT since November 2022. </p><p>Some artists, such as Grimes, have openly welcomed the use of the technology, and even said she’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/musician-grimes-willing-to-split-50-royalties-with-ai-generated-music\">willing to split 50% royalties</a> with any creators who use her voice track for a successful song. </p><p>On the other hand, the rapper Ice Cube, famous for his work in the late 80s and early 90s, called with N.W.A.,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub75SGt-x40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> called AI demonic</a> and said he would sue anyone mimicking his voice on AI tracks, along with the platforms that host the song. </p><p>According to Mason, the Grammy’s have been heavily considering how to deal with the inclusion or exclusion of AI and even <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/news/recording-academy-ceo-harvey-mason-jr-discusses-2024-grammys-new-rules-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">held</a> a summit with industry leaders on the future of AI in music.</p><p>He said he’s “imagining” that the technology will be involved in a lot of records and songs this year.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stablecoin-volumes-stagnant/",
    "description": "Stablecoins, the digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, have long been viewed as a potential bridge between the cryptocurrency world and the traditional financial industry. However, recent developments have cast a shadow of uncertainty over their perceived stability.  As global policymakers continue to grapple with concerns about the crypto sector&#8217;s impact on the established financial system, a surprising twist occurred when stress in the US banking industry reverberated throughout the stablecoin market.  According to Fitch Ratings, the tightening of financial conditions, culminating in the high-profile failures of several banks, notably including the collapse of the esteemed Silicon Valley Bank, had a profound impact on stablecoins.  Stablecoins: Market Shakeup For instance, Fitch Ratings reports that the market capitalization of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, experienced a sharp decline of over 25% in the first quarter. Although the coin&#8217;s value remains depressed, Fitch noted that it managed to recover its peg soon after.  Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor According to data from The Block, the total supply of stablecoins has decreased from $138 billion at the beginning of the year to $124 billion as of July 3. This decline in supply further underscores the challenges faced by stablecoins and their struggle to maintain stability amidst market turbulence. Chart: The Block Crypto Data “Significant volatility, shaken investor confidence, and temporary but sharp de-pegging occurred in the stablecoin market in March as shockwaves spread from traditional finance,” Fitch wrote. Tether Bucks Trend In contrast to USDC, Tether, another prominent stablecoin, observed a 12% increase in its market capitalization during the same period. Notably, Tether captured approximately 72% of USDC&#8217;s redemption volume, indicating a growing preference for Tether among investors. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Despite Tether&#8217;s positive performance, the top 10 stablecoins experienced a decline in their monthly average of daily trading volumes. From March to May 2023, these trading volumes decreased from $53 billion to $28 billion. This reduction signifies a decrease in activity within the stablecoin market, possibly driven by cautious investor sentiment in the face of ongoing market uncertainties. Bitcoin approaches the $31K territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Fitch noted that efforts to regulate stablecoins have been unfolding at varying speeds in the United States and Europe, leading to notable differences in the reporting and transparency standards of these digital assets. The contrasting approaches taken by the two regions have resulted in distinct regulatory landscapes for stablecoins, causing direct consequences on their reporting and transparency practices.
