    "description": "Amid the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price rally, cryptocurrency analyst CryptoCon has shed his optimism about the price action of the crypto asset while highlighting a bold prediction. Bitcoin To Experience Pullback Beforehand On Tuesday, December 26, CryptoCon took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his latest projections on Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the price of BTC will reach the $130,000 mark, but it might undergo a correction beforehand. In the X post, CryptoCon reiterated his opinion that, many weeks ago, Bitcoin peaked at roughly $45,000. He further highlighted that the LMACD includes another layer with a cross of the &#8220;Descending Cycle Mid-Top Trend.&#8221; Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When He suggests that Bitcoin is about to experience a &#8220;significant pullback.&#8221; The analyst highlighted that the &#8220;correction ranges from 38% to 52%&#8221; from its peak of around $45,000. In addition, CryptoCon predicts that a period of correction lasting &#8220;up to five to six months&#8221; will follow the correction. He added that these declines would cease in May 2024, as he sees an upward trajectory despite his correction projections. The crypto analyst highlighted the &#8220;Green Year Accumulation&#8221; phase in his projections. He then underscored the opportunity this correction offers investors who couldn&#8217;t take advantage of favorable entry during this phase.  He sees an opportunity for investors to enter the Bitcoin market at a &#8220;more reasonable&#8221; price during this possible correction. However, overleveraged long may suffer due to the potential correction from the recent highs.  Furthermore, the analyst continued by pointing out the advantages of Bitcoin&#8217;s future performance. He expects Bitcoin to reach a fresh peak in November or December 2025. CryptoCon&#8217;s predictions for BTC to reach an all-time high by the time above were based on the &#8220;Halving Cycles Theory.&#8221; He then asserted that after careful price experiments, he expects BTC to be around &#8220;$130,000 by the end of 2025.&#8221; Rise In BTC&#8217;s Addresses Holding Millions Of Dollars A recent report has revealed an uptick in the total number of Bitcoin millionaires in 2023. Data from BitInfoCharts shows the number of BTC millionaires has increased by 246% in 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators Currently, Bitcoin millionaires are around 97,497, according to the data provided by the platform. This indicates a notable growth compared to this year, with 23,795 addresses worth at least $1 million. Furthermore, BitinfoCharts has divided these 97,497 millionaires into two distinct parts. Addresses that contain at least $1 million are 90,040, while those containing more than $10 million make up for the rest. This uptick can be traced back to the rise in BTC&#8217;s price this year, which has seen a year-to-date gain of nearly 158%. Earlier this year, the price of BTC was around $16,000.
