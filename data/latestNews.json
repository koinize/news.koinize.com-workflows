Blockchain data reveals that this transaction called the \"anySwapFeeTo\" method on the Multichain Router: V4 contract, causing approximately $15,275.90 worth of anyDAI to be minted on Ethereum and sent to the Multichain Executor, who then burned it and exchanged it for the underlying DAI stablecoin backing the asset. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/f270ba91-d1e6-40ed-af58-42daa75f9062.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DAI conversion by Multichain Executor.

Ethereum blockchain data shows that this address <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48dc95a39e4c2c41ad3bdfadeddd5b7f57f87d83f07b3a9c3e49727f957da2ec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">received</a> the redeemed DAI from the Multichain Executor on July 10, about five minutes after the previous transaction.</p><p>Data for BNB Smart Chain (BSC) shows that the Multichain Executor also <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/tx/0x84507ad22a2e3e4cc5d1957059c72cc96b37c056101bed638edae16b7a590c8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">called</a> the anySwapFeeTo function on its network for $208,997 worth of anySwap US Dollar Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>). This resulted in $208,997 worth of the tokens being converted into their underlying Binance-Pegged USDC, which were subsequently sent to this same address. In other BSC transactions, the contract used this process to convert 50.80 anyBTC, worth $39,251.43 at the time, to equivalent Binance-Pegged Bitcoin (BTCB) and send it to this address.</p><p>The transactions add up to approximately $263,524.33 worth of tokens sent to this address through the anySwapFeeTo method.</p><p>Spreek said this behavior could be part of the normal functioning of the protocol. On the other hand, a different account had engaged in similar behavior the day before, they stated. The other account eventually sold the drained tokens, providing evidence that it was malicious:</p><blockquote>“It is unclear whether this is authorized behavior. Previously the same method was used yesterday by a different MPC address on the anyUSDT token on mainnet. The tokens were then immediately sold to ETH, suggesting that that similar address was the actions of a malicious actor.”</blockquote><p>The on-chain sleuth theorized that the attacker may be using the anySwapFeeTo function to set fees to an arbitrarily large amount, allowing them to drain users’ funds. This function “Apparently allows ANY value to be set, so the address is simply choosing the total value of the token held in that anyToken,” Spreek stated.</p><p>The Multichain incident has baffled blockchain analysts, as no one has been able to prove whether it resulted from an exploit or is simply the result of large token holders moving their funds between networks. The mystery began on July 7 when over $100 million worth of tokens <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-mpc-bridge-sees-millions-in-outflows-exploit-feared\">were withdrawn from the Ethereum side</a> of Multichain’s Fantom, Moonriver, and Dogechain bridges and sent to wallet addresses with no previous transactions. These withdrawals represented the majority of funds held on each bridge. </p><p>The Multichain team declared that the withdrawals were “abnormal” and told users to stop using the protocol. However, they did not declare what the source of the anomaly was or could be.</p><p>On July 8, stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-tether-freezes-over-65m-in-assets-transferred-from-multichain\">froze some of the addresses</a> that received funds tied to the strange transactions. On July 11, blockchain analytics firm <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-tether-freezes-over-65m-in-assets-transferred-from-multichain\">Chainanalysis said the incident</a> “looks more like a hack or rugpull and less like a migration.”</p><p>The Multichain team says their <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-team-cannot-locate-ceo-halts-service-for-affected-chains\">CEO is missing</a> and that they've shut down some bridges due to no longer having access to some of the network's multi-party computation network servers.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "At the beginning of July, Binance announced its latest collaboration with soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. The partnership will launch a new non-fungible token (NFT) collection called &#8220;Forever CR7: The GOAT,&#8221; featuring 20 unique designs spread across four levels of rarity.  The collection will celebrate some of the most iconic moments from Ronaldo&#8217;s illustrious career, with each NFT representing a significant goal or milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s NFT Collection On Binance The &#8220;Forever CR7: The GOAT&#8221; collection is significant because it marks a major milestone in the convergence of sports and NFTs. The partnership between Binance and Ronaldo is expected to generate significant interest within the crypto and sports communities.  Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, commented on the partnership, saying they are thrilled to partner with Ronaldo on this new NFT collection. Ronaldo is one of the greatest soccer players of all time and a global icon with an enormous fan base. They believe the Forever CR7 collection will be a huge success and milestone in the sports and NFT industries. Related Reading: Crypto Update: Top 3 Altcoins To Watch This Week The growing trend of athletes monetizing their brands through digital collectibles is evident in the NFT collections released by other sports stars.  For example, American football quarterback Tom Brady partnered with NFT platform Autograph to release a collection of digital collectibles in 2021, while basketball player JaVale McGee released a collection of NFTs called &#8220;Mint Condition&#8221; through the NFT marketplace, OpenSea.  Other sports stars who released NFTs include soccer players Gerard Pique, Mesut Ozil, and boxer Tyson Fury. But there is a possibility of another battle between two of soccer&#8217;s greatest players, often considered the GOATs in the sport, but this time off the pitch. Will Lionel Messi enter the NFT marketplace and release his collection in collaboration with a major exchange like Binance to compete with Cristiano Ronaldo? Messi Vs. Ronaldo, Is An NFTs Showdown On The Horizon? Lionel Messi has already made his mark in the NFT world by releasing his latest collection in collaboration with Ethernal Labs. The collection features five digital collectibles commemorating Messi&#8217;s international career, and they are available for purchase using Ethernity&#8217;s native crypto token, ERN.  In a statement, Messi expressed his excitement about his latest NFT collection and his partnership with Ethernal Labs:  I am happy to kick off my next NFT collection in partnership with Ethernal Lab. I look forward to joining my fans in celebrating my career with my National Team with this NFT experience on the ethernity.io marketplace.  There is a possibility that Messi may collaborate with a major exchange such as Binance or with a different company or project to expand his NFT venture further and compete with Ronaldo&#8217;s offerings. Such a collaboration would give Messi access to a broader market and allow him to reach a more extensive fan base.  Related Reading: PEPE Potential Rebound: Key Details You Shouldn’t Miss This prospect is even more interesting because Binance currently sponsors the Argentinian National soccer team. This link between the exchange and Messi&#8217;s home country could provide the perfect opportunity for the two parties to come together and create something extraordinary.  Binance&#8217;s Argentinian National soccer team sponsorship could also provide a unique marketing opportunity for the exchange. By collaborating with Messi, Binance could tap into the massive fan base of the soccer star and reach a wider audience in Latin America and beyond. Messi&#8217;s popularity and success in the NFT space and Binance&#8217;s reputation and sponsorship of the Argentinian National soccer team make this collaboration a natural fit. The soccer star&#8217;s latest NFT collection with Ethernal Labs has already shown his potential to succeed in the NFT market, and a partnership with Binance or with a different project could take his NFT offerings to the next level.
