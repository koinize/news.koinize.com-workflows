    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-3000-15/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has been continuously bullish on the future of the XRP price and the latest prediction proves this. This time around, the crypto analyst is using a rare Bent Fork Pattern to back up his prediction that the XRP price is headed for double-digits. The Rare Bent Fork Pattern Egrag first mentioned the Bent Fork Pattern in a June post while showing a bullish roadmap for the XRP price. In the earlier post, the analyst points out ‘four distinct tracks’. These include the “Track A) Major Historical Support, Track B) Ranging Zone, Track C) Mid-Cycle Top, and Track D) Cycle Top.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire As Egrag explained, the Track D is the cycle top which could see the altcoin’s price reach as high as $15, although not without incidence. Despite expecting a surge, Egrag says that XRP could fall lower before this happens. However, the analyst asks investors not to fret when this happens. Rather, they should see it as an opportunity to buy the cryptocurrency for lower prices. Now, four months after the initial post was made, Egrag has revisited this Bent Fork Pattern, doubling down on the previous prediction. In a post made on Wednesday, October 18, Egrag updated the previous prediction, showing what needs to happen for the XRP price to reach the lofty price of $15. This would mean at least a 3,000% price increase for XRP if the pattern plays out exactly as expected. In the chart below, the analyst explains that the XRP price needs to breach the white line for the rally to begin. “the real excitement is if #XRP shatters the &#8216;White&#8217; Ascending Triangle – get ready for some market-shaking action,” the analyst said. Bent Fork Pattern points to bullish recovery &#124; Source: X Looking at a time frame, the crypto analyst asks investors to keep an eye out for the 3rd and 4th week of November as this is when something interesting might happen. “Feeling uncertain about your next move? This might just be your last chance to seize a buying opportunity,” Egrag said in closing. Not The Only Bullish Chart For XRP Price Interestingly, Egrag’s XRP price prediction using the Bent Fork Pattern also matches their other predictions for the altcoin. Earlier in the week, Egrag had also put forward another forecast but used the Elliot Wave Theory to present the bull case. Related Reading: Ripple Job Posting Sparks IPO Rumors, Will XRP Price Finally Cross $100? As Egrag notes, the fifth wave is where the main movement really lies where the analyst expects the price surge to happen. Just like with the Bent Fork Pattern, it also suggests a double-digit price level at the top. However, the wave theory takes it a step further with a $27 price mark compared to the Bent Fork’s $15 mark. Another similarity between both predictions is that the June Bent Fork chart shows the XRP price at $15 somewhere between 2025 and 2026. This is the same timeframe presented using the Elliot Wave analysis, so most of this will likely play out in the bull market.

    "title": "What is USDT? All About Tether Stablecoin Cryptocurrency",
    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/tether/what-is-usdt-tether-stablecoin-cryptocurrency/",
    "description": "USDT, also known as Tether, has become an integral part of cryptocurrency markets since its launch in 2014. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, it is the most widely used stablecoin with a market capitalization of over $83 billion as of October 2023. But it is also controversial, with opaque reserves and questions around its long-term viability. Here is an in-depth look at how USDT works, its importance in crypto, and the risks it presents. What is USDT? Overview of Tether Stablecoin Cryptocurrency At its core, Tether functions as a stablecoin, meaning each token is backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currency. This peg to the dollar aims to minimize volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. USDT operates on different blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron and others, allowing it to be transferred seamlessly between different networks. Crypto traders rely on USDT as a stable store of value when trading between different digital assets. It is also widely used on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for lending, borrowing, and making payments. USDT price: $1 USDT Market Cap: ~$83 billion (as of October 2023) Key Features of USDT Crypto The key features that define Tether include: Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar – USDT aims to maintain parity with the dollar Operates on different blockchains – Enables transfer between networks Hedges against crypto volatility – Acts as a stable haven when markets are fluctuating Wide adoption – Used extensively in crypto trading and DeFi protocols How Does USDT Maintain Its Dollar Peg? According to Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, every token in circulation is backed 1:1 by their reserves, which include both traditional currency and cash equivalents. When buyers purchase USDT by depositing $1 per token, new tokens are issued while the dollars are held in reserves. This mechanism theoretically allows users to redeem each USDT to USD. By allowing two-way convertibility between USDT and dollars, the supply can adjust to maintain the 1:1 parity. However, Tether’s reserves have been shrouded in secrecy over the years, leading to allegations that the company does not hold sufficient dollar reserves to back all USDT in circulation. Tether settled a case with the New York Attorney General in 2021, agreeing to release periodic reports on its reserves. So far, the redemptions have generally maintained the dollar peg. But questions linger over the breakdown of reserves and their adequacy as USDT supply has ballooned. USDT Price Chart from CoinMarketCap The Role and Importance of USDT in Crypto Despite the opacity, USDT continues to play a hugely important role in cryptocurrency markets. It is one of the most widely traded crypto assets, with daily trading volumes in the billions of dollars against assets like Bitcoin. Exchanges rely on stablecoin trading pairs like BTC/USDT to enable traders to hedge risk during times of high volatility. USDT is also widely integrated into DeFi protocols like lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, yield farms, and more. It provides stability in an otherwise volatile environment for decentralized finance. The demand for USDT trading, transactions, and parking value in a stable asset continues to drive increasing adoption. Future Outlook for Tether Stablecoin Going forward, the biggest threat to USDT is the risk of losing its 1:1 dollar peg and collapsing in value if its reserves are inadequate. Tether also faces potential regulatory crackdowns from authorities who may threaten its viability. Competing stablecoins like USDC and BUSD are more transparent about reserves and could gain share. However, USDT retains first-mover advantage and the network effects of wider integration in crypto infrastructure. It continues to maintain peg stability through redemptions so far. If Tether can provide greater transparency and embrace compliance, USDT may retain its dominant position for some time. But traders should exercise caution and understand the risks of relying too much on USDT long-term. Despite controversies around reserves and regulation, Tether remains an integral cog in the crypto economy machine. But as the market matures, stablecoins built on greater transparency and compliance are likely to emerge as leaders. How Does USDT Work? There are a few key mechanisms that enable USDT to function as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar: Minting and Issuing New USDT Tether mints new USDT when buyers deposit $1 per token with the company. The dollars are added to reserves, while an equivalent amount of USDT is issued on the blockchain ledger. This USDT enters circulation when transferred to the buyer&#8217;s wallet address. The minting helps adjust supply to match demand. Sending and Receiving USDT Transactions Once issued, USDT can be transacted between addresses on its supported blockchains like any other cryptocurrency. Senders can broadcast transactions and pay small network fees to send USDT to recipients&#8217; wallet addresses. These peer-to-peer transactions are recorded transparently on public blockchain explorers. Trading USDT on Exchanges and DeFi USDT is listed as a trading pair on most major centralized crypto exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges. Traders can use USDT to buy and sell other cryptos like Bitcoin in a stable manner when volatility is high. In decentralized finance, USDT also serves as a stable currency for lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and more. Redeeming USDT for Dollars In theory, USDT holders can redeem each token for exactly 1 US dollar from Tether Limited. This is made possible by the underlying reserves that back each token. Redemptions help maintain the 1:1 peg when USDT falls below $1 on exchanges. However, Tether reserves the right to delay or deny redemptions in some circumstances. Pros and Cons of USDT Stablecoin USDT provides stability amid crypto volatility but also carries risks: Pros Avoid volatility by parking value in USDT Seamless transfers between blockchains Wide acceptance in crypto ecosystem Useful for decentralized trading and finance Cons Opaque reserves raise viability concerns Regulatory crackdowns could threaten operations Reliant on Tether’s redemption policy to maintain peg Vulnerable to bank runs if reserves are inadequate Tether pioneered stablecoins in crypto but transparent alternatives like USDC are emerging. Regulatory direction will play a key role in determining whether USDT maintains dominance long-term. In conclusion, USDT remains indispensable for crypto trading and finance today. But prudent users should assess risks of relying extensively on USDT if its opaque operations and reserves raise too many questions about its sustainability. As the sector develops, the stability and transparency offered by its competitors could make them a safer bet over the coming years USDT FAQ: Tether Frequently Asked Questions &#38; Answers What is USDT TRC20?

Is it safe to invest in USDT stablecoin? USDT does carry risks related to transparency and reserves that should be considered. Stablecoins like USDC with more transparency could potentially be safer long-term investments."

Potential Impact On Bitcoin Matrixport&#8217;s foresight, outlined in their 2023 outlook report published on December 9, 2022, projected a substantial crypto rally driven by factors such as lower US inflation and favorable macroeconomic conditions.  This projection anticipated strong rebounds for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), along with a notable decrease in volatility. Related Reading: ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market Surrounding the approval of these pending applications, a standout performer in the market has been Grayscale Investments&#8217; Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with its share prices surging by an impressive 167% year-to-date, outpacing Bitcoin&#8217;s 71% growth.  While GBTC&#8217;s net-asset-value (NAV) discount marginally narrowed from -45% to -43% at the beginning of the year, the game-changing moment arrived when BlackRock announced its ETF application on June 15, 2023. Matrixport&#8217;s earlier reports analyzed the US registered investor advisor (RIA) community, comprising approximately 15,000 advisors overseeing around $5 trillion.  Recognizing the potential of this group, the report suggests that even a modest 1% allocation recommendation for Bitcoin would result in approximately $50 billion in inflows.  $56,000 BTC Price Projection Drawing a parallel with precious metals ETFs boasting an estimated $120 billion in market capitalization, and assuming that between 10-20% of precious metal ETF investors explore a Bitcoin ETF as a diversification tactic against monetary debasement and inflation hedges, the potential influx into the Bitcoin ETF could reach a significant $12-24 billion. The report speculates on the implications for Tether&#8217;s market capitalization by looking at the potential impact of BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF approval.  Acting as a proxy for potential ETF inflows, a $24 billion increase in Tether&#8217;s market cap could conservatively push Bitcoin&#8217;s price to $42,000. With an even larger influx of $50 billion resulting from a 1% allocation by RIAs, Bitcoin could rally to $56,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For Massive Rally As BlackRock And JPMorgan Make Their Move Overall, Matrixport&#8217;s analysis sheds light on the potential ripple effects of Bitcoin ETF approval, extending beyond Bitcoin&#8217;s immediate market and encompassing Tether and the wider cryptocurrency landscape. As market participants eagerly await regulatory decisions, the industry remains poised for potential growth and transformation. As of the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin (BTC), is trading at $28,700, reflecting a 1.8% increase over the past 24 hours. It is worth noting that BTC has successfully maintained the gains it has made since mid-September. During this period, the cryptocurrency broke its short-term downtrend structure after reaching its peak for the year at $31,800 on July 13.
