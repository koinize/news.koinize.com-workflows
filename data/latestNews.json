    "description": "Bitcoin price is holding gains above $37,000. BTC is consolidating and might soon aim for another rally if it clears the $38,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin is still consolidating below the $37,750 resistance. The price is trading above $37,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance near $37,420 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a strong increase if it clears the $38,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price remained well-bid and started a steady increase above the $37,000 resistance. BTC trimmed all losses and even revisited the $37,750 resistance zone. It seems like the bulls are still struggling to clear the $37,750 resistance zone. A high was formed near $37,848 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $35,645 swing low to the $37,848 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $37,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance near $37,420 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $37,420 level. The first major resistance is forming near $37,750. The main resistance is still near the $38,000 level. A close above the $38,0000 resistance might start a strong increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be near $38,800, above which BTC could rise and test the $39,200 level. In the stated case, it could even rally toward the $40,000 resistance. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $37,750 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $37,200 level. The next major support is $37,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The first key support is at $36,750 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $35,645 swing low to the $37,848 high. If there is a move below $36,750, there is a risk of more downsides. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $36,000 support in the near term. The next key support or target could be $35,650. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $37,000, followed by $36,750. Major Resistance Levels – $37,750, $38,000, and $38,800."
