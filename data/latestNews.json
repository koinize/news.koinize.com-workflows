    "description": "In the wake of a sideways XRP price action followed by a significant decline after Ripple&#8217;s legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a new wave of speculation has emerged, fueled by the astrology-inspired tattoo sported by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.  Unveiled during a recent Ripple party held to celebrate the legal triumph on July 13, the tattoo has captured widespread attention, triggering discussions and conjecture about its potential significance. And as for any “announcement” that people are wondering about, tonight’s event is just a celebration…but I will share my recent addition: pic.twitter.com/q4THzsr4Fp — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) September 29, 2023  Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Revival Of “Satoshi Nakamoto” Account Could Signal Slump In BTC Price? Ripple CEO&#8217;s Intriguing Tattoo Sparks Speculation The tattoo, prominently displayed on Garlinghouse&#8217;s arm, features a combination of intriguing symbols, including the XRP logo, moon, planets, rocket, and constellations.  XRP enthusiasts have been dissecting these elements in search of hidden messages and insights into Ripple&#8217;s long-term plans. Some interpret the tattoo as a bold statement of confidence in XRP&#8217;s prospects. In contrast, others delve deeper into its symbolism, particularly regarding the next anticipated XRP price surge date. Jeremy Hogan, a prominent lawyer supporting XRP, has taken on the role of decoding the tattoo&#8217;s cryptic meaning. According to Hogan, the tattoo&#8217;s elliptical shape represents the solar eclipse that will occur on April 8th, as observed from the coordinates 37°46′39″N 122°24′59″W.  Notably, this elliptical path intersects with the full &#8220;moon&#8221; when viewed from northern latitudes. Many within the XRP community have embraced this interpretation, considering it a potential indication of an upcoming bull run. Historical patterns in the cryptocurrency market are worth considering to bolster this hypothesis regarding a potential price surge on April 8 or in the first half of 2024. These patterns lend credibility to the notion that significant events, such as the Bitcoin halving, can influence market trends. In April, the next Bitcoin halving is expected, marking a reduction in the mining reward for Bitcoin. Past halving events have often coincided with notable price increases for Bitcoin, suggesting a potential positive impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. Moreover, another crucial factor that could propel XRP to new heights is the possibility of another legal victory against the US SEC. Such a win could restore confidence and open doors for further adoption and usage of the token.  Although the outcome remains uncertain, these developments contribute to an atmosphere of anticipation within the crypto community. XRP Price Struggles Below Key Moving Averages After experiencing a prolonged downward trend over the past three months, the price of XRP has now dipped below two critical levels: its 200-day and 50-day Moving Averages (MAs).  These MAs have proven to be significant obstacles to the token&#8217;s potential for future growth, suggesting the possibility of a retracement or consolidation phase below current price levels.

These levels now serve as resistance barriers for the token, making it more challenging for XRP to regain upward momentum. Another noteworthy indicator of the unsuccessful attempt to penetrate upper resistance lines is XRP&#8217;s squeeze momentum indicator and ADX.  The squeeze momentum indicator indicates a downward slump in what was anticipated to be an upward movement, impeded by the resistance barriers. Additionally, the ADX reflects declining buying activity and bullish momentum among investors and bulls. The future course of XRP remains uncertain, as it is yet to be determined whether the token will succumb again to a wave of selling pressure or remain in a consolidation phase below these critical levels, potentially delaying another uptrend.

    "description": "A recent analysis by an analyst has painted a clearer picture of just how volatile the crypto market has been, especially for those who took their chances on lesser-known altcoins a few years back. The analyst studied the top 100 cryptocurrencies as they stood in December 2017 and found that the fortunes of these digital assets varied significantly over the past six years. Related Reading: Crypto Fund Flows: Bitcoin Leads As Solana Follows, But Why’s Ethereum Left Behind? From Prominent To Obscure: The Rise And Fall Of 2017&#8217;s Crypto Stars Six years in the financial world is relatively short, but it can seem like an eternity for the fast-paced crypto market.  An X (formerly known as Twitter) user named davanai shared his analysis of the top 100 cryptos in 2017, revealing some startling figures. Out of the top 10 cryptos, New Economic Movement (XEM) is the only one that has dropped out of the top 100 list. On the other hand, previous giants like Monero and Dash are teetering on the brink of exiting the elite group. Amid these declines, the twin towers of the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have held their positions at 1st and 2nd spot, respectively. XRP, among the most discussed cryptos in the 2017 bull run, has slipped only slightly to the 5th position. Cardano (ADA), too, while losing two spots, remains in the top ten. However, not all stories are of resilience. Populous Coin (PPT), once the 19th largest crypto, is now a shadow of its former self, trading at 99.97% below its all-time high. Distinguishing The Winners From The Losers Interestingly, the analyst classified 27 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies as &#8220;scams&#8221;. While this doesn&#8217;t directly confirm any deceit, these digital currencies have nearly vanished in terms of market presence and activity. Out of the top 100, just 21 achieved record highs during the initial three months of 2021, while 68 remain below their highest valuations from 2017 or &#8220;almost a scam,&#8221; according to the analyst. Research statistics: 🟢 5 of 20 are worth more than ATH 2021 ⚫ 27 of 100 SCAM project 🔴 68 of 100 are below ATH 2017 or almost a scam 🟢 21 of 100 updated ATH in 2021 🔴 79 of 100 will never update ATH — davanai👻 (@0xdavanai) October 2, 2023 On the brighter side, three altcoins have climbed up in their rankings since 2017. Binance Coin (BNB), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have defied the broader trend, proving that it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom in the altcoin world. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Price Vs.

As the analyst pointed out, purchasing the top 100 cryptos would likely result in losses over time. As traditionally understood, diversification may not apply in the high-stakes world of crypto investing. • You should buy altcoins with a clear understanding of the situation, and not relying on luck • Don&#8217;t listen to fables about diversification, because only 3 out of 100 tokens are profitable in the long run • Cryptocurrency profitability is about mindset and strategy — davanai👻 (@0xdavanai) October 2, 2023 Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-historical-data-suggests-substantial-q4-rally-possible/",
    "description": "XRP price might have struggled to leave the $0.50 range over the last several months, even despite a victory in Ripple’s case with the SEC.  But all that could change in Q4 2023, as the fourth quarter of the year is historically the most bullish for the altcoin.  With this in mind, let’s dig into the data and see how Q4 stacks up against the historical performance of other quarters of the year. Plus, we’ll pin-point precisely which month is by far the most bullish of them all.  Q4 Performance Is The Best Historically For XRP Price XRP price at the moment is trading at around $0.51 after a fierce rejection following Ripple’s big win in the case against the SEC. The altcoin was promptly relisted on top cryptocurrency exchanges, but it hasn’t led to the demand necessary to sustain higher prices.  Related Reading: Select XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond But that could change soon, now that Q3 is over and Q4 is here. The cryptocurrency is coming out of its worst quarter on average, so lack of performance isn’t too surprising. Q4, however, according to historical averages in performance across all quarters, is by far the most substantial.  Q4 on average has provided an average of 30% ROI. Right behind it is Q2, posting roughly 22% ROI. Q1 averages a modest 13%, while Q3 comes in last with only 6% on average. There’s no guarantee this data will translate into returns during this last quarter of the year, but seasonality and serial correlation are common in finance and cryptocurrencies.  Why It Could Take Til December For The Bull Run To Begin Unfortunately, October isn’t the beginning of a massive bull run the previous text makes it sound. While the data doesn’t lie — XRP price performs the best historically in Q4 on average, but Q4 represents October through the end of December.  On a month-by-month basis, October is actually the third worst month on average. If the same positive seasonality in XRP were to follow along the data’s projections accurately, then it would also suggest that October might be another month of pain and sideways for investors.  At an almost 12% gain in November on average compared to October’s 1.5% average decline, the second to last month of the year will turn things green. But even November isn’t quite the relief XRP holders would hope for. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, &#38; Ethereum: Three Top Coins On Brink Of Golden Cross That doesn’t arrive until December, which is by far and away the best month on average for XRP, with an 80% ROI on average. The one caveat, is that the majority of the returns occurred during the 2017 bull market, potentially skewing the results. Removing the outlier from the data would almost certainly change the results significantly. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Sign up for free.
