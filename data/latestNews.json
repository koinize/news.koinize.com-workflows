We strive to deliver the most thoughtful, engaging and impactful news affecting the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Earlier today, during routine coverage, Cointelegraph’s social media team posted a message on X without prior editorial approval stating that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had approved BlackRock’s iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF. This was false, the result of misinformation. The news lead originated from an unconfirmed screenshot posted by an X user who claimed it was from the Bloomberg Terminal.</p><p>Cointelegraph did not ultimately publish an article with this incorrect information, but we deeply regret posting this in error on X and the impact it has caused. An internal investigation revealed that our standard procedure for posting breaking news on social media, wherein sources are required to be verified before posting to social media, was not followed.</p><p>The timeline of events is as follows:</p><p><strong>13:17:30 UTC: </strong>The editorial team was alerted to the rumored news through a Telegram channel that Cointelegraph employees use to discover stories that might be of interest to readers (Figure 1). The full conversation is shared below.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/4e99ef14-84ab-41e4-88a9-2e3764030e89.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 1</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/50377b55-5b14-45d1-a089-c7773dd3169e.jpeg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 2</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>13:19:27 UTC: </strong>Employee 1 reposted the text of the lead shared by a Telegram account that has since been deleted (Figure 2) to an internal Slack channel (Figure 3). </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/856964f4-07c2-40ba-b314-a354cbba4d01.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 3, Figure 4</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>13:24:16 UTC:</strong> In an effort to publish the developments as soon as possible, Employee 2 posted the report to X without prior confirmation of the source’s veracity from the editor.
