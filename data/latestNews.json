Because of this, production in larger quantities is more feasible as they require lesser fees to mint. </p><p>According to Magic Eden, this type of NFT is ideal for the creation of mass-produced collections in various industries like gaming, music, events and the metaverse. The NFT marketplace believes that it allows creators to reach wider audiences without spending more. </p><p>The NFT marketplace also believes that by lowering the costs involved in NFT production, it can potentially promote adoption and become an \"easy access point\" for new people to try out collecting NFTs. With lower costs, users can collect NFTs without risking a large amount of funds to acquire collections. It lowers the risk of losing money over NFTs. </p><p>cNFTs are powered by Solana’s state compression, a feature that allows as many as 1 million NFTs to be <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/state-compression-compressed-nfts-solana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">minted</a> with just around $110. Compared to minting NFTs on Ethereum which could cost anywhere from $2.9 to over $30 to mint per NFT, the cost of minting is drastically lowered with cNFTs. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wth-did-i-just-witness-magic-eden-turns-porno-after-hosting-service-hacked\"><strong><em>‘WTH did I just witness?'
