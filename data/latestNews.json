According to the announcement a team of renowned researchers has already been set up and it will be spearheaded by Iliad chairman Xavier Niel. </p><p>Niel said an “entire ecosystem needs to be built up in France” and the research lab will be playing a role in that. The lab's main purpose will be to build general AI to bring to “everyone’s reach” and make AI research publicly available. </p><p>In addition to the lab, Iliad has acquired what it deemed as “the most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer deployed to date in Europe.” An NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD equipped with NVIDIA DGX H100 systems has been installed at the company’s Datacenter 5 near Paris. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related:</u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-france-launches-certificate-finfluencers-including-crypto\"><strong><em> France launches a certificate for ‘finfluencers,’ including crypto</em></strong></a></p><p>On acquiring the NVIDIA supercomputer Niel commented that:</p><blockquote>“To have clout in the AI market, you need computing power. To have computing power you need supercomputers. And to have supercomputers you need to invest. To invest massively.” </blockquote><p>The company says the DGX SuperPOD produces the power necessary to rapidly train large language models (LLMs). </p><p>Additionally, a subsidiary company of Iliad called Scaleway now plans to offer its clients access to a full suite of cloud-native AI tools, such as the ability to train various-sized models. </p><p>Damien Lucas, the CEO of Scaleway said with these tools European companies can “significantly” advance their innovations in AI to be competitive on an international level. </p><p>This news comes shortly after the president of the European Union, Ursula von der Leyen, announced on Sept. 13 a forthcoming initiative to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-announces-initiative-supercomputer-access-artificial-intelligence-ai-startups\">help AI startups</a> with accelerated access to supercomputers in Europe. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-killed-translation-industry-easytranslate-boss-change-human-jobs/\"><strong><em>‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

Recent on-chain reports have revealed that liquid staking protocols have recorded a new milestone in the number of Ether (ETH) staked, reaching a staggering 12 million ETH mark in just a few days.  Ethereum Liquid Staking Gains Momentum With Ethereum 2.0 thriving, liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem have been growing rapidly despite recent market volatility. Research data from DeFi TVL aggregator, Defillama, revealed on Monday, September 25, the tremendous growth of Ethereum holdings in liquid staking platforms. According to the data, the ETH in liquid staking protocols has risen to approximately 12.31 million and may continue rising. Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High Reports uncovered that a staggering 370,000 ETH were staked in just five days, allowing liquid staking protocols to reach their current 12 million mark. Liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Coinbase, and Binance are among the list of prominent protocols that led to the recent upsurge in Ether staking.  According to Defillama TVL rankings, Lido holds the top spot for the amount of Ethereum staked with a TVL of $13.997 billion in liquid staking. The protocol secured over 8 million Ether on September 20, and another 30,000 after that. Lido Finance dominates ETH liquid staking &#124; Source: DeFiLlama Coinbase is presently ranked second in Defillama’s TVL rankings, holding approximately $2.155 billion, a significant gap from Lido’s TVL.  Coinbase has about 1.3 million Ether presently in its reserve. Whereas, Rocket Pool holds the third position in TVL rankings and has increased its Ether holdings from 940,496 to 945,402.  Binance Liquid Staking Platform Takes The Lead Binance liquid staking platform has been the driving force behind the recent spike in ether influx in liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem.  According to reports, Binance added a startling amount of ether to its already substantial ether reserves. The liquid staking platform which previously recorded 445,000 ETH in its reserve, added 318,605 ETH and now holds 764,105 ETH. Research data have revealed that Binance amassed a considerable amount of ETH tokens to support its staking token, Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH).
