Under the proposed rules crypto brokers would be required to use a new form to report to simplify tax filing and cut down on tax cheating. The proposed regulations include both centralized and some decentralized exchanges, crypto payment processors, and certain online wallets as crypto brokers.</p><p>The Treasury Department claimed that the new form would simplify the tax filing process as it would help taxpayers determine if they owe taxes rather than having to make complicated calculations or pay digital asset tax preparation services to file their tax returns. If approved, the new tax regime will come into effect from 2026 and the brokers will be required to start reporting 2025 transactions in January 2026 via Form 1099-DA.

Bitcoin should enable functionality that will boost the ability of second layers.”</blockquote><p>Lopp adds that any potential “hardcore ossification” that some maximalists have argued for in the past would have stifled innovation that led to the creation of solutions like the Lightning Network that has helped the Bitcoin network scale to better process transactions.</p><blockquote>“Lightning wouldn't really be possible without OP_CLTV. It would have maybe been possible, but really clunky without SegWit. And without OP_CSV, it would not be possible to have indefinitely long-lived Lightning channels.”</blockquote><p>Lopp was making reference to CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OP_CSV</a>) and CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OP_CLTV</a>), two BIPs that were carried out to facilitate payment channels as soft forks. OP_CLTV was authored by Todd, describing a Bitcoin operation code that allows a transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future.</p><p>Lopp adds that while Bitcoin’s protocol may become static due to a lack of consensus over base layer improvement proposals, developers are likely to keep building in ways that don’t require permissions:</p><blockquote>“If it's not possible to implement a solution that may be optimally implemented at the base layer at the base protocol, then generally what we see end up happening is solutions being kind of bolted-on in many cases.”</blockquote><p>The Casa CTO believes that if Bitcoin does not continue to scale, users will inevitably turn to storing and using BTC through a “handful of Bitcoin banks, aka custodians and exchanges”, which comes with significant trade-offs:</p><blockquote>“Then it's IOUs, right? That's not the future that I think any of us want to see.”</blockquote><p>As Cointelegraph <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-amsterdam-btc-shines-during-crypto-bear-market\">previously reported</a>, Bitcoin proponents and analysts at Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023 highlighted the growing importance of the cryptocurrency's value proposal and hard money characteristics amid a drawn-out bear market. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/recursive-inscriptions-bitcoin-supercomputer-defi-aws-possible/\"><strong><em>Magazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
