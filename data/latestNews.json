    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/520000-bitcoin-accumulated-at-30000-btc-bull-run/",
    "description": "A record 592,000 Bitcoin, or roughly $17.8 billion, was accumulated when the coin was trading at $30,200, recent Glassnode data indicates. At this accumulation rate, suggesting possible demand, more entities bought more coins at the second fastest pace in the network&#8217;s history. This record was only broken when 637,000 BTC were bought at an average price of $16,500. 592,000 Bitcoin Bought At $30,200 The spike in Bitcoin accumulated at this price point preceded the decision by a United States court to rule that XRP, an altcoin issued from the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is a commodity, just like Bitcoin. The ruling on Friday, July 14, was received positively by the crypto community and temporarily lifted prices, sustaining Bitcoin above the psychological $30,000 mark. According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted Economic Ratio Per Day (ERPD) is a metric designed to assess economic activity within the network, considering the number of entities participating. This metric is calculated by dividing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio by the entity-adjusted on-chain volume. In on-chain analysis, the NVT ratio represents the relationship between the market capitalization and the recorded on-chain trading volumes at a specific price point. A higher NVT ratio indicates a greater value than recorded trading volumes. Related Reading: Synthetix (SNX) Up By 35% In Anticipation Of New Decentralized Exchange While the NVT reading can be useful, it can also be misleading if the entities, or clustered addresses, involved in transactions are not accounted for. To correct this error, the ERPD integrates addresses involved at that price point, used in taking account of the market cap. This way, it can be easy to gauge the entities and total coins involved. Shifting Sentiment? The surge in Bitcoin ERPD development will also likely impact altcoins. Considering its liquidity and support across the board, Bitcoin sets the tone for other altcoins in crypto. Its performance and transactions can gauge market-wide sentiment, which might, in turn, change how altcoins are perceived in the current market conditions. Related Reading: Stablecoin TrueUSD To Be Fully Controlled By Asian Owner Still, some commentators on Twitter were unsure if the metric was a positive development or a position for further price crashes. One believes that most such transactions are conducted by &#8220;paper hands&#8221; who buy Bitcoin when the price increases and are set to sell at any moment of negative news. The spike in ERPD is also ahead of the Bitcoin halving event in 2024, which, reading on historical performances, may impact prices positively, even triggering a bull run. After halving, miners would receive fewer coins, releasing even fewer for circulation, a supply shock that may support prices. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
