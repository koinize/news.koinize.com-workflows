It notes in the filing:</p><blockquote>“On the back of intellectual property owned by Getty Images and other copyright holders, Stability AI has created an image-generating model called Stable Diffusion that uses artificial intelligence to deliver computer-synthesized images in response to text prompts.”</blockquote><p>While the European Commission and other regions are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-union-pushes-forward-with-first-ai-framework-law-decoded-april-24-may-1\">scrambling to develop regulations</a> to keep up with the rapid development of AI, the question of whether training AI models using copyrighted works classifies as an infringement may be decided in court cases such as this one.</p><p>The question is a hot topic, and in a May 16 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, United States Senator Marsha Blackburn grilled OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the issue.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xu0ldQSBhYc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>While Altman noted that “creators deserve control over how their creations are used,” he refrained from committing not to train ChatGPT to use copyrighted works without consent, instead suggesting that his firm was working with creators to ensure they are compensated in some way.</p><h3>AI companies argue “transformative use”</h3><p>AI companies generally argue that their models <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/midjourney-other-ai-devs-strike-back-in-court-claiming-their-material-is-not-similar-to-artists\">do not infringe on copyright laws</a> because they transform the original work, therefore qualifying as fair use — at least under U.S. laws.</p><p>“Fair use” is a doctrine in the U.S. that allows for limited use of copyrighted data without the need to acquire permission from the copyright holder.</p><p>Some of the key factors considered when determining whether the use of copyrighted material classifies as fair use include the purpose of the use — particularly, whether it’s being used for commercial gain — and whether it threatens the livelihood of the original creator by competing with their works.</p><h3>The Supreme Court’s Warhol opinion</h3><p>On May 18, the Supreme Court of the United States, considering these factors, issued an opinion that may play a significant role in the future of generative AI.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-869_87ad.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ruling</a> in <em>Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith</em> found that famous artist Andy Warhol’s 1984 work “Orange Prince” infringed on the rights of rock photographer Lynn Goldsmith, as the work was intended to be used commercially and, therefore, could not be covered by the fair use exemption.</p><p>While the ruling doesn’t change copyright law, it does clarify how transformative use is defined. </p><p>Mitch Glazier, chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America — a music advocacy organization — was thankful for the decision, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RIAA/status/1659266685931593750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noting</a> that “claims of ‘transformative use’ cannot undermine the basic rights given to all creators under the Copyright Act.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;We applaud the Supreme Court’s considered and thoughtful decision that claims of “transformative use” cannot undermine the basic rights given to all creators under the Copyright Act,” says RIAA Chairman &amp; CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitch_glazier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mitch_glazier</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/C5iTLr4Mk4\">https://t.co/C5iTLr4Mk4</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KMHyyXZTA3\">pic.twitter.com/KMHyyXZTA3</a></p>&mdash; RIAA (@RIAA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RIAA/status/1659266685931593750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Given that many AI companies are selling access to their AI models after training them using creators’ works, the argument that they are transforming the original works and therefore qualify for the fair use exemption may have been rendered ineffective by the decision.</p><p>It is worth noting that there is no clear consensus, however.</p><p>In a May 23 article, Jon Baumgarten — a former general counsel at the U.S. Copyright Office who participated in the formation of the Copyright Act — <a href=\"https://copyrightalliance.org/warns-assertions-ai-ingestion-is-fair-use/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> the case highlights that the question of fair use depends on many factors and argued that the current general counsel’s blanket assertion that generative AI is fair use “is over-generalized, oversimplified and unduly conclusory.”</p><h3>A safer path?</h3><p>The legal question marks surrounding generative AI models trained using copyrighted works have prompted some firms to heavily restrict the data going into their models.</p><p>For example, on May 23, software firm Adobe announced the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blizzard-adobe-generative-ai-tools\">launch of a generative AI model</a> called Generative Fill, which allows Photoshop users to “create extraordinary imagery from a simple text prompt.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/44f44254-84c4-43fd-b452-2f04c6eddc00.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of Generative Fill’s capabilities. Source: </em><em>Adobe</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the product is similar to Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, the AI model powering Generative Fill is trained using only stock photos from its own database, which — according to Adobe — helps <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/generative-fill.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ensure</a> it “won’t generate content based on other people’s work, brands, or intellectual property.”<em></em></p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/microsoft-urges-ai-artificial-intelligence-regulation-guardrails\"><strong>Microsoft urges lawmakers, companies to ‘step up’ with AI guardrails</strong></a></em></p><p>This may be the safer path from a legal perspective, but AI models are only as good as the data fed into them, so ChatGPT and other popular AI tools would not be as accurate or useful as they are today if they had not scraped vast amounts of data from the web.</p><p>So, while creators might be emboldened by the recent Warhol decision — and there is no question that their works should be protected by copyright law — it is worth considering what its broader effect might be.</p><p>If generative AI models can only be trained using copyright-free data, what kind of effect will that have on innovation and productivity growth? </p><p>After all, productivity growth is considered by many to be the single most significant contributor to raising the standard of living for a country’s citizens, as <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sdd/productivity-stats/40526851.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">highlighted</a> in a famous quote from prominent economist Paul Krugman in his 1994 book <em>The Age of Diminished Expectations</em>:</p><blockquote>“Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.

    "description": "<p>Republican congressman Warren Davidson has stated that a tentative deal aimed at stopping the US government from defaulting on its debts potentially scuppers a proposed 30% crypto mining tax.&nbsp;</p>\nUS Looks To Avoid Default&nbsp;\n<p>United States lawmakers had, on the 28th of May, 2023, released a draft of the &ldquo;Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023&rdquo; bill. The bill allows the government to increase the debt ceiling following long negotiations between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The debt ceiling is a limit on how much debt can be incurred by the Treasury Department. The proposed legislation still requires congressional approval before it can take effect and help the United States of America avoid a national default. A national default would be nothing short of an economic catastrophe for the US government.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed bill would suspend the debt ceiling for two years, allowing the US government to continue to borrow money and settle its outstanding debts. President Joe Biden had pressed for the deal to include several tax increases for corporations and high-income individuals. However, the draft suggests that such taxes were highly unlikely to be implemented.&nbsp;</p>\n30% Crypto Tax Blocked?&nbsp;\n<p>Congressman Davidson took to Twitter to discuss the proposed bill and, in a relief to the crypto ecosystem in the US, stated that it blocked several proposed taxes. This included the proposed 30% tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency miners, which many feared would be part of President Biden&rsquo;s FY2024 budget. If the proposed crypto tax passes, cryptocurrency miners could potentially face a 10% tax increase each year for the next three years starting in 2024. In a discussion on Twitter, Congressman Davidson called the blocking of proposed taxes a small victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following the negotiations, President Biden, in an address to the press, stated,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The agreement represents a compromise, which means no one got everything they wanted. The Speaker and I made clear from the start that the only way forward is with a bipartisan agreement. This agreement is an important step forward, and now it will go to the United States House and Senate. The agreement prevents the worst possible crisis, a default, for the first time in our nation&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Many stakeholders in the cryptocurrency space have criticized the US government and those supporting the 30% crypto tax. This criticism had arisen long before the issue of debt default came into the picture. Several prominent voices from the crypto ecosystem have hailed the debt ceiling bill.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, the United States government still has a lot of work to do regarding the debt default deadline, which is looming and expected to hit in June. While the bipartisan agreement is indicative of lawmakers attempting to move forward, the bill still has to go through a hugely divided House of Representatives, with several Republican lawmakers openly hostile to Speaker McCarthy. Voting on the legislation is expected to take place on the 31st of May.&nbsp;</p>\nCrypto&rsquo;s Growing Appeal&nbsp;\n<p>Many US states have opened their doors for crypto miners to set up operations in their jurisdiction. In April, Arkansas announced that it was joining Texas and Montana to propose legislation that would ensure that Bitcoin mining firms were protected under the law. Furthermore, shares of Riot Platforms have seen an increase of nearly 80% since the 1st of March. Marathon Digital has reported an increase of over 37% in the same period.</p>\nThe Digital Asset Mining Energy Excise Tax\n<p>The Biden administration had proposed the Digital Asset Mining Energy excise tax (DAME) as part of its budget for the fiscal year 2024. The proposal sought to impose a tax equal to 30% of the total cost of electricity consumed during operations. However, the proposed bill saw significant pushback from the cryptocurrency community, with even Democrats critical of the bill. United States presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr called the bill a bad idea and publicly aligned with the crypto community. Senator Cynthia Lummis also vehemently opposed the bill and told the audience at the Bitcoin 2023 conference that the tax would not happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;America must welcome innovation, and digital assets are the future of financial innovation. A 30% tax hike on any specific industry is a blatant attempt by the administration to pick winners and losers. I will not let President Biden tax the digital asset industry out of existence.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
