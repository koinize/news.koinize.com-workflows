However, the GOPs pro-crypto bias may also be its downfall. From uncritical crypto maximalism to Orwellian surveillance paranoia, Web3s industry bromides have crept into the partys campaign rhetoric and, worse, its policy proposals. In seminal upcoming legislative opportunities, such as the Houses draft crypto regulatory bill, Republican policymakers must focus on putting America first.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><h2 id=\"h-memeified-campaign-rhetoric\">Memeified campaign rhetoric</h2><p>During his presidential campaign announcement in May, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis insisted that the current regime, clearly, has it out for Bitcoin.

However, the influence of the crypto industrys memeified rhetoric is evident even in the partys innermost policy-making circles.  </p><p>Take, for example, the Digital Assets Market Structure (DAMS) bill. The watershed draft legislation, penned in part by McHenrys committee, marks Congresss most credible proposed regulatory framework for crypto to date. While, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/republican-crypto-bill-10x-improvement-messari-ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >as Messari CEO Ryan Selkis said</a>, DAMS is a 10x improvement over past bills, it still falls short of bringing regulatory clarity to the industry.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Warren-1024x880.jpg\" alt=\"Anti Crypto\" class=\"wp-image-20986\" width=\"521\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Warren-1024x880.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Warren-300x258.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Warren-770x662.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Warren.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Elizabeth Warren is a builder, not a hodler. (Twitter)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the proposed bill does more to regulate Web3 as crypto natives imagine it to be than as the industry operates today. In keeping with Republicans long-standing preference, DAMS conceives of crypto assets primarily as digital commodities to be overseen by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Indeed, the bill paves a clear path for CFTC compliance.</p><p>Theres one catch: To qualify as a digital commodity, according to DAMS, each network to which the digital asset relates [must be] certified to be [] decentralized, which requires that no single person has the unilateral authority, directly or indirectly, [] to materially alter the protocol or to prohibit any person [from] deploying software that uses or integrates with the blockchain network.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-2022-will-real-btc-maximalists-please-stand-up/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Bitcoin 2022  Will the real maximalists please stand up?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/powers-on-top-crypto-legal-regulatory-developments-2021/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Powers On… Top 5 crypto legal and regulatory developments of 2021</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>In other words, much of the more than 160-page draft bill only applies, with any certainty, to two digital assets: Bitcoin and Ether. Meanwhile, protocols with any level of centralized operations (read: most) remain under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though an improvement on the status quo, the path to SEC compliance under DAMS is comparatively convoluted.</p><h2 id=\"h-america-first-crypto-laws\">America-first crypto laws</h2><p>The GOP may soon have a shot at defining Americas crypto policy. Now is not the time to succumb to partisan talking points or industry bromides. Lawmakers must clearly assess Web3 as it exists today so that the U.S. can unlock its benefits for decades to come.</p><p>As a first step, Republicans must bury the half-baked notion that crypto is antagonistic to the traditional financial system. They also must overcome their aversion to the SEC. In fact, Web3 and TradFi are deeply compatible, and Americas gold-standard security laws are a feature, not a bug. In the near term, policymakers should create clear SEC exemptions for digital assets so nascent U.S. protocols can get off the ground. Longer-term, officials should embrace <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-is-going-to-transform-investing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >blockchains enormous potential</a> to enhance the United States regulated financial sector.</p><p>Most importantly, U.S. officials must recognize that extending dollar dominance to Web3 is a strategic imperative. Forget about blockchain as an alternative to the dollar; it is a potent tool for extending Americas economic reach. Republicans should lead the charge.</p><p>The Houses latest draft stablecoin bill is a good start and underscores McHenrys policy chops in Web3, but lawmakers can do more. That includes <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-us-should-promote-usdc-before-it-s-too-late\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >supporting Circle Internet Financial</a>, the issuer of USDC. In the Senate, Republicans should emulate Roger Marshall by working with crypto-savvy Democrats, including Warren, to draft industry-friendly KYC and AML rules. </p><p>Crypto doesnt need to be a scam against the dollar. It can be a powerful strategic asset, but only if U.S. crypto policy truly puts America first.</p><p><em>This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-plunges-1700-metric-signaled-in-advance/",
    "description": "Ethereum has plunged below $1,700 during the past day. Here&#8217;s the on-chain indicator that may have signaled this dip in advance. Ethereum Age Consumed Metric Saw A Spike Before The Price Decline According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional investors look to have been expecting the move to take place. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;ETH age consumed,&#8221; which first finds the total number of coins moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Then it multiplies this value by the days these coins had been dormant before their movement. So, in this way, the metric keeps track of how many coins are being sold/moved each day and uses their age as a weighting factor. This means that many old coins are moved to the network whenever this indicator&#8217;s value is high. Naturally, low values of the metric, on the other hand, would imply that there aren&#8217;t many coins moving on the chain right now or some coins with a low average age are being transferred. Related Reading: XRP And Ethereum Seeing Increased Social Media Talk As Bitcoin Loses Interest Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum age consumed over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum age consumed metric had recently registered a very large spike. This would suggest the potential movement of many dormant coins on the chain during this surge. Generally, when such large spikes in the indicator are observed, it&#8217;s a sign of selling from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort includes all the investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. These holders are the experienced hands in the market who don&#8217;t easily sell even when the market is distressed. Because of this reason, their movements can be something to watch out for, as when they do finally sell, it&#8217;s usually not a positive sign for the price. The chart shows that the LTHs had also shown a large move earlier in the month. Shortly after these investors became active, the cryptocurrency price plunged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Social Media Now Most Red Since COVID Crash, Bottom Signal? This time, the spike in the Ethereum age consumed also seems to have preceded a price decline, as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value has now dropped below the $1,700 level. This latest price plunge has come after the news that the US Federal Reserve isn&#8217;t raising interest rates this time, but more hikes would be coming later in the year to fight inflation. Santiment suggests that the spike in the age consumed metric before the price decline could imply that the institutions already expected the move, hence why they shifted their coins early. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,600, down 11% in the last week. ETH has taken a plunge recently &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
