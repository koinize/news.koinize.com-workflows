This is the beginning now through the courts, unfortunately instead of through regulators, to get that clarity and get us back in the game.”</blockquote><p>Larsen also commented on the latest court judgment in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-court-battle-what-does-this-mean-for-spot-bitcoin-etf\">favor of Grayscale</a> over its application to convert its Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, noting it “really admonished the SEC [...] in a way that you don't really see very often.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I sincerely hope we’re seeing the beginning of the end of the SEC’s policy of regulation by enforcement. The Courts are rejecting it, and now it’s time for Congress to take the lead on crypto policy.<br><br>Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdLudlow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EdLudlow</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/technology?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@technology</a> for the chat! <a href=\"https://t.co/3gZOR4lq5J\">https://t.co/3gZOR4lq5J</a></p>&mdash; Chris Larsen (@chrislarsensf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislarsensf/status/1699545784063303873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 6, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Larsen argued the ruling was proof that SEC chair <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/gary-gensler\">Gary Gensler</a> knows crypto laws aren’t clear and simply likes the lack of clarity so “he can go after anybody and make up the rules as he goes along through bullying.”</p><blockquote>“That's not the American way. We should have clear rules from the legislatures, not through these unelected, power-hungry and really misplaced decision-makers that you see in Gary Gensler.”</blockquote><p>Gensler has however <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gary-gensler-crypto-market-is-like-1920s-stock-market-full-of-fraudsters\">previously claimed</a> that the crypto market is full of “fraudsters” and “Ponzi schemes” and that the SEC’s securities laws would help to clean it up.</p><h3>Biden ‘killed’ San Fran blockchain hub</h3><p>In another part of the interview, Larsen claimed Biden’s crypto policies “pretty much killed” <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-city-guide-san-francisco-bay-area/\">San Francisco</a> from being the “blockchain capital of the world” despite Silicon Valley’s tech hub reputation.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-asks-sec-meet-for-bitcoin-etf-conversion\"><strong><em>Grayscale asks SEC to meet on ‘way forward’ for Bitcoin ETF conversion</em></strong></a></p><p>“We owned it and we don't anymore because the Biden administration, for whatever reason, decided they wanted to push this industry offshore,” Larsen added.</p><blockquote>“That was a missed opportunity. It's really unfortunate. Hurt the city.”</blockquote><p>He pointed to London, Singapore and Dubai as global blockchain capitals for their “clear rules that protect consumers and also celebrate innovation.”</p><p>“Why isn't America leading that call?” Larsen asked. “That's what we've always been, and we've got to get back to it.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/opinion-republican-crypto-maxis-democrat-anti-crypto-army-mchenry-warren/\"><strong><em>Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Ripple’s token price is holding the $0.485 support against the US Dollar. XRP price could start a recovery wave if it clears $0.510 and $0.525. Ripple’s token price is struggling to recover above $0.510 and $0.525 against the US dollar. The price is now trading below $0.520 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line in place with resistance near $0.5020 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it stays below $0.525 in the short term. Ripple’s Token Price Eyes Recovery In the past few days, Ripple’s XRP saw a steady decline from the $0.550 resistance against the US Dollar. The price declined below the $0.532 and $0.525 support levels. It even spiked below the $0.500 support. A low is formed near $0.4863 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5490 swing high to the $0.4863 low. XRP is now trading below $0.520 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is also trading near a major bearish trend line in place with resistance near $0.5020 on the 4-hour chart. Initial resistance on the upside is near the $0.502 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $0.518 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5490 swing high to the $0.4863 low. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The main resistance is forming near $0.525. A successful break above the $0.525 resistance level might send the price toward the $0.532 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $0.550 resistance. Another Drop in XRP? If ripple fails to clear the $0.525 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.490 zone. The next major support is at $0.485. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.485 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.450 support zone. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.490, $0.485, and $0.450. Major Resistance Levels – $0.518, $0.520, and $0.550."
