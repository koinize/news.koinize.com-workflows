Over the course of the past 2 days, the platform has witnessed more than $3.26 million in total trading volume and a little over 462,000 transactions, according to <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/dapp/stars-arena?range-ha=7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data</a> from DappRadar. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/57ea62e3-fe35-4ffb-b6cb-a9d57735f490.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Stars Arena has grown rapidly since its launch in late-September.

This however, still pales in comparison to Friend.tech, which commands some $44.27 million in TVL. </p><p>Like Friend.tech, Star Arena lets users link their Twitter accounts to the platform. Users then use the AVAX token to purchase “tickets” of other users, with a small cut of fees being paid to the platform itself and the users when tickets are bought and sold. </p><p>While purchasing a users’ ticket provides users with access to a private chat — unlike Friend.tech, Stars Arena features a public feed, so users can follow others without needing to front up large sums of money. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/friend-tech-decentralized-social-media-onboarding-problem\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/friend-tech-decentralized-social-media-onboarding-problem/amp\"><strong><em>Decentralized social networks have a retention problem, say execs</em></strong></a></p><p>Pseudonymous X user Wale.swoosh described Stars Arena as “superior to Friend.tech in a lot of ways” — with its public feed feature allowing users to be more social than they would on the Base-based DeSo app. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I've capitulated in creating a Stars Arena account after seeing it all over my timeline.<br><br>Won't shill my own ref link, but a few thoughts:<br><br>Stars Arena is superior to Friendtech in a lot of ways and solves one of the main problems I had with FT.<br><br>There is a public feed, so people… <a href=\"https://t.co/S9KzPp3hqC\">pic.twitter.com/S9KzPp3hqC</a></p>— wale.swoosh  (@waleswoosh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waleswoosh/status/1709530638972280905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Still, Wale.swoosh and a number of others users across X noted that that the application was still quite buggy, with chats being “very laggy” and drew attention to the lack of information on the team behind the application. </p><p>Stars Arena is the latest app to join a growing roster of social finance platforms such as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/friend-tech-look-alike-alpha-bitcoin-network\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/friend-tech-look-alike-alpha-bitcoin-network/amp\">Alpha on the Bitcoin network</a>, Friendzy on Solana and PostTech on Arbitrum.
