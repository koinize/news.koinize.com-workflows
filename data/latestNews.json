    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-6-altcoins-crypto-ethereum-dencun-upgrade/",
    "description": "As the Ethereum ecosystem braces for the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher provides an in-depth look at the altcoins poised for significant growth. Scheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade is a critical hard fork aimed at enhancing Ethereum&#8217;s scalability, security, and usability. Deutscher&#8217;s insights reveal how specific Layer 2 (L2) solutions are uniquely positioned to benefit from the upgrade&#8217;s introduction of Proto-Danksharding and other key enhancements. Deutscher explains, &#8220;The Dencun upgrade, especially with EIP-4844, represents a paradigm shift in how Ethereum will handle transactions. By drastically lowering gas fees and increasing throughput, we&#8217;re looking at a more accessible, efficient blockchain.&#8221; This upgrade is part of Ethereum&#8217;s broader roadmap, known as &#8220;The Surge,&#8221; focusing on scalability improvements. Top-6 Altcoins To Watch Prior To Dencun #1 Polygon (MATIC/POL): With its impending rebrand and investment in zk-technology, Polygon is at a pivotal juncture. Deutscher notes, &#8220;Polygon&#8217;s deep dive into zk-rollups could redefine its position in the L2 landscape, making MATIC an attractive asset for forward-looking investors.&#8221; Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Buys $187 Million ETH In 3-Day Spree, Anticipating Further Surge? #2 Arbitrum (ARB): As the leading L2 by TVL and transaction volume, Arbitrum&#8217;s robustness is undisputed. &#8220;Arbitrum has cemented its position as a powerhouse in the L2 space, and the Dencun upgrade will only amplify its strengths,&#8221; Deutscher remarks. #3 Optimism (OP): Positioned as a strong contender in the L2 space, Optimism&#8217;s ecosystem is set to expand. &#8220;The announcement of Optimism&#8217;s fourth airdrop is not just a reward for its community but a strategic move to bolster its ecosystem&#8217;s vibrancy,&#8221; says Deutscher. #4 COTI Network (COTI): With the launch of V2 and its innovative &#8216;Garbled Circuits,&#8217; COTI introduces a groundbreaking privacy solution. Deutscher observes, &#8220;COTI&#8217;s approach to privacy on the blockchain through &#8216;Garbled Circuits&#8217; is a game-changer, potentially setting a new standard for private transactions.&#8221; Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tops $3,000, But ‘Is Completely Detached From Reality’: Expert #5 Mantle (MNT): Highlighting Mantle&#8217;s rapid growth, Deutscher points out, &#8220;With $1.5 billion in ETH now staked as mETH, Mantle is not just growing; it&#8217;s thriving, supported by strategic airdrops that reward its community.&#8221; #6 Metis (METIS): Identified as a potentially undervalued project, Metis&#8217;s upcoming initiatives are a beacon for investors. &#8220;Metis&#8217;s decentralized sequencer and the substantial METIS Ecosystem Fund are laying the groundwork for a robust, decentralized future, making it an intriguing prospect post-Dencun,&#8221; Deutscher explains. Broader Implications For Ethereum Deutscher also casts a spotlight on Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea as projects to watch, emphasizing the widespread impact of the Dencun upgrade. He advises, &#8220;The ETH/L2 trade is increasingly compelling as we approach the Dencun upgrade. Shifting a significant portion of one&#8217;s portfolio into the Ethereum ecosystem seems prudent, given the transformative potential of the upcoming changes.&#8221; At press time, ETH still traded just below the $3,000 mark.
