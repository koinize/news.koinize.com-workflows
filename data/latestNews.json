Eighteen leading venture capital (VC) investment firms, including Temasek, Sequoia Capital, Sino Global and Softbank, have been named defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for their links to the exchange.

According to Deputy Merlong Solano, the revision seeks to promote equal tax treatment since crypto investments abroad currently receive lower tax breaks.</p><p>Overseas earnings up to 6,000 Brazilian reais (~$1,200) will be exempt from taxation under the new rules.

Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what &lsquo;Real Magic&rsquo; is all about.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Masterpiece NFT collection showcases the artwork featured in the brand&rsquo;s campaign, including Andy Warhol&rsquo;s iconic 1962 Coca‑Cola painting, classical pieces of timeless artists such as Edvard Munch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&rdquo;, as well as works of emerging artists such as Aket, Fatma Ramadan, and Vikram Kushwah.</p>\nCoinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer\n<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s new NFT collection has been offered for a limited time and presented as a part of the Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer event:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;@CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists,&rdquo; Coinbase announced on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Onchain Summer is Coinbase's month-long celebration of its Layer-2 Blochcian Base which became available to the general public on August 9. Each day, the festival offers numerous onchain mints, stories, and activities related to art, culture, music, gaming, and more. Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand presented on the list of Base&rsquo;s partners so far.</p>\nCoca-Cola and NFTs\n<p>This is not the first time the world-renowned soft drinks brand has ventured into the NFT space. Back in 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned off exclusive NFT collectibles with the aim of raising funds for Special Olympics International. At that time, the first Coca-Cola&rsquo;s NFT loot box was sold as a single asset for over $575,000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s engagement with NFTs is meaningful for the whole cryptocurrency industry. As one of the largest global consumer brands, Coca-Cola could introduce many of its customers to the world of digital art and Web3. Besides, the beverage giant will likely play a big role in promoting Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network Base.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/maker-large-holders-accumulate-mkr-rally-continue/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows large Maker holders have accumulated recently, a sign that the rally could extend soon. Maker Large Holders Have Continued To Expand Their Holdings Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, inflows to the wallets of the large MKR investors have been taking place for a while now. The &#8220;large holders&#8221; here refer to those investors who hold at least 0.1% of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply. In Maker&#8217;s case, this value would equal about $1.2 million. Thus, the only holders who would clear these criteria would be the sharks and whales, the largest entities on the network. These investors generally hold some influence in the market, as they can move many tokens at once. Thus, the behavior of this cohort could be worth watching, as it may reveal answers about where the asset might be heading next. One way to track the behavior of these humongous holders is through the &#8220;netflow&#8221; metric, which measures the net amount of MKR that these large investors are adding into or moving out of their combined holdings right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that a net number of coins is entering into the supply of these investors currently, suggesting that they are participating in buying. On the other hand, negative values could imply that this group may be selling as its members are transferring a net amount of the asset away from their wallets. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Maker large holders netflow over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been positive in recent days &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock on X The above graph shows that the Maker large holders&#8217; netflow has been almost entirely positive during the past few months. There were a few dips into the negative territory, but the net outflows weren&#8217;t significant in scale then. In the past few weeks, there haven&#8217;t been any drops below the zero mark, suggesting that the large holders have only continued accumulating more MKR recently. Something to note here is that a positive netflow doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t any selling taking place at all. Instead, it simply suggests that the accumulation is enough to cancel any distribution. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? In the past couple of months, the cryptocurrency has seen an overall uptrend, which could be a consequence of the net buying these investors have been participating in. Since this month has started, though, the asset has declined. Nonetheless, as the netflows have only remained positive throughout this decline, the large holders have been buying regardless. This conviction from these large holders can naturally be a positive sign for Maker, as the asset could potentially continue its rally soon. MKR Price At the time of writing, Maker is trading around $1,200, up 4% in the last week. Looks like the value of the asset has been moving sideways recently &#124; Source: MKRUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com"
