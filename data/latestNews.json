No longer are people just using the umbrella term artificial intelligence — they are saying narrow AI, superintelligence and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Companies are using the terms machine learning and deep learning when explaining the technologies they have incorporated to streamline their business practices.</p><p>The push to advance AI started long before the conversation about it did, and those advancements have benefited businesses across industries. The potential for what the future holds with this technology has been particularly enthralling for those in the Web3 space. </p><p>Irina Jadallah, co-founder of Ticketmeta — a nonfungible token-based ticketing solution and decentralized streaming service for sports events — told Cointelegraph:</p><blockquote>“AI is fast becoming the biggest news of the century. From ChatGPT to Siri to Alexa and a million other AI apps and tools, virtually everything around us is influenced by AI, including the metaverse [...] It has the potential to revolutionize the way we engage with and enjoy virtual worlds by facilitating more natural and intuitive interactions between users and virtual surroundings.”</blockquote><p>But the impact of AI does not stop with the metaverse; it has already been proven that AI has the potential to revolutionize various fields, from marketing to finance. As exciting as it may be, the popularity of this technology, as Jadallah pointed out, now poses a rather significant question. </p><p>As it becomes more advanced and more desired by the public, it also becomes more expensive, enhancing the risk of centralization. This collective concern has created a new buzzword — decentralized AI.</p><h2>Centralization vs. decentralization</h2><p>As with all things, centralization is not inherently a bad thing, but it does pose some issues where AI is concerned. </p><p>When only a small number of organizations can afford to use the technology, they would be able to control how the technology advances, risking it becoming everything many people fear it to be.</p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinese-police-web3-blockchain-centralization-continues-asia-express/\">Chinese police vs. Web3, blockchain centralization continues: Asia Express</a></em></strong></p><p>This concern of centralized AI is one that many in the space are already discussing and working against. Marcello Mari, founder of SingularityDAO — an asset management company that uses AI for trading strategies — told Cointelegraph:</p><blockquote>“If we keep developing artificial intelligence behind closed doors — by corporations that use it for marketing, military or centralized finance, which basically means killing people more efficiently, selling you stuff you don’t need, and making the rich richer — then the next artificial intelligence will probably reflect those same kinds of values, right?” </blockquote><p>In contrast, decentralized AI could allow individuals to have more of a say in the products they use while having a broader range of models to choose from.</p><p>“This is why we even founded our company back in 2017 because it’s very important that we start thinking now about what the next AGI or superhuman intelligence will look like,” said Mari. “In order to make it benevolent, you want to have a decentralized layer so that the community can actually influence and be comfortable with the development of AGI.”</p><p>Decentralized AI could incorporate blockchain technology, which already has a reputation for security and transparency. </p><p>“Blockchain technology is a safe and open system for monitoring information and ensuring it stays unaltered,” said Anna Ivanchenko, co-founder and CEO of Ticketmeta. “It’s used to create credibility and trust.”</p><p>People have a preference for public blockchains because they are often governed by the community and not a central authority. Code becomes law and adds a level of trustlessness that is not seen in other industries. According to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CoinGecko</a>, there are already more than 50 blockchain-based AI companies, with many people expecting this number to grow exponentially over the coming years. Companies such as Render, Fetch.ai and SingularityNET have led the charge in 2023.</p><p>Mari’s SingularityDAO is democratically governed by the community, who can have input into how their AI-DeFi model operates. People having a say is the main differentiating factor between centralized and decentralized AI. With centralized AI, the average user has negligible influence over how the AI models function.</p><p>Encouraging the community to take part in the development and direction of AI, allowing them to influence where it goes and what it does, will likely play a significant role in easing their concerns. Decentralized AI could very well make people more comfortable with AI as a whole, easing the transition of the technology into one that we use every day.</p><p>Of course, it’s never easy with new tech, and decentralized AI is no exception. It shares a common challenge with centralized AI, namely the “black box” problem, which involves a lack of transparency in how AI models operate and reach conclusions. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/7378f68c-63d2-4681-920e-50fa64854353.png\"  alt=\"AI, Decentralization\"  title=\"The crucial role of decentralization in shaping AI&rsquo;s future\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>No one is sure what happens in the black box. Source: Investopedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>This opacity can understandably breed distrust. However, as Cointelegraph recently highlighted, there is hope: Explainable AI (XAI) and open-source models are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-s-black-box-problem-challenges-and-solutions-for-a-transparent-future\">emerging as promising avenues to address the black box issue</a> in decentralized AI.</p><h2>Benefits of decentralized AI </h2><p>Decentralized AI enhances security in several ways. For example, by leveraging blockchain technology, it offers encryption and immutability, ensuring that data remains both secure and unchanged. </p><p>It can proactively detect anomalies or suspicious patterns in data, acting as an early warning system against potential breaches. The need for decentralization arises from its inherent design: Instead of having a single point of vulnerability, data is distributed across multiple nodes, making unauthorized access or tampering significantly more challenging. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-grammys-recording-academy-ceo-harvey-mason-jr\">AI can be a ‘creative amplifier’ — Grammy chief exec Harvey Mason Jr.</a></em></strong></p><p>Decentralized AI is championing the cause of transparency and trust in a world that’s becoming more data-driven by the day. Traditional AI systems often suffer from opaque decision-making processes, raising trust and accountability issues. However, decentralized AI systems, like SingularityNET, stand out with their inherent transparency, recording every transaction and decision on the blockchain. </p><p>Despite still being in its infancy, decentralized AI provides hope of solving the aforementioned “black box” issue because of the inherent transparency that comes with blockchain technology.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "<p>A currency swap with the PBoC together with a loan from the Development Bank of Latin America helps Argentine central bank to meet $3.7 billion obligation to IMF.</p>\nIMF enslavement\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established after the Bretton Woods agreement, and since then has provided loans to developing countries, however some have pointed out that the loans have served to export the dollar and enslave countries with repayments rather than help them to develop.</p>\n<p>Argentina is one of the most indebted countries in the world, having defaulted many times in its torrid financial history. The latest default avoidance was made possible by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China stepping in and providing the means for Argentina to meet its IMF obligation by way of $1.7 billion in yuan currency swaps.</p>\n<p>According to the South China Morning Post, the intervention of the PBoC and the Latin American Development Bank has only succeeded in buying time for Argentina. Ariel Gonzalez Levaggi of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina was quoted by the SCMP as saying &ldquo;it does not provide a viable way out for Argentina.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However, it does mean that for now Argentina does not have to dip into any of its dollar reserves, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been adequate with which to pay the debt and would have placed the country in an extremely precarious situation.</p>\nFurther encroachment into dollar hegemony\n<p>This recent move by China is seen by many as an attempt to undermine the use of the US dollar for debt settlement, and another nail in the coffin of de-dollarisation. Alexandre Coelho of the International Political Science Association, and former legal advisor to the Bank of China said on the matter:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Although the renminbi has been part of the IMF currency basket since 2016, its use for debt settlement is not common. The path chosen by Argentina sets a precedent and may, in the future, be adopted by other emerging countries in a similar situation,&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As the BRICS countries prepare for their summit later this month, and a potential announcement of a rumoured gold-backed currency to rival the dollar reserve currency, the US domination of global finances could certainly be slackening.&nbsp;</p>\nBitcoin - the last hope for world citizens\n<p>In addition, the IMF&rsquo;s scathing view of El Salvador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin as a joint legal currency with the dollar while at the same time exacting a promise from the Argentine central bank to steer clear of Bitcoin as a requirement for payment of its loan looks to be patronising and a form of bullying.</p>\n<p>The global financial system is changing, and whether the good will of China is actually that, and not just a way of usurping monetary power from the US in order to achieve its own world domination remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>This is probably the likely scenario, and therefore Bitcoin is still potentially the only way out of super power domination for the world&rsquo;s citizens. A currency/store of value such as Bitcoin, that has no government or politics backing it, remains an extremely attractive proposition.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As part of the report, the company shared its XRP holdings as of March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023.  Ripple’s XRP Holdings Ripple revealed that its XRP holdings fall into two categories; wallet-held XRPs and ones in escrow lockups (Ripple releases one billion XRP monthly as part of its monthly token unlock). As of March 31, 2023 (representing the first quarter of the year), Ripple held  5,506,585,918 XRP and a further 42,800,000,013 XRP subject to on-ledger escrow.  Related Reading: Over $28 Million In SHIB Withdrawn From Exchanges Ahead Of Shibarium Launch Meanwhile, as of June 30, 2023 (representing the second quarter of the year), the company held 5,551,119,094 XRP, and a further 41,900,000,005 XRP were subject to on-ledger escrow.  From the report, Ripple grew its XRP holdings in Q2 as the Q2 figures are slightly up from the Q1 figures. However, its XRP tokens in escrow at the end of Q2 slightly reduced compared to the Q1 figure.  XRP price still holding $0.69 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Ripple Addresses Popular Misconceptions Ripple also addressed some misconceptions from the recent court ruling that XRP isn’t a security. On July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in the ongoing case between the crypto company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The first misconception Ripple addressed in the report was whether or not the ruling was a split decision, as several media outlets had tagged Ripple’s victory again the SEC as a ‘partial victory.’ The crypto firm has debunked this claim by categorically stating that the ruling isn’t a split decision.  Ripple stated that the ruling was a big win for its firm and the crypto industry as it provides regularity clarity not only for Ripple but also to other token issuers, as they can now determine that their tokens, in and out of themselves, are not securities.  Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says The company also stated in the report that its XRP tokens were never a security. It admitted that there are instances where XRP (just like “an orange grove or a gold bar”) can be sold as an investment contract. However, such events don’t “magically transform” the token into a security.  Ripple’s XRP enjoyed a significant rally following the court’s ruling, but there remain concerns that an appeal from the SEC could see the token lose most of its gains from the post-lawsuit rally. As of the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.69, according to data from CoinGeko. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
