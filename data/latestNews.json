It forms when the price forms three peaks atop a common neckline support; the middle peak, called \"head,\" is higher than the other two, called the \"left shoulder\" and \"right shoulder.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/50c74807-4502-4b3e-819f-a730fa7a84c0.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Head-and-shoulder breakdown illustrated. Source: Forex Academy</em></figcaption></figure><p>The H&S pattern resolves after the price breaks below its neckline. Meanwhile, as a rule of technical analysis, traders measure the pattern's downside target by adding the maximum distance between the head and neckline to the breakdown point.</p><p>On May 22, PEPE broke below its H&S neckline near $0.00000156. That puts its downside target near $0.00000041 in June, down around 70% from current price levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/98b9a5bc-5dc3-4792-9cb7-f7d08f1d5bdc.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>PEPE/USDT four-hour price chart.

This level, down about 30% from current price levels, served as support in early May; it further coincides with PEPE's 0.786 Fib line.</p><p>On the other hand, the breakdown scenario will risk invalidation if the PEPE price reclaims the H&S neckline as support.</p><h2>Will existing PEPE holders dump?</h2><p>Despite its recent losses, PEPE still trades 4,000% higher when measured from its exchange debut price of $0.00000044.
