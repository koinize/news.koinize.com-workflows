More precisely, the ratio for OKX top traders declined to 0.78 on June 8 after peaking at 1.08 on June 7.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/matic-price-shows-bullish-formation-whats-next/",
    "description": "MATIC has experienced a downward trend over the past few months, but there is a possibility of a reversal. In the last 24 hours, the altcoin attempted a slight 0.2% increase, but the weekly chart showed a 13% depreciation, indicating a strong bearish dominance from a technical standpoint. Both demand and accumulation indicators were negative, despite some buying strength attempting to recover. As Bitcoin surged above the $26,000 mark, many altcoins, including MATIC, are also attempting to move upward on their respective charts. Related Reading: “XRP Very Important,” Top Analyst Predicts Which Tokens Could Profit From The SEC War However, for the altcoin to reverse its price action, it is crucial for Bitcoin to maintain a price above $26,000. Additionally, buying strength needs to enter the market during the immediate trading sessions. MATIC faces an important overhead resistance level that it must surpass in order to experience a significant rally. The decline in MATIC&#8217;s market capitalization indicates a low buying strength on the chart. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.77, which is close to its multi-month low of $0.75, recorded 6 months ago. The coin is facing overhead resistance at $0.80, and if it manages to break past that level, it might attempt to reach $0.93. Notably, the coin has formed a descending wedge pattern, which is typically associated with a bullish price reversal. In the event of an upside breakout, MATIC could potentially rally as high as $1.50. However, there is a possibility that the altcoin may find support at the $0.76 level. Failing to remain above this level could result in MATIC trading below the $0.74 price mark. It is worth noting that the amount of MATIC traded in the last session was low, indicating a higher selling strength on the chart. Technical Analysis Following the rejection at the $0.84 resistance level, buyers have lost confidence in MATIC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits below the half-line and below the 30-mark, indicating that the coin is oversold at the moment. Additionally, the price of the coin has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This suggested low demand and sellers driving the price momentum. However, if MATIC makes an attempt to rise above the $0.84 mark, it could attract renewed demand and bring back the bulls. This would increase the likelihood of a further rally in the price of the asset. Based on the technical indicators, the coin formed sell signals at the current time. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals on the chart. This suggests a potential downward movement in price.

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is currently trading sideways after showing signs of recovery in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.  Although BTC managed to briefly recover the $27,000 level on Tuesday, it has failed to consolidate above it and is now stuck in a narrow range between $26,300 and $26,600 over the last 24 hours. The question on everyone&#8217;s mind now is whether Bitcoin will be able to regain its bullish momentum or if it will test its 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $25,200 once again. Bitcoin Pattern Points To Further Bullish Momentum Bitcoin traders and investors have reason to be optimistic, as the cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish butterfly pattern. According to technical analysis expert Mags, this harmonic reversal pattern is a strong indication of further potential upward movement for Bitcoin. Related Reading: UK Financial Conduct Authority Clamps Down on Crypto Marketing The bullish butterfly pattern is a type of harmonic reversal pattern that is often used by traders to identify potential trend changes in the markets. It is characterized by a series of price movements that form the shape of a butterfly, with a distinct &#8220;M&#8221; pattern followed by a smaller &#8220;W&#8221; pattern. The pattern is considered bullish because it suggests that the price of the asset is likely to reverse its previous downward trend and begin moving upward. &#160; In Bitcoin&#8217;s case, the bullish butterfly pattern is signaling a potential target of around $32,500. This projection is based on the historical price movements of Bitcoin, as well as the shape and structure of the butterfly pattern itself. While no pattern is foolproof, the bullish momentum of Bitcoin in recent months lends further support to this target. However, Bitcoin faces a potential challenge ahead, as it struggles to surpass its nearest resistance level at $27,500 and consolidate above it. If BTC fails to break through this price point, it may be vulnerable to retesting its 200-day Moving Average.  This key support level is crucial for BTC&#8217;s short-term bullish momentum, and failure to hold above it could lead to further price drops. In such a scenario, the $24,000 and $23,000 marks may become the next trading range for BTC. Currently, the bulls&#8217; threshold in the short term is the 200-day MA, which will need to hold if BTC is to maintain its upward trend. Short-Term BTC Liquidations Favor The Bulls Recent data provided by &#8216;The King Fisher&#8217; indicates that most Bitcoin liquidations are skewed to the upside, signaling possible upside movements in the near term for BTC. As seen in the chart above, the majority of Bitcoin positions in the past few days have been short positions, with 87% of traders betting on a price decrease, compared to only 12% who are bullish on an upward movement.  However, this situation may not favor BTC bears in the long run, as institutional investors historically take advantage of high levels of liquidations, which could lead to what is known as a &#8220;short squeeze,&#8221; to further fuel a movement in the opposite direction. This dynamic could potentially fuel the bullish momentum that Bitcoin needs to break through its nearest resistance and regain the $30,000 level that was lost in April.
