The ETH price intraday decline came as a part of a broader weekly downtrend accelerated by the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-btc-dips-below-25k-first-time-3-months\">Federal Reserve's hawkish tone</a> a day ago.</p><p>The U.S. central bank left the benchmark interest rates unchanged due to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-rejects-cpi-boost-market-fed-rate-pause-odds-near-95\">cooling inflation</a>. But its chairman, Jerome Powell, asserted that they would hike rates more than investors had expected in 2023, all until the consumer prices drop meaningfully and significantly.</p><p>ETH's price has declined by approximately 7.5% since Powell's statement. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/10e6a230-cfb3-4380-8b25-2be29e6d237d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>In recent years, Ether has behaved like a riskier asset, showing a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-bitcoin-price-hold-24k-as-stocks-correlation-hits-lowest-since-2021\">strong positive correlation</a> with the U.S. stock indexes. On June 14 and 15, as well, the Ethereum token dropped in tandem with the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones. </p><p>Ether's price decline in the last 24 hours has also triggered a wave of leveraged <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sees-most-long-liquidations-of-2023-as-btc-price-tags-22-5k\">long liquidations</a> that reached $54.95 million on June 15, the highest among the top-ranking crypto assets, according to Coinglass.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/2eeec049-bf47-4987-a09c-26bec465d2b7.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Crypto market's liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglas</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the open interest of Ether-tied contracts dropped from nearly $6 billion on June 14 to $5.69 billion on June 15. In other words, long traders closed their positions by selling ETH, which may have accelerated the price drop.</p><h2>ETH price breaks below key support</h2><p>Ether's selloff on May 15 accelerated due to the price losing a key support confluence comprising multi-month ascending and horizontal trendlines and a 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $1,750.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/4156527e-307b-4344-b04c-3e43532d63aa.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>However, ETH/USD has the potential to recover a portion of its recent losses in June, given its daily <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-3-ways-the-relative-strength-index-rsi-can-be-used-as-a-sell-signal\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> has dropped below 30 — an \"oversold\" area that typically precedes a rebound or consolidation.</p><p>Ether's longer-timeframe chart also hints at a potential recovery ahead. Notably, the ETH/USD pair is still treading above its 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near $1,600 — a psychological support level since March 2023.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/e09caf97-c372-4480-93d0-9f073aa43f46.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 200-day EMA support coincides with the lower trendline constituting what appears to be a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-bull-flag-chart-pattern-and-how-to-spot-it\">bull flag</a>. </p><p>Therefore, Ether's likelihood to rise toward the flag's upper trendline near $1,850 is high on a decisive rebound from the lower one — which would be an approximately 15% jump from current prices.</p><p>Meanwhile, a break above the flag's upper trendline could have the ETH price reach $2,500 in 2023 as its next upside target.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-pool-imbalance-usdt-depeg-concerns-tether-cto-calls-it-fud\">Curve pool imbalance triggers USDT depeg concerns, Tether CTO calls it FUD</a></em></strong></p><p>Conversely, the bearish scenario will be a drop below the flag's lower trendline. This could further pull down ETH price, particularly toward the Q1 support range of $1,400-1,450.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Joining host Elisha Owusu Akyaw for the conversation is Eric Annan, the CEO of Aya, a platform that uses blockchain technology to provide training and connect Africans to the job market. </p><p>Annan, a Web3 entrepreneur, entered the cryptocurrency space after resigning from his job at a tech firm. He then moved to Nigeria, where his first business failed due to regulatory changes from the Nigerian central bank. He gravitated toward cryptocurrencies to escape the traditional financial system, which proved problematic after he fell victim to several scams. Since then, Annan has advocated for cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain technology on the African continent. </p><p>Elisha highlights that the narrative of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies playing an important role in the future of the African continent has become monotonous and has lost some of its meaning. However, Annan explains that blockchain could yet play an important role considering the problems Africans face. According to the CEO, the biggest issue most Africans must tackle is intercontinental trade. While cryptocurrencies like stablecoins have significantly improved the situation, international platforms like PayPal continue to shut most Africans out. </p><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2096415\"></template><p>Annan also draws attention to the education system, which he believes limits opportunities for young people. He explains that he built Aya to counter this by creating a platform that makes it easier for Africans to upskill and connect with opportunities. What’s more, he argues that it would be much better if Africans could access opportunities without having to leave their home countries — something he describes as “brain export” — while being able to contribute to their local economies.</p><blockquote>“This time round, not brain drain but brain export.“ </blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-evangelist-joe-hall-tells-the-agenda-why-he-thinks-btc-will-conquer-the-world\">Bitcoin evangelist Joe Hall tells The Agenda why he thinks BTC will conquer the world</a></em></strong></p><p>Listen to the full episode of <em>Hashing It Out </em>with Eric Annan on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hashing-it-out/id1658998696?app=podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ibvcrJ87PAso4DBIiE5qn?si=5071800991044f7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yMDk2NDE1LnJzcw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Google Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/Hashing-It-Out-p3083469/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TuneIn</a>.
