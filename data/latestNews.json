Source: Satoshi Nakamoto Institute</em></figcaption></figure><p>The whitepaper proposed a decentralized system that could facilitate peer-to-peer transactions which could solve the “double spending” problem often associated with digital currency. </p><p>It proposed to achieve this via a network of nodes to validate and record transactions through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, launching just two months later on Jan. 3, 2009.</p><h3>How Bitcoin was brought to life</h3><p>Satoshi’s computer science breakthrough came on the back of other impressive developments in the cryptography and e-money space.</p><p>The first reference cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper is Wei Dai’s invention of b-money, an electronic peer-to-peer cash system which never launched but nonetheless played a key role in Satoshi’s plans for Bitcoin.</p><p>Like Bitcoin, b-money proposed that participants of the system maintain a database of account balances, which keep track of the ownership of money. Transactions would be initiated and completed by a broadcast message to all participants, which would update the account balances of those involved in a specific transaction.</p><p>In many ways, it could be seen as a precursor to the nodes of Bitcoin’s protocol which keep a record of the constantly growing blockchain.</p><p>This process is one which requires proof-of-work — a form of cryptographic proof in which one party proves to others that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended.</p><p>Satoshi implemented this into Bitcoin, citing Adam Back’s invention of Hashcash in 1997 which incorporated proof-of-work to limit e-mail spam and denial-of-service attacks. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Cypherpunks and Fathers of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a>:<br><br>• Hal Finney: Reusable PoW<br>• Adam Back: Hashcash<br>• Wei Dai: B-money<br>• David Chaum: DigiCash<br>• Nick Szabo: BitGold<br>• Phil Zimmermann: PGP<br>• Bram Cohen: BitTorrent<br>• Tim May: Crypto Anarchist Manifesto<br><br>And Satoshi Nakamoto: Bitcoin</p>&mdash; Crypto Leroy (@TheBitLeroy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBitLeroy/status/1276808335807746048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Timestamps are another core property of Bitcoin which was successfully implemented by Satoshi.</p><p>Bitcoin’s timestamp server works by taking a hash — akin to a unique serial number — of a block of transactions and timestamping it towhen the block is added to Bitcoin’s blockchain. </p><p>The hashes cryptographically link one block to the next, ensuring integrity of Bitcoin data. Timestamps also prevent double spending on Bitcoin, making the network tamper-proof and immutable.</p><p>Satoshi cited work from Henri Massias, Scott Stornetta, Stuart Haber and Dave Bayer in implementing timestamping into Bitcoin’s protocol.</p><p>Meanwhile,Merkle trees were implemented into Bitcoin to verify transaction data through digital signatures.

Nakamoto's genius was not any of the individual components of Bitcoin, but rather the intricate way in which they fit together to breathe life into the system.”</blockquote><h3>What Bitcoin did</h3><p>Bitcoin was at the time, one of the first inventions to use cryptography to successfully separate money from state.
