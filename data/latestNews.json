    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-coinbase-9-year-low/",
    "description": "In a recent development, data from crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows that the amount of Bitcoin held on Coinbase has reached a 9-year low. This has raised the possibility of the flagship crypto rising to a new all-time high (ATH) of $75,000 soon enough.  BTC Held On Coinbase Drops Significantly  According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin balance on Coinbase dropped to a nine-year low of 344,856 on March 18. This suggests that Bitcoin investors are choosing to move their holdings off exchanges and hold for the long term rather than sell anytime soon. A move like this reduces the short-term pressure on Bitcoin and could spark an upward trend in BTC&#8217;s price.  Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? Meanwhile, the drop in BTC held on Coinbase looks to be a trend, with data from market intelligence platform Santiment showing a drop in the total amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges (CEXs). This data is also supported by the fact that these exchanges have recorded more outflows than inflows lately.  Further data from Santiment also shows that the supply on exchanges as of March 22 stood at just over 836,000 BTC compared to the 18.82 million BTC that resides out of these CEXs. The decline in the number of BTC held on exchanges is undoubtedly a welcome development, considering how the flagship crypto token has recently been plagued with a wave of profit-taking.  Before now, the bearish sentiment surrounding BTC was further strengthened by JPMorgan’s theory that Bitcoin was overbought and that the crypto token could experience further price declines soon enough. However, with BTC back over $70,000, there is the belief that this is just the beginning of an upward trend that could see it reach new highs.  Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Net Inflows BitMEX Research revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of $15.7 million on March 25. This represents a positive turn of events after these funds recorded negative flows throughout last week. The wave of profit-taking by these Bitcoin ETF investors contributed to the BTC dip that occurred during that period.  Related Reading: 7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week The crypto community will no doubt keep their eyes on the flows recorded by these Spot Bitcoin ETFs this week as they could give an idea of whether or not the outlook towards BTC has become bullish again. These Bitcoin ETFs now play a prominent role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, considering how much BTC these fund issuers accumulate whenever there is a high demand for them.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,700, up over 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.
