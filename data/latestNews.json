Avneri believes that a massive amount of coins offered for trading on crypto exchanges is among core reasons for legal issues.</p><p>“You cannot continue to trade cryptocurrencies as if they are not securities. Those days are over,” Avneri said in an interview with Cointelegraph on June 19. According to the COO, INX outlined this exact idea in its prospectus five years ago. “It's like we had this crystal ball in our hands,” he added.</p><p>According to data from CoinGecko, Coinbase has as many as 241 cryptocurrencies <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">listed</a> on its platform at the time of writing, offering a total of 530 trading pairs. After managing to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-binance-seek-compromise-on-us-assets-freeze\">compromise on an asset freeze</a> with U.S. regulators, rival exchange Binance.US still <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance_us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">offers</a> 154 cryptos for trading.</p><p>In contrast to Coinbase or Binance.US, INX has only listed five cryptocurrencies since it was founded in 2017. The listed coins include Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>), Avalanche (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/avalanche-price-index\">AVA</a>) and Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>), Avneri said.</p><p>“That's it. A very limited crypto offering,” the COO stated, adding that INX chooses very carefully which cryptocurrencies it lists for trading on its platform. He also stressed that INX should not be considered as a pure crypto company because the firm is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/inx-security-token-platform-gets-its-first-token-from-a-public-company-greenbriar\">mainly focused on digitized, or tokenized, securities</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-fight-for-clarity\"><strong><em>Ripple case nears conclusion, but the fight for clarity must ‘continue’ — Brad Garlinghouse</em></strong></a></p><p>Avneri added that Bitcoin is “definitely not a security,” while there is no clear definition of Ether as such:</p><blockquote>“There is no definition for Ethereum as a security just yet. I know there are a lot of discussions around it. I know there are a lot of opinions around it and we are closely monitoring the news and we'll continue to do so. So basically, Ethereum, for now, is listed on INX.”</blockquote><p>INX will also find a way to list ETH on its platform in case it’s deemed security one day, Avneri told Cointelegraph.</p><p>The COO also stated that INX sees opporunity in that thousands of cryptocurrencies now need to find a way to be converted into securities and listed on platforms like INX. “They need to find a way to be listed and to properly register with the SEC as securities,” Avneri stated, adding:</p><blockquote>“I believe that this path will get clearer and clearer. And I think it's it again, it puts the industry in a very unique and I would say turning point or even a point of no return.”</blockquote><p>The latest remarks by Avneri echo similar comments made by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. In September 2022, Gensler <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-majority-cryptocurrencies-securities-124610154.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM3QtVWQc16qo-UuCwMCAGxKFFJXpmezTO85cHmA1aRXWQmsvOWE6FejrDr_0fPdGhEkqeLxqsbgeXVMcFYPQjEJIevqfrCQ06GrMKXankHLib4uG0UaL7mTGdOljfuu9fTDM_OhJcq35sY1Ur5KobfAlXaI5a2EIPhZPxamn6-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">argued</a> that most cryptocurrencies are securities. Prior to becoming SEC chair, Gensler also argued that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-gary-gensler-in-2018-video-says-btc-eth-not-securities\">more than 70% of crypto markets are not securities</a>, including coins like Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and others.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><p>As previously reported, INX positions itself as one of the first companies to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-registered-crypto-issuer-inx-to-wrap-up-ipo-in-april\">conduct a security token offering approved by the U.S. SEC</a>.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-narrative-summer-lsdfi/",
    "description": "Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) on Ethereum were one of the biggest topics in the crypto market in the first months of 2023. Thanks to Ethereum&#8217;s shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), LSD projects such as Lido Finance (LDO) and Frax Finance (FXS) flourished. In simple terms, LSDs are financial instruments that represent tokens that have been used as receipts within a DeFi protocol. Through these, users are able to stake their token while having the flexibility to use these LSDs in other decentralized applications. Best New Crypto Narrative For H2 2023? And according to some experts, LSDfi could become the new biggest trend for the second half of 2023. Crypto analyst @DaanCrypto recently wrote: &#8220;My best guesses for narratives going into the Summer: BTC Chain/Layer, LSDfi. Been loading up on some ALTS that fall into these categories.&#8221; Remarkably, Binance Research also recently published a detailed report on LSDfi that is well worth reading for investors. LSDfi refers to DeFi protocols built on liquid staking derivatives. By providing additional yield opportunities, LSDfi protocols allow LSD holders to leverage their assets and maximize returns. According to Binance&#8217;s report, LSDfi protocols have seen a rapid increase in Total Value Locked, TVL in recent months, benefiting from the introduction of liquid staking. Related Reading: Crypto King Do Kwon Behind Bars: Sentenced To 4 Months In Montenegrin Jail Cumulative TVL across the major LSDfi protocols has surpassed the $400 million mark, more than doubling in the last month. Tailwinds for LSDfi growth include the rise of staked ETH as well as the current low adoption of LSDfi. Remarkably, the trend is still relatively young. LSDs currently hold an $16.9 billion market cap, while LSDfi only accounts for 2% of that market, creating a massive opportunity. In addition, ETH&#8217;s staking ratio is significantly lower than the average of the top 20 PoS chains. The ETH ratio is just 16.1%, while the average ratio is 58.1%. The growth potential is therefore also huge in view of this. Popular crypto researchers @MooMs and @Flowslikeosmo looked into the Binance report and examined the most important projects in the LSDfi space at the moment. Currently, the LSDfi landscape is relatively concentrated, with the five largest players owning over 81% of TVL. Lybra is the market leader, and its rise to the top has been rapid, considering that the project only went online on its main network in April. Lybra Finance (LBR) was a pioneer in the LSDfi space, launching eUSD, one of the fastest growing yielding stable coins in the space. To date, Lybra holds over 36% of all LSD TVL and is working on some big changes to its tokenomics model for V2. LBR v2 is expected to bring some huge changes to the tokenomics model. &#8220;With Lybra currently trading at a significant 70% discount from its previous highs, it is definitely worth keeping an eye on.&#8221; says @Flowslikeosmo. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price In second place is currently Instadapp (INST), which is revolutionizing the DeFi industry by creating a comprehensive hub for all things DeFi. Instadapp&#8217;s IETH has seen explosive growth and currently holds 13.38% of the LSDfi market share. With the current smart strategies, users can earn higher returns on their ETH by using dApps such as AAVE, Morpho, MakerDAO and Compound. The third largest LSDfi protocol is currently Pendle, which allows users to use &#8220;upfront&#8221; returns to create customized strategies that match their risk tolerance and time preferences. Notably, Pendle has two return aggregators that have recently launched to add value to the Pendle ecosystem. Important to note:  Even though LSDfi offers attractive opportunities for LSD users, users should be aware of the risks involved. At press time, Lybra Finance (LBR) traded at $1.65, down 66.9% from the all-time high on May 29. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"
