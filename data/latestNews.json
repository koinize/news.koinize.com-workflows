In March, the libertarian think tank <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-could-be-easily-weaponized-to-spy-on-us-citizens-congressman\">said</a> a programmable CBDC would be “easily weaponized” as a spying tool to “choke out politically unpopular activity.”</p><p>Emmer <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-lawmaker-introduces-bill-aimed-at-limiting-fed-s-authority-on-digital-dollar\">introduced</a> the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act in February to “halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats in Washington, DC from stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy.” The bill was endorsed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senator-ted-cruz-tries-again-with-new-bill-to-block-cbdc\">introduced</a> his own CBDC blocking bill in March. </p><p><em><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-regulation-sec-chair-gary-gensler-final-say/\">Crypto regulation — Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</a></strong></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
