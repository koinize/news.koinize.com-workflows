    "description": "<p>Mahe,, Seychelles, May 30th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>DigiFinex, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has been granted a Pre-Registration Undertaking (\"PRU\") exemption-based approval by the Canadian regulator (at the provincial level, Alberta Securities Commission and other provinces providing reciprocal recognition). This license allows DigiFinex to operate in Canada in accordance with the terms of the PRU agreed with the regulator, and provides a unique opportunity for Canadian clients to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on DigiFinex's platform.</p><p>The PRU agreed upon is the result of a lengthy and prudent discussion with the regulator, and is a crucial regulatory requirement for cryptocurrency participants wanting to operate a dealer platform in Canada. To comply with the PRU, DigiFinex needs to put in place stringent measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulator also demands adequate security systems be established and maintained to protect investors' assets and personal information.</p><p>Additionally, DigiFinex must ensure that it has proper risk management procedures in place to safeguard against market manipulation and other fraudulent activities.DigiFinex's PRU was announced officially by the regulator in March 2023, making it one of a handful of operators with a certain pathway and timeline for achieving full approval from the Canadian government in the coming months. This achievement highlights DigiFinex's commitment to providing a safe and secure platform for its users, in line with prevalent market and regulatory demand.</p><p>&nbsp;DigiFinex has always placed a strong emphasis on the Canadian market. In recent times, the collapse of prominent industry participants has caused a collective crisis of confidence in the crypto industry. In response, DigiFinex looked at ways to improve transparency, security and efficiency towards keeping client assets safe without compromising other aspects of its services. DigiFinex has partnered with Qualified Custodian Tetra Trust, bringing&nbsp;access to a qualified custodian solution. As a regulated trust company,&nbsp;Tetra&rsquo;s offering encompasses robust controls, including the maintenance&nbsp;of a suite of insurance products. In addition, Tetra&rsquo;s partners maintain&nbsp;comprehensive client asset crime indemnity underwritten by a syndicate&nbsp;led by UK-based insurance powerhouse Lloyds. Along with other licensed dealer platforms in Canada, DigiFinex sets a new standard for asset protection in the industry and will undoubtedly attract more investors and traders to the platform.</p><p>&nbsp;DigiFinex is also committed to global compliance operations, working closely with regulatory agencies worldwide to achieve regulatory requirements. As a stable and reputable platform operating in the industry since 2018, DigiFinex prioritized the provision of transparency and reliability in cryptocurrency trading. The platform offers a wide range of trading pairs, advanced trading tools and a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced traders to navigate.</p><p>The PRU exemption-based license is an important milestone for DigiFinex, epitomising its focus on providing its users with a safe and secure platform. The new regulatory regime highlights the increasing importance of regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency industry and underscores the need for cryptocurrency participants to work closely with regulatory agencies to promote a safe and secure trading environment.</p><p>About DigiFinex</p><p>DigiFinex, originating from Singapore and established in 2017, is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange.

    "description": "<p>Over the past few years, the creators' market has evolved remarkably, characterized by a consistent pattern. Within the realm of Web 2, many noteworthy projects have emerged, each leaving an indelible mark on the landscape. Among these standout platforms are the illustrious Patreon and Cameo, which have garnered immense popularity and achieved astonishing billion-dollar valuations.</p>\n<p>These platforms have revolutionized how creators interact with their audience and play a pivotal role in redefining the perception and value of digital art. Also, they have sparked an unparalleled surge in recognition and appreciation for artistic endeavors within the digital realm.</p>\n<p>In the dynamic landscape of web3, where numerous projects have sought to harness the potential of creators, many have encountered difficulties stemming from their exclusive reliance on cryptocurrencies. This singular approach has often proven to be a stumbling block, constraining the growth and reach of these projects and ultimately limiting their audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, amidst this backdrop, there emerges a shining example of a project that has adeptly embraced both the rising creator trend and the transformative power of cryptocurrencies - Paysenger.</p>\n<p>Paysenger, with its array of ground-breaking features, provides a compelling chance for creators, experts, and their dedicated audience to forge meaningful connections. Within this innovative platform, creators are afforded a multitude of avenues to monetize their talent and engage with their supporters on a deeper level.</p>\n<p>Creators can produce captivating content that resonates with their audience, test the waters of the NFT marketplace by selling unique and coveted posts, participate in paid chats that facilitate direct interaction with their fans, and provide exclusive access to premium subscription-based content. All of these transactions and interactions occur within the ecosystem of Paysenger, fueled by its native token, EGO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Paysenger distinguishes itself from most SocialFi projects through its ability to seamlessly transition from the web2 era to the transformative landscape of web3. This smooth transition empowers Paysenger to overcome the inherent limitations often encountered by web3 initiatives, setting it apart. The founders of Paysenger are deeply motivated by their overarching mission to facilitate the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and introduce cryptocurrencies to a broader user base.</p>\n<p>EGO Token: Seven Convincing Reasons to Invest in It in 2023</p>\n<p>Impressive Growth and Influencer Campaign</p>\n<p>In August 2023, Paysenger will set off on a large-scale campaign by forming relationships with great business partners in Europe and the United States. Thousands of influential people would be involved. They'd support the platform's goal by telling their loyal fans about the great product and the interesting EGO token.</p>\n<p>Extraordinary Quest for Unique Artificial Intelligence</p>\n<p>In a world where creativity and technology go hand in hand, Paysenger's creative team sets out on an innovative journey. With the help of Dr. Tamay Aykut, a former Stanford professor, Paysenger forms a unique relationship to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence. The Paysenger AI enables creators to add their unique style to their work. This AI opens a symphony of ways to make money through a complex web of neural networks, giving creators a stage to share their artistic vision.</p>\n<p>Transcendence to Mainnet and the Soaring Token Demand</p>\n<p>Stepping out of the world of test tokens, Paysenger reveals its plans to move to the mainnet. As much as this new step would improve the platform, it also signals a rise in the demand for the EGO token. The EGO token enters the limelight as the test token tEGO gently disappears. Notably, the Paysenger community is excitedly waiting for this transition.</p>\n<p>Consensus with Leading Cryptocurrency Institutions</p>\n<p>Paysenger has also caught the attention of big names in the crypto world. Well-known companies like Polygon and ConsenSys are now actively supporting it. Polygon, a pioneering company known for its scale and ability to work with other systems, is behind Paysenger. This gives Paysenger an air of scientific savvy. This relationship also expands the platform's powers and makes it easier for creators and fans to thrive in a system that works well. In the same way, Paysenger gets support from its partnership with ConsenSys, a leader in blockchain innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Astounding Founder's Backgrounds</p>\n<p>As the story of Paysenger develops, the backgrounds of its leaders bring the project to the forefront. One of them is the brilliant owner of Unlimited Group, which is worth a billion dollars and is a respected partner of Visa and Mastercard. This remarkable history gives Paysenger a strong base. It also gives the platform useful knowledge and a wide range of development, which set the stage for the rise of the EGO token.</p>\n<p>Exquisite Reinvention of NFTs</p>\n<p>Paysenger uses a transforming approach to change the very nature of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). A prize every week is very appealing! The most popular non-fungible token is given the EGO token. This new way of doing things goes beyond just buying something. It turns the ownership and purchase of NFTs into staking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expansive User Base Propelling Ascendancy</p>\n<p>Paysenger has more than 500,000 users and more than 50,000 respected creators. This busy hive of activity demonstrates that the community is adopting the EGO token well.</p>\n<p>It's no doubt that Paysenger has won over the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of users. The platform's large user group, including many creators, fans, and innovators, shows its appeal.</p>\n<p>In Summary</p>\n<p>The upcoming switch to the mainnet will be a big change for Paysenger. It will open up many new options and put the EGO token in the spotlight. Investors are excited about this big technological step because it promises better functionality and a better sense of security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Meme coins are more than just entertaining digital finance mechanisms; in this article, we will discuss why this is and how the marketing strategies employed by these three cryptocurrencies have projected them to success. This article will also analyze their effectiveness in driving adoption and community engagement.</p>\n<p>You Can't Doge The Dogecoin</p>\n<p>Dogecoin, born out of an internet meme featuring a cute canine, has witnessed unprecedented popularity since its inception in 2013. Its success can be attributed to the clever use of memes in its marketing strategy. Dogecoin's community-driven nature and humorous approach have resonated with a broad audience, particularly on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The \"Doge\" meme has become integral to the cryptocurrency's brand identity, fostering a sense of inclusivity and lightheartedness within the community. Dogecoin's marketing strategy revolves around leveraging viral memes, which has been crucial in establishing its brand presence.</p>\n<p>Pepe-ing Up The Art World</p>\n<p>Pepe, named after the popular internet frog meme, takes a distinctive artistic approach in its marketing strategy. This cryptocurrency project leverages the creativity of artists by incorporating rare digital artwork into its ecosystem. Pepe's marketing revolves around establishing a marketplace for digital art where artists can showcase and sell their creations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By embracing the unique art community, Pepe has managed to attract artists and art enthusiasts who appreciate the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the art industry. Pepe's marketing strategy focuses on the intersection of digital art and blockchain, driving engagement and adoption within the artistic community.</p>\n<p>DogeMiyagi's Class Is In Session&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DogeMiyagi, inspired by the legendary martial arts master from the movie \"The Karate Kid,\" presents a unique marketing approach. The project emphasizes learning, wisdom, and personal growth, aiming to attract individuals seeking more than just financial gains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DogeMiyagi's marketing strategy centres around education, with informative content, tutorials, and webinars to help users navigate the world of cryptocurrencies. By positioning itself as a learning platform, DogeMiyagi taps into the growing interest in blockchain technology and crypto education, building a community of enthusiasts who value knowledge and continuous improvement.</p>\n<p>Which Meme Marketing Stands Out?</p>\n<p>While Dogecoin, DogeMiyagi, and Pepe differ significantly in their marketing approaches, they all share a common objective of attracting and engaging their target audiences. Dogecoin's meme-based strategy has created a strong community and increased brand recognition. Dogecoin has garnered a massive following by tapping into internet culture and humor.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pepe's marketing strategy relies on the allure of digital art, capturing the attention of artists and collectors who recognize the potential of blockchain technology in transforming the art industry. By integrating unique artwork into its ecosystem, Pepe creates a niche marketplace and cultivates a dedicated community of art enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>DogeMiyagi's educational focus sets it apart from the others. By providing valuable resources and knowledge, DogeMiyagi aims to empower its users, attracting individuals interested in expanding their understanding of cryptocurrencies beyond mere speculation. This educational approach helps foster a loyal community centred around personal growth and wisdom.</p>\n<p>For more on DogeMiyagi, check out the links below:</p>\n<p>Website: https://dogemiyagi.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Telegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Traditional cryptocurrency mining has become more challenging and less profitable because of the various factors. Expensive equipment, high electricity costs, and increased complexity has put miners in a difficult position. Due to the fact that traditional mining methods come with significant risks, there&rsquo;s no guarantee of making a profit.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is a new solution: Catmine.io cloud mining. It really is a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Challenges of Traditional Mining</p>\n<p>Traditional mining methods for cryptocurrencies have presented several challenges. They include rising costs, the need for extensive technical expertise, Unpredictable and Unstable Results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Rising Costs and Technical Expertise</p>\n<p>Traditional Cryptocurrency mining is expensive and requires technical expertise. Miners need to buy specialized equipment, like GPUs, which can be costly. As blockchain technology advances, mining becomes more complex and resource-intensive, requiring even more powerful hardware. This increases the overall costs of mining. Moreover, operating and maintaining mining rigs requires technical knowledge, which poses a challenge for newcomers without technical background.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Unpredictable and Unstable Results:</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency prices are highly unpredictable and are subject to rapid change. The market is known for its instability and volatility. It makes it challenging to analyze and understand its dynamics, therefore affecting mining profitability. When prices go up, mining is profitable because mined coins are worth more. Miners can sell them for a higher price and make a good return on their investment. But when prices go down, mining profitability decreases. It can even become unprofitable. Miners may struggle to cover costs like electricity and maintenance, leading to potential losses.</p>\n<p>Catmine.io Cloud Mining: One-stop shop for all traditional crypto mining solutions</p>\n<p>Catmine.io, a pioneering platform, is revolutionizing the landscape of cryptocurrency mining with its user-friendly approach. By offering cloud mining services, Catmine.io provides a hassle-free alternative to traditional mining methods, addressing the challenges faced by miners.</p>\n<p>Unlike other platforms, Catmine.io stands out with its simplicity and playful design. Despite its cartoonish appearance, the platform offers a reliable and professional service. Users can easily purchase miners and tools, enabling them to engage in efficient and predictable mining. The website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, even for those who are unfamiliar with mining.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Catmine.io goes beyond mining by incorporating five entertaining mini-games into the platform. These games are designed for user&rsquo;s enjoyment and provide additional rewards, adding a fun and interactive element to the mining activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With its advanced mining infrastructure, evolving platform, and the incorporation of enjoyable mini-games, Catmine.io provides users with an efficient and enjoyable mining experience. Any user can seize the opportunity to earn substantial profits, while navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Catmine's cloud mining service for CoughingCatCoin offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for newcomers to get started. Upon signing up, users receive a free miner and are rewarded with 0.004CCT after registration, allowing them to begin their mining journey with immediate bonuses.</p>\n<p>Even before the official launch of the platform, Catmine.io has gained a substantial user base. Since September 2021, the website has been operating steadily and is now undergoing a large-scale expansion of its capabilities.</p>\n<p>To date, users of Catmine.io have collectively mined a total of 41,613.16 CCT, showcasing the platform's effectiveness and the success of its mining services.</p>\n<p>This impressive user base and cumulative CCT mined demonstrates the credibility placed in Catmine.io as a reliable and profitable cloud mining platform. Users can anticipate even more chances for successful mining in the future as the platform continues to grow and improve its capabilities.</p>\n<p>With 95,356 users in total, Catmine has established itself as a popular choice for cloud mining CoughingCatCoin.</p>\n<p>To encourage users earning more coins, Catmine offers an enticing referral program. Users can invite friends and receive 10.82% from all their purchases. This gives any user an opportunity to increase the earnings through referrals. In addition, the platform rewards users with bonuses and gifts on a daily basis. So, the user can get a mini-miner with an infinite lifespan, CCT rewards and a reward equal to 20% of the user's total daily mining.</p>\n<p>In addition to its lucrative referral program and daily rewards, Catmine boasts the presence of an exclusive cryptocurrency called the Coughing Cat coin (CCT). Since its launch, CCT has demonstrated a remarkable track record of stable growth, making it an attractive investment option.</p>\n<p>It's important to mention the mechanics of the Catmine.io platform. Users have the option to buy miners, which have defined parameters in the Inventory section of the platform. By purchasing a miner, users can start mining the Coughing Cat coin (CCT).</p>\n<p>To illustrate the platform's potential, let's consider an example of purchasing a current miner at the prevailing rate and calculating its payback period and profit in dollars. Suppose a miner is priced at 2 CCT, equivalent to $4.36 at the current exchange rate. Based on the past 12 months remarkable growth of 830% in the CCT rate, it is projected that the miner will generate approximately 6.96 CCT in a year. If this upward trend continues, the user could potentially earn around $125 (please note that this calculation is approximate and requires up-to-date data from the website). This example demonstrates that mining with Catmine.io not only yields profitable results but also demands significantly less initial investment compared to traditional mining methods.</p>\n<p>The CCT coin holds great potential for future development and increasing investment attractiveness as Catmine continues to evolve and expand. The platform's constant development efforts ensure that CCT is poised to experience significant leaps in value.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the conversion rate for CoughingCatCoin (CCT) to Bitcoin (BTC) is 1 CCT = 0.00008106 BTC, allowing users to understand the relative value of their mined coins. It should be considered that this reflects the rate at the time of this article's publication. However, it is worth highlighting that the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, and exchange rates are subject to constant fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Considering the consistent growth trend of CCT, it is reasonable to anticipate that the exchange rate will soar to levels many times higher within a year. This projection underscores the potential for substantial returns on investment for early adopters and investors in CCT.</p>\n<p>With its user-friendly interface, free miner upon sign-up, generous referral program, and the potential to earn significant amounts of CoughingCatCoin, Catmine's cloud mining service is an attractive option for individuals looking to engage in hassle-free and profitable cryptocurrency mining.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-bullish-address-activity-spikes-historical-levels/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows the XRP active addresses metric has spiked to historical levels recently, a sign that may turn out to be bullish for the asset. XRP Daily Active Addresses Has Observed An Uplift Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, address activity on the network reached its second and third-highest values ever during the last couple of days. The &#8220;active addresses&#8221; indicator tracks the total number of unique addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the XRP blockchain daily. This metric accounts for both senders and receivers. As the indicator only measures the unique number of addresses, it means that even if there are some addresses making multiple transfers on the network in a single day, their contribution toward the metric remains only one unit. Unique addresses can be thought to be the same as the unique users visiting the blockchain, so the active addresses indicator can tell us about the degree of traffic that the network is observing at the moment. When the value of this metric is high, it means that a large number of addresses are taking part in transfers on the chain right now. Such a trend suggests that traders are active in the market currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Recovery: Did This Historical Line Act As Support Again? On the other hand, low values imply the network isn&#8217;t observing that much activity right now. This kind of trend can sometimes be a sign that there isn&#8217;t much interest in the cryptocurrency among general investors. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin daily active addresses over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the XRP active addresses had been at relatively low values during the past few weeks, but in the last couple of days, the indicator has suddenly burst into life. Around two days ago, the metric saw its second-highest-ever daily spike, registering a value of around 490,000. This means that 490,000 unique addresses had been interacting on the chain during this surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Hopes Still Alive, If This Metric Is To Go By Yesterday, the metric observed a slowdown and has since dropped down to a value of 281,000. This level, however, is still the third largest in the history of the cryptocurrency, meaning that activity still continues to be at historically high levels right now. The only instance where a higher value than these spikes was observed (that is, the all-time high of the indicator) was back on the 18th of March. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted this particular surge. Interestingly, the price of XRP went on to rally around 45% following the occurrence of this spike, suggesting that the high user activity may have provided the fuel for the rise. Currently, as users continue to remain highly active on the network, the price is also going up. It&#8217;s unclear, though, whether this ongoing surge will grow into anything like what was seen earlier in the year, but it&#8217;s an optimistic sign nonetheless. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.5, up 8% in the last week. The coin seems to have been going up recently &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
