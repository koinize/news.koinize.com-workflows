From supporting increased <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions\">transaction speeds and volumes</a> to enhancing security and enabling smart contracts directly within Bitcoin, an L2’s technical advantages alone make it a major development within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>However, the effects of a Bitcoin L2 have the potential to reach far beyond technical improvement. The emergence of Bitcoin staking, which has been impossible until now, is a major step in legitimizing and mainstreaming crypto staking in general. As well as creating value for currency holders, staking creates a new kind of interest rate, defined by users rather than by central banks and government policy. This \"people’s interest rate\" offers an alternative to the flawed traditional interest rate systems — and the ability to stake a trusted and highly-recognized asset bolsters the feasibility and credibility of this vision.</p><p>Essentially, the introduction of a Bitcoin L2 means that instead of relying on the public internet to transmit data, Bitcoin transactions can now be conveyed across a layer-2 (or the data-link layer), guaranteeing data speeds and packet delivery regardless of traffic levels between the two parties.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-layer-2-staking-offers-superior-alternative-interest-rates\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

Given that Ether experienced a flash crash down to $3,180 on Feb. 28, some investors believe that excessive optimism driven by fear of mis FOMO has increased the risk of cascading liquidations.</p><p>Firstly, one needs to note that some traders might need temporary leverage while they raise cash, either by selling other assets or waiting for deposits to kick in. Such movements are common in the heat of the market, even for professional arbitrage desks, and cause the funding rate to soar, which can last for a couple of days or even weeks.</p><p>Some analysts argue that the reason behind investors' increased optimism toward Ether’s price is the upcoming Dencun hard fork, scheduled for March 13. The upgrade introduces several improvements, including proto-danksharding, which aims to reduce layer-2 transaction fees. The expected upgrade would greatly reduce the data registry cost for Ethereum network's preferred scaling solution, rollups.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/was-ether-flash-crash-3180-triggered-by-excessive-leverage\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a roll, having again broken above the crucial $0.00001 resistance level. This recent price surge from the meme coin is believed to be propelled by several factors that undoubtedly provide a bullish narrative for the crypto token.  Burn Rate Contributes To The Shiba Inu Rise Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that SHIB’s burn rate has increased exponentially as of late, contributing to the meme coin’s latest price surge. According to Shibburn, almost 103 million SHIB tokens have burned in the last 24 hours, a 1913% increase from the previous day.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm: Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin And Ethereum Before Bull Run This is a welcome development, considering that Bitcoinist reported a crash in the SHIB token burns a week ago, with only about 2 million SHIB tokens burned on February 20. As such, a spike in the token burns automatically sends a bullish signal across the ecosystem. Token burning is one of the initiatives the SHIB community has adopted to help increase SHIB’s value. Meanwhile, the recent petition launched by the SHIB community urging Grayscale Investments to offer a Shiba Inu ETF is another factor that could be driving the meme coin’s bullish momentum. Although it seems like a reach, the possibility of launching an ETF that centres around the meme coin is one that provides optimism to SHIB investors.  Moreover, the impact that just rumours about an ETF launch could have on the crypto token in question has become evident, having seen how Bitcoin rose significantly on the back of reports that a Spot Bitcoin ETF would be approved.  Investors Are Betting More On SHIB Data from Coinglass shows that the open interest for SHIB has increased in the last 24 hours. This is significant as the derivatives market is known to impact a crypto token’s price discovery. The increase in open interest also suggests that traders are likely placing more bullish leveraged bets on the meme coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Eye New Record As BTC Price Touches $57,000 This increased interest in the Shiba Inu ecosystem is not surprising, considering how much work the team continues to put in to ensure that the crypto token stands out as more than a meme coin. Earlier this month, they secured a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a liquid staking derivatives (LSD) platform.  This move will ultimately benefit SHIB as more token burns are expected to be carried out due to increased trading activity on Shibarium. More liquidity is also likely to flow into the ecosystem soon enough as K9 Finance recently announced its token generation event, which will take place on March 7.  At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001075, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  SHIB price showing strength at $0.000011 &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CryptoRank, chart from Tradingview.com"
