    "description": "Shibarium, the Shiba Inu layer-2 solution, recently reached a new milestone in the past few days, crossing the 4 million total transaction threshold. The launch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu&#8217;s layer-2 solution, has been a huge catalyst for the meme coin. At the same time, SHIB&#8217;s burn rate has exploded in the last two days, as investors look to push the price of SHIB in a positive direction. Shibarium&#8217;s Rapid Growth, Burn Rate Skyrockets In just the past few months, over 4 million transactions have taken place on the Shibarium network. According to Shibariumscan, the total transaction count now stands at 4.27 million at the time of writing, with the total block count also at 1.87 million, steadily approaching 2 million. The platform saw its daily transactions soar last weekend, reaching as high as 43,690 on November 23. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Sold The Bitcoin Top Reveals How To Buy And Sell At The Perfect Time This milestone seems to have rolled over to Shiba Inu&#8217;s token burning. According to data from Shibburn, Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn tracker, the burn rate has increased significantly this week. The last 24 hours have seen the token burns reach 82,887,109 SHIB, an increase of 913.89% from the previous day.  SHIB tokens can be burned by any Shiba Inu investor by sending the tokens to any of the SHIB burn addresses. Apparently, most of the latest 24-hour figure came from one address, which incinerated 82.86 million SHIB tokens.  The uptick in SHIB burns has been going on for a while now. The burn rate increased by almost 500,000% over the weekend with more than 264.20 million SHIB tokens sent to inactive addresses. What’s Next For Shiba Inu — Road To $0.00008? Shiba Inu burns are a way to create artificial scarcity for SHIB, driving up the price of the tokens in circulation. However, the price of SHIB hasn’t reacted to the recent burns and the Shibarium transaction milestone.  Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move Shiba inu is currently trading at $0.000008221 and is down by 1.62% in the past 24 hours. On the larger timeframe, the crypto is up by 13.68% from its October bottom of 0.000006. The fundamentals surrounding SHIB also point to a price rise in the coming months as support grows.  With increasing utility, the creation of new tokens in the SHIB ecosystem, partnerships like the recent one with boxer Manny Pacquiao, and more widespread mainstream interest on the horizon, analysts see SHIB revisiting and possibly surpassing its former high of $0.000088. However, this would mean the Shiba Inu price would rise 902% from its current price.  SHIB price trades in a tight range &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CryptoTicker, chart from Tradingview.com"
