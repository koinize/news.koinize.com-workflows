    "description": "In a unique display of community support and unity, one of Shiba Inu’s native tokens, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) has risen to the top five in Binance’s Future NEXT program, aiming to secure the number one spot for a potential token listing.  Related Reading: Ethereum Wallets Overflow: Over 90% Addresses In Profit, Ether To Retest ATH SHIB Community Rally Over 20,000 BONE Picks The Shiba Inu community has been demonstrating an amazing amount of support for its burgeoning ecosystem, rallying around the BONE token to help propel its position to the top spot in Binance’s Future NEXT program.  Initially at the 14th position on Binance’s new program, BONE made an exponential leap, swiftly climbing more than 10 ranks within 24 hours to secure third position in Binance’s Future NEXT token listing challenge. With its popularity skyrocketing from a modest 2,657 picks to over 23,810 picks, BONE has become a major competitor for Delysium (AGI) and Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE), which, at the time of writing, holds the first and second position respectively.  This substantial climb in ranks underscores the Shiba Inu community’s strong support and dedication towards its ecosystem and native tokens. Moreover, it highlights the considerable interest and demand for the popular BONE token to be featured on Binance’s Future platform.  Championing BONE’s ambitious journey to claim the number one spot, Shiba Inu’s marketing influencer, Lucie has urged community members to keep up their unwavering support for BONE. She has motivated members to vote for the token to become the top choice for Binance’s Future NEXT listing.  As highlighted by Binance, the voting process entails a $1 fee per vote, enabling individuals to acquire as many votes as they desire. In this context, the financial commitment of the Shiba Inu community is also underscored, with a substantial contribution exceeding $20,800. This amount reflects the number of picks made towards elevating BONE to its current third position.   Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView Next Step For Potential BONE Listing As BONE continues its ambitious climb to the topmost position on Binance’s Futures NEXT listing, it&#8217;s important to mention that attaining the number one position does not guarantee an immediate listing. The cryptocurrency will have to undergo the necessary review and screening processes by Binance before being considered for the official listing.  Binance has revealed intentions to carry out a proper listing process, evaluating all contenders including Delysium and Baby Doge Coin.
