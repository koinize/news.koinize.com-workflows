Here are some approaches to investment that Munger swore by: </p><h3>Only invest in what you know</h3><p>Munger said Berkshire Hathaway would often categorize stocks into one of three baskets when evaluating a potential investment.</p><blockquote>“We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.”</blockquote><p>The latter could explain why Munger and Buffet never invested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but the takeaway message is that they avoided investing in what they didn’t know.</p><p>Buffet has previously admitted he and Munger — both regarded as tech skeptics — were “too dumb to realize” the potential of Amazon’s e-commerce business in the 1990s and underestimated the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Berkshire didn’t invest in Microsoft or Google either. “We blew it,” Munger once said, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-munger-says-it-was-a-mistake-for-berkshire-hathaway-to-not-invest-in-google-and-walmart-2017-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-amp=\"https://www-businessinsider-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.businessinsider.com/charlie-munger-says-it-was-a-mistake-for-berkshire-hathaway-to-not-invest-in-google-and-walmart-2017-5?amp\">reflecting</a> on the firm’s decision not to invest in Google.</p><p>Despite that, Berkshire stuck to the sectors it knew inside out, such as the banking and food and beverage sectors, making huge profits from investments in Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola Co, and later Apple after initially deciding not to invest in it.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Charlie Munger’s formula for success is simple and perfect:<br><br>- Spend less than you earn <br>- Invest prudently <br>- Avoid toxic people and toxic activities<br>- Defer gratification<br>- Never stop learning <a href=\"https://t.co/8IiJNngsdg\">pic.twitter.com/8IiJNngsdg</a></p>— John LeFevre (@JohnLeFevre) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnLeFevre/status/1729609136101273828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>Munger and Buffet also mastered the art of valuation by interrogating a firm’s balance sheet before making an investment decision, which Munger once said is the only intelligent way to invest.</p><blockquote>“All intelligent investing is value investing [...] You must value the business in order to value the stock.” </blockquote><p>While blockchains and protocols can’t often be valued via a discounted cash flow model or other traditional methods, plenty of insights can be obtained from on-chain data — from the number of daily active users and transaction volumes to total value locked (relative to market cap) and net inflows and outflows, to name a few.</p><h3>Temperament, not IQ, is a bigger contributor to investment success</h3><p>Munger was never been one to dive headfirst into a new trend, preferring to stay on the more conservative side of investing.</p><p>He’s previously said many “high IQ” people are terrible investors because they have terrible temperaments. “Great investors,” on the other hand, tread with caution and think things through:</p><blockquote>\"The great investors are always very careful. They think things through. They take their time. They're calm. They're not in a hurry. They don't get excited. They just go after the facts, and they figure out the value. And that's what we try to do.\"</blockquote><p>“You need to keep raw irrational emotion under control,” Munger said in another comment.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-is-a-disgusting-product-that-comes-out-of-thin-air-says-charlie-munger\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-is-a-disgusting-product-that-comes-out-of-thin-air-says-charlie-munger/amp\"><strong><em>Bitcoin is a ‘disgusting’ product that comes ‘out of thin air,’ says Charlie Munger </em></strong></a></p><p>Having been in the investment arena for over 60 years, Munger says patience is also of great importance when accumulating wealth.</p><p>“The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting.”</p><h3>Build conviction and stomach volatility</h3><p>Munger has seen Berkshire’s investment portfolio dip several times over the decades, such as the Black Monday crash in 1987, the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>He once stressed that long-term investors must learn to stand by their investments when unfavorable macroeconomic conditions trigger market downfalls:</p><blockquote>\"If you're not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century, you're not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you're going to get.\" </blockquote><p>“There are going to be periods when there’s a lot of agony and other periods when there’s a boom,” Munger said in a separate comment. “You just have to learn to live through them.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Charlie Munger has passed away. <br><br>RIP to a legend </p>— Pomp  (@APompliano) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1729606347958673504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>Munger was born on Jan. 1, 1924 — meaning he passed away 34 days shy of his 100th birthday.</p><p>\"Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,\" Buffett said in a statement.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-substance-abuse-traders-trading/\"><strong><em>This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/binance-compliance-officer-under-scrutiny-for-ftx-gemini-and-sex-trafficker-associations/",
    "description": "In a recent investigative report by the media outlet Unlimited Hangout, serious allegations were made against Noah Perlman, the chief compliance officer of Binance.  The report highlights Perlman&#8217;s alleged ties to the collapse of FTX, the troubled Gemini exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, and even convicted and deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. If the allegations made by the media outlet prove true, and Perlman is investigated by US authorities, Binance could find itself embroiled in another executive scandal following the departure of former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Associations With Epstein And Alleged Fraud  Unlimited Hangout alleges that Perlman&#8217;s father, Itzhak Perlman, a renowned violinist, had flown on multiple occasions on a plane owned by Jeffrey Epstein. Itzhak Perlman also reportedly accompanied Epstein to Michigan&#8217;s Interlochen Center for the Arts, where Epstein later built a lodge for him, which was later described as a &#8220;lair to target girls.&#8221;  While Noah Perlman served as a federal prosecutor for the Department of Justice&#8217;s Special Coordinator for Crimes against Children, these family connections to Epstein raise questions about his associations. After leaving the Department of Justice, Perlman joined Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss Twins, as the chief compliance officer. Although Perlman had left Gemini months before the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the exchange, he had been allegedly “heavily involved” in Gemini&#8217;s Earn program, which became the focus of the alleged $1.1 billion fraud.  Related Reading: Analyst Thinks DOT Will Reclaim Former Glory With Polkadot 2.0 As reported by NewsBTC, the lawsuit alleges that certain individuals knew that the program&#8217;s partner, Genesis, was financially unstable and withdrew their funds before its collapse. Per the report, Perlman held the position of chief operating officer at the time, raising suspicions about his role in the alleged misconduct. Troubled Bank&#8217;s Links To Binance Officer And FTX Perlman&#8217;s involvement with Farmington State Bank, later renamed Moonstone, adds another layer of complexity to the alleged wrongdoing cited by Unlimited Hangout. According to the report, in 2019, Perlman was listed as a director of FBH Corp., the entity that took over the rural bank. Moonstone Bank later garnered attention when Alameda Research, linked to FTX, acquired an $11.5 million stake.  Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of FTX, also reportedly invested $50 million in the bank. However, Moonstone Bank faced regulatory challenges, with the Federal Reserve initiating an enforcement action against it shortly before the Bank of Eastern Oregon acquired its deposits and assets. Overall, Perlman is at the center of serious allegations concerning his alleged connections with Jeffrey Epstein, the failed Earn program at Gemini, and Moonstone Bank.  However, it is important to note that these allegations have not been substantiated by any investigations or official connections made by US authorities or other global agencies.  Related Reading: Unlocking Bitcoin ETF Profits: Experts Reveals “Best” Trading Strategy The claims and allegations put forth by media news outlets require further response from Binance&#8217;s executives and investigation by relevant authorities. There has been no official statement from Perlman regarding these allegations. It remains to be seen how the exchange and Perlman himself will address these claims and provide clarity on the matter.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-unbreakable-floor-analyst-predicts-btc-wont-fall-below-35000-ever-again/",
    "description": "Controversial Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model creator PlanB has recently made a bold prediction about Bitcoin (BTC) that&#8217;s captured the crypto community&#8217;s attention. Via his social media handle X, PlanB stated that Bitcoin&#8217;s price would never plummet below the $35,000 threshold again. PlanB supported his claim with a chart illustrating Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation trend about its intrinsic hash rate. According to PlanB, this relationship is a critical indicator of the digital currency&#8217;s enduring value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Global Market Trends: Negative Correlation Hits Pre-Pandemic Levels Despite acknowledging potential black swan events or short-term market volatility, PlanB insists that based on the current fundamentals, particularly the cost of electricity ($/kWh) used in mining Bitcoin, the asset&#8217;s market value is &#8220;unlikely&#8221; to retract below the mentioned support level &#8211; $35,000. Mining And Market Arbitrage: A Key Factor The crux of PlanB&#8217;s argument lies in the unique arbitrage opportunity that exists between Bitcoin miners and everyday users. Miners, who invest heavily in electricity to mine the digital asset, and users, who typically purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency on exchanges, create a dynamic market environment. According to PlanB, this arbitrage might become even more pronounced with the advent of a potential launch of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. 🚨BREAKING: Bitcoin valuation based on difficulty (hashrate) increased to $35k yesterday. IMO this could mean that, apart from possible black swans or short term volatility, based on $/kWh-arbitrage fundamentals &#8230; BTC will never go below $35k ever again. pic.twitter.com/JPLkXieQAP — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) November 27, 2023 PlanB suggests that miners, equipped with specialized knowledge about the market and the actual cost of producing Bitcoin, might begin to demand a premium when selling the cryptocurrency. This shift could fundamentally alter the way Bitcoin is traded and its perceived value. The introduction of BTC spot ETFs, in particular, is expected to bring a new level of mainstream acceptance and investment into Bitcoin, potentially solidifying its price floor as predicted by PlanB. Bitcoin Hash Rate And Market Dynamics Delving deeper into the concept of Bitcoin’s hash rate, it&#8217;s essential to understand its role in securing the network and validating transactions. The hash rate basically measures the computational power being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain. A higher hash rate indicates more robust security and efficiency in the network, often correlating with increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher asset valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric PlanB&#8217;s analysis posits that Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation will follow suit as the hash rate continues to rise, driven by technological advancements and increased mining activities. This relationship forms the basis of his prediction that Bitcoin will maintain a strong market position, unlikely to fall below the $35,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading above $37,000, marking an increase of over $2,000 from the support level PlanB mentioned. Specifically, at the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price stands at $37,605, reflecting a 2% rise in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has again demonstrated its bullish momentum by surging above the $38,000 mark. Breaking free from the recent trading range between $36,500 and $37,500, BTC currently trades at $38,100, slightly below its yearly high of $38,400 achieved on Friday, November 24. However, this is just one of the many milestones BTC has achieved during its ongoing bullish resurgence. Bitcoin Achieves New 52-Week Closing Record According to crypto trading firm The Birb Nest, Bitcoin has set a new 52-week closing record by a small margin, holding above $32,000 for four consecutive weeks, demonstrating the continued strength of the uptrend.  Per the firm’s analysis, the observed performance aligns with the principles of Elliott Wave Theory and signifies the presence of the third wave within the ongoing bull market. Related Reading: Unlocking Bitcoin ETF Profits: Experts Reveals “Best” Trading Strategy Notably, of the five waves outlined in the theory, the third impulse wave is a visually captivating and crucial element of the overall pattern. Following the consolidation phase of the second wave that Bitcoin experienced between August and October, as seen on the 1-day chart of BTC above, the emergence of the third wave is characterized by a breakout that drives price action in line with the prevailing trend. In particular, this wave is known for its extended nature, which often exceeds the length of the first wave, which began at the beginning of January 2023 for BTC. The third wave exhibits a substantial extension relative to the length of the initial wave, typically reaching the 161.8% Fibonacci level. In simpler terms, the third wave can be interpreted as a 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the first wave. Solid Support Levels Reinforce Positive Outlook For BTC  According to The Birb Nest, key technical indicators further support Bitcoin&#8217;s market momentum. The 200-week moving average (MA) at $29,130 and the 50-week MA at $27,450 serve as solid support levels, reinforcing the positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s correlation coefficient has risen to 0.75, indicating an increased synchronization with the performance of the S&#38;P 500. This correlation can be viewed as a positive sign, particularly as the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq enter their &#8216;Best Months&#8217; strategy, which historically has been associated with market gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When Furthermore, the firm believes that anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is fueling investor interest. These factors hint at the potential for further market upturns and provide an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. It remains to be seen if the current bullish momentum will be sustained and if BTC can consolidate above $38,000 and target the $40,000 level yet to be reached in 2023.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/2-altcoins-70000-kaspa-kas/",
    "description": "Anyone paying attention to the crypto industry and altcoins in the last few months will have noticed the incredible run that the Kaspa native token, KAS, went on. When all was said and done, the token’s price had risen over 70000% from its all-time low of $0.0001699 which was recorded on June 1, 2022, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Given that the KAS token has risen so much, all eyes are now on the next coin that could replicate this growth. With thousands of altcoins in the space to pick from, with many of them being scams, it can be daunting to know which coins have the potential for such a rally. So in this report, we take a look at two altcoins that could potentially go the way of KAS and secure massive gains for investors. Geeq (GEEQ) Leads Low Cap Altcoins With Utility Geeq (GEEQ) was one of the many altcoins that burst into the scene back in 2020 as the bull market took flight. In the same year, the token would hit a new all-time high. But perhaps the most alluring part of the project was the many utilities that followed suit.

When a mainnet arrives, it will make it a prominent player among established blockchains. GEEQ’s market cap is currently sitting at less than $5 million which gives it a lot of runway to pull a run like KAS. It is also listed on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, including KuCoin, AscendEX, and Uniswap, among others. Total crypto market cap at &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com OXBT Piggybacks Off The Ordinals Craze As Ordinals became more of a fixture in the crypto market, multiple projects emerged that enjoyed the majority of the popularity. Some of these include the ORDI project that eventually scored a Binance listing and its price soared above $20 sending its market cap to $400 million. However, others such as OXBT (Ordinals) were right behind ORDI and have enjoyed a good level of success as well. OXBT’s price rose as high as $70 before falling more than 99%. But still remains one of the largest Ordinals tokens in the market. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Spike 288%, But Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today? For OXBT, which is currently sitting at just a $4.1 million market cap, the bull narrative lies in the fact that Ordinals could make a comeback. This is not the first time that a narrative could be seen as over but yet come back stronger. Even the Ordinals have already proven this is possible. In such a case, then OXBT would be right behind ORDI and a run up to a $400 million market cap would mean a 100x, and could go higher as the bull market rolls around, performing similarly to Kaspa (KAS). “Disclaimer: The following op-ed represents the views of the author, and may not necessarily reflect the views of Bitcoinist.
