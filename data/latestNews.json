    "description": "There are a couple of events to watch out for this week, as they could prove pivotal in determining the future trajectory of the crypto market. These events could provide some certainty to the market or cause investors to wait on the sidelines for more favorable market conditions.  Events That Could Affect The Market This Week Some Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak at different events this week. One of them is Governor Lisa Cook, who will give a lecture on March 25. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also participate in a discussion at the Monetary Policy Conference on March 29.  Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed For One Week Straight – Can Price Recover To $73,000? Their speeches are significant as they could provide valuable insights into the current state of the economy and what to expect from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates in its fight against inflation. Macroeconomic factors like interest rates usually impact the crypto market and partly determine the sentiments among crypto traders. The crypto market is usually bullish whenever the Federal Reserve adopts a dovish stance on whether or not to hike interest rates. Therefore, these officials sounding positive in their speeches could help boost investors’ confidence in the crypto market since they would be less worried about things on the macro side.  Meanwhile, several economic data will be released this week, including the Consumer Confidence and Consumer Sentiment data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. These releases offer insights into the economy’s strength and guide the Fed in deciding on future interest rate decisions.  Crypto Needs A Big Win This Week Stakeholders and investors in the industry will no doubt hope that the events lined up for this week will provide a momentum boost for the crypto market. Last week was one to forget as things cooled after weeks of seeing the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, and altcoins make significant runs. This downward trend is believed to have been due to some external factors. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Says Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH By Year End, Here’s The Target One of them is the net outflows that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded throughout last week, with many investors taking profits from the various funds. These Bitcoin ETFs had previously seen an impressive amount of inflows into them, which positively affected Bitcoin’s price. As such, a trend of outflows was also expected to influence Bitcoin’s price, although negatively.  These Spot Bitcoin ETFs will again be in the spotlight this week, with the crypto community waiting to see if the sentiments among the ETF investors will change. A sustained trend of profit-taking this week could spark another decline in the crypto market.  Total market cap chart at $2.47 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com"
