Approximately $7.3M were stolen.\"</blockquote><p>The protocol filed a police report and is trying to communicate with the attackers to return the stolen assets, its team noted on X (formerly Twitter). </p><p>In another security incident, the interchain stablecoin protocol Harbor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harbor_Protocol/status/1692836252498723154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> being the victim of an attack that led to the loss of funds sitting on its stable-mint, as well as stOSMO, LUNA and WMATIC vaults.
