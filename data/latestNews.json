    "description": "Bitcoin and the crypto market continue to smash critical resistance levels and hit new yearly highs. The cryptocurrency stands closer to the $50,000 area as 2023 ends, and two major bullish catalyzers stand on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triumphs Over $41,000, But Here’s What Could Prevent $50,000 As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $41,800 with a 6% profit in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC recorded an impressive 13% rally as analysts and the crypto community celebrated the beginning of a new bull cycle. Bitcoin Whales Behind $40,000 Rally, Are More Profits In Store? Data provided by Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analysis firm CryptoQuant, indicates that Bitcoin whales have supported the current price action since August. At that time, the cryptocurrency re-took the higher area at $20,000 and stood below the critical resistance at $30,000. As Bitcoin trended to the upside, whales took on “giga long positions” potentially in preparation for the current rally. This risk-on behavior began more discretely when BTC touched $16,000. Young Ju tied the market activity to increased buying orders from US investors. On Coinbase, the price of Bitcoin “skyrocketed” in October 2023. Investors in the country have been buying more of the cryptocurrency in preparation for the spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval and the Halving event. The latter of this event is the reduction of the rewards for mining BTC. Furthermore, the CryptoQuant CEO believes retail investors have yet to board the rally. As seen in the chart below, BTC’s Realized Cap stood below 0.1, indicating “low liquidity” from retail investors in the crypto market. Game Is Not Over For BTC Additional data provided by Material Indicators confirmed the increasing buying pressure from whales. Analyst Keith Alan claimed that this behavior occurs to attract liquidity to the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When Once liquidity, mostly from retail investors, enters the market, whales can “distribute” their coins or “dump” on retail to take profit from their position. Via his X handle, the analyst stated the following regarding BTC’s potential to continue the uptrend: (…) because we now have ~$86M in near range #BTC bid liquidity, I&#8217;m considering buying this pullback because it doesn&#8217;t appear the game is over yet.
