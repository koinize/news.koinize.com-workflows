    "description": "The price of Bitcoin appears to be experiencing a bearish moment in the past few days now despite the approval of multiple Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which has raised speculations about the token&#8217;s future. Bitcoin Could See Further Collapse Bitcoinhyper, a cryptocurrency analyst, has offered his insights on the current state of Bitcoin. The analyst unveiled his predictions to the community during one of his YouTube videos. According to him, BTC is currently undergoing a decline, which could potentially lead to a further collapse in price. In the beginning, Bitcoinhyper noted an upswing in the price of Bitcoin to $49,000 following the approval of BTC spot ETFs by the SEC.  Related Reading: How Low Can Bitcoin Go? CryptoQuant Head Reveals Target However, the market did not react as anticipated, and there was a notable decline from the $49,000 price mark.  &#8220;Unfortunately, we got a significant dump, and in rejection, from $49,000,&#8221; he stated. The analyst highlighted that BTC was up for several days before the ETF approval, with experts anticipating the crypto would hit $50,000. Thus, in a surprising turn of events, the asset&#8217;s price witnessed a drop of about 16%. In spite of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, the market&#8217;s perception swiftly took an unpleasant shift. The correction took retail investors by surprise as they were unprepared since they had assumed that the price would rise. With the crypto asset experiencing such a collapse in price, it is believed that the market will see a massive liquidation. Remarkably, during this decline, liquidations were not as large as anticipated. Bitcoinhyper noted that during the decline, around $18.8 million in short positions were liquidated, which is less than expected. The news caused traders to become overconfident while ignoring the possibility of a correction. No Positive Impact On BTC Price Despite Substantial Inflow Reportedly, Bitcoin saw a whopping $1.18 billion inflow in digital assets funds worldwide following ETF approval. Despite the significant inflow of capital, the anticipated impact of boosting the price of BTC has not yet been realized. Related Reading: How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Catapult BTC Price To $500,000, According To This Crypto Trader On Monday, January 15, the price of BTC dropped below the support level of $42,000 as traders turned to Ethereum and other tokens. The approval of ETFs might be a &#8220;sell the news&#8221; moment, as BTC had dropped by 16% since the announcement. As of now, it is crucial to observe that the market is becoming less enthusiastic about Bitcoin ETFs. A lot of people are now discussing the potential for an Ethereum ETF. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $42,951, indicating a decline of over 7% in the past seven days. Its trading volume is up by 3.86% in the last 24 hours, while its market cap is up by 0.75%, according to CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
