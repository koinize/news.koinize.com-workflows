Previously Hassabis said that we could see <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-says-we-may-have-agi-in-the-next-few-years\">human-level AI emerge</a> before 2033.</p><p>The news of Gemini comes shortly after Google rushed out its own AI chatbot Bard, which rivals OpenAI’s hyped ChatGPT. However, Bard <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-chatgpt-rival-ai-faces-in-house-resistance-report\">faced internal skepticism</a> from former Google employees over “concerns for society.”</p><p>Already, Google Bard has been <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/irish-data-watchdog-blocks-google-from-launching-bard-in-the-eu-report\">blocked from launching within the European Union</a> due to regulators in Ireland accusing the company of failing to file the necessary paperwork.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-eye-traders-chatgpt-stock-picks-ai-dice-adobe-firefly/\"><strong><em>AI Eye: 25K traders bet on ChatGPT’s stock picks, AI sucks at dice throws, and more</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
