    "description": "Popular crypto analyst Xremlin, known on social platforms as @0x_gremlin, told his 104,000 followers that the altcoin season in 2024 could eclipse the monumental gains seen in 2021. Reflecting on the historical significance of major exchange listings, Xremlin emphasized, &#8220;Altseason 2024 &#62; Altseason 2021. Your bags are headed to Valhalla.&#8221; During the 2021 altseason, altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) saw a staggering 300x increase, largely attributed to listings on Tier-1 centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Coinbase, according to him. “MATIC and SOL&#8217;s 300x was fueled by Tier-1 CEX listings. Binance/Coinbase listings = Billions in retail liquidity,” the crypto analyst remarked. The core of Xremlin&#8217;s analysis hinges on the demonstrable impact that listings on premier exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have on the valuation of cryptocurrencies. According to the analyst, &#8220;These 8 altcoins [are] likely to be tradable there next → Pump by 10-50x,&#8221; highlighting the potential for immediate and substantial price increases. Related Reading: Why BlackRock Could Bet On This RWA Token: Crypto Analyst Listings often trigger price surges ranging from 3 to 10 times the pre-listing value, primarily due to the vast user bases of these platforms engaging with the newly available tokens. Xremlin further elucidated the critical role of liquidity for the long-term success of a cryptocurrency project, stating, &#8220;In the long run, having access to billions in liquidity is crucial for a project&#8217;s success.&#8221; This perspective underlines the strategic advantage gained from being listed on Tier 1 centralized exchanges (CEXs). Xremlin has identified eight altcoins that not only show promise of being listed on such exchanges but also possess the potential for dramatic value appreciation. Here&#8217;s a detailed look at the altcoins spotlighted by Xremlin: Top 8 Altcoins Not Listed On Tier-1 Crypto Exchanges NGL (ENTANGLE): Operating as an omnichain infrastructure, Entanglefi aims to revolutionize data provision to smart contracts across any blockchain.

ALPH (ALEPHIUM): Priced at $2.75 with a market cap of $203 million, Alephium stands out as a Layer 1 blockchain solution tackling the critical issues of accessibility, scalability, and security faced by decentralized applications (dApps), according to the crypto analyst.
