Once BTC hit $69,000, however, searches for “crypto jobs” eclipsed AI on two occasions: </p><blockquote>“At its peak score of 26 on both January 9 and 30, 2022, search interest in ‘Crypto Jobs’ surpassed ‘AI Jobs’, and was also 5 times higher than its baseline in January 2020.”</blockquote><p>CoinGecko’s methodology utilizes a rank scoring system to determine “search interest.” It takes into account Google Search data from around the world. However, the researchers do mention that Google isn’t the primary search engine in every geographical area, so the results may not necessarily reflect the ground truth for interest. </p><p>Notably, among the analysts’ other findings, Singapore has the highest search interest rating among all nations for both “AI jobs” and “crypto jobs” keywords.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/9-common-interview-questions-for-ai-jobs\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/9-common-interview-questions-for-ai-jobs/amp\"><strong><em>9 common interview questions for AI jobs</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "

Because it does not take custody of users’ funds, it is generally considered to be a decentralized exchange (DEX). However, it does feature a centralized order book and matching engine that allows market makers to place limit orders. This contrasts with automated market-maker DEXs like Uniswap that employ on-chain pricing algorithms to match buyers and sellers.</p><p>Version 4 of dYdX will eliminate this centralized order book and matching engine, making the exchange fully decentralized, but without relying on an automated market-maker. According to the protocol’s documentation, it will do this by running parts of the app on a separate dYdX network with its own validators, allowing the order book to be stored on-chain.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gmx-and-dydx-go-head-to-head-for-the-top-decentralized-derivatives-position\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/gmx-and-dydx-go-head-to-head-for-the-top-decentralized-derivatives-position/amp\"><strong>GMX and dYdX go head-to-head for the top decentralized derivatives position</strong></a></em></p><p>According to the announcement, users can request testnet funds to try out the app as of 17:00 UTC on July 5, allowing them to place virtual trades, view profit and loss, and perform other basic functions of the exchange. The ability to test bridging from one network to another has not yet been implemented, but will come “over the course of the public testnet.”</p><p>Once the testnet phase is completed, the protocol’s team <a href=\"https://dydx.exchange/blog/v4-milestones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">plans</a> to implement the fifth milestone of the roadmap, which will integrate stablecoins into dYdX and will add support for Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) so that Cosmos users will have access to the app. V4 is expected to launch after this final milestone is completed.</p><p>dYdX announced in April that it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-exchange-dydx-announces-winding-down-of-services-for-canadian-users\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-exchange-dydx-announces-winding-down-of-services-for-canadian-users/amp\">wind down its services</a> in Canada due to regulatory issues.
