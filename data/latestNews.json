    "description": "Luke Bryoles, a Bitcoin advocate who thinks the world&#8217;s most valuable network will save people&#8217;s energy, is bullish. On October 30, Bryoles said the coin could rally to $3 million, and all it needs is to be &#8220;100X from today.&#8221; For this reason, the crypto supporter thinks users engaging with the coin are &#8220;still early.&#8221; Is This The BTC Road To $3 Million? The Bitcoin defender said the coin has &#8220;indescribable future value,&#8221; especially compared to other centralized finance (CeFi) market metrics like market capitalization. Bitcoin is changing hands at around 2023 highs, trading above the $34,500 level, with traders and coin holders expecting more gains. The expansion of last week saw the coin extend gains, lifting higher above the $32,000 level recorded in July. Considering the associated trading volume and resulting activity following the BTC jump, more supporters expect another rally in the next few sessions.  Related Reading: RSI Records Major Golden Cross: XRP Predicted To Cross The $1 Mark In 16 Days Bitcoin is down 50% from the November 2021 peak, when prices surged to approximately $70,000. However, the coin has more than doubled after dropping to as low as $16,000 in November 2022. At spot rates, BTC has more than 100% from 2022 lows, emerging as &#8220;one of the top-performing assets.&#8221; This stellar performance, Bryoles adds, is despite Bitcoin maintaining a market cap of around $500 billion in 2023 while remaining &#8220;TINY in comparison to the world&#8217;s largest asset classes,&#8221; most of which include debt, equities, and gold. To support the hyperbolic prediction, the supporter pointed to the low Bitcoin adoption level of &#8220;0.05% and 0.5%.&#8221; An eventual increase to 10% means there will be 100X users, easily driving the coin to $3 million, though even this remains a &#8220;misleadingly pessimistic prediction,&#8221; according to Bryoles. At this valuation, the analyst added that the coin&#8217;s market cap will be &#8220;unfathomable.&#8221; Even so, all that is required is &#8220;4% of the global adult population to demand 1 million sats to exhaust exchanges.&#8221; Bitcoin Finds Support And Opposition: Will Bulls Win? Bitcoin remains the world&#8217;s most valuable crypto asset. At the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might authorize the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Analysts expect this to drive prices towards the 2021 high at around $69,000.  Related Reading: XRP Price About To See “Face Ripping” Rally, Legendary Trader Weights In Meanwhile, Federal Reserve&#8217;s Jerome Powell and SEC&#8217;s Gary Gensler think the coin is a &#8220;speculative asset.&#8221; These sentiments have also been shared by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who once said, &#8220;Bitcoin is a scam.&#8221; Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
