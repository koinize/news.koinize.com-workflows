    "description": "<p class=\"s3\">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a great future. They haven't reached their full potential yet, but they definitely will. I draw such conclusions not only from the current situation in the markets or from the systematic growth in demand for crypto, which is indeed observed. But also, by observing the positive changes in the attitude of the world's elites towards it. </p>\n<p class=\"s3\">Both financial, which already regularly report new projects like the launch of a national bitcoin exchange in Indonesia in July-2023 (confirmed by the local regulator) or the receipt of a licence to provide cryptocurrency services by a division of the French Societe Generale (SG Forge) from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which cannot but please. But also, political ones, because it is on them that legislative and regulatory decisions depend, which will allow the development of the crypto industry.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">The speech of Democratic Party member and US presidential candidate Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (nephew of the legendary 35th U.S. President John Kennedy) at an event organised by Heal-the-Divide PAC was highly inspiring. The politician openly stated that he was willing to take steps to back the U.S. national currency with Bitcoin, and this would support the dollar's status as an international reserve currency.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">Kennedy called Bitcoin a hard currency and put it on par with silver, gold, platinum, emphasising that such an approach would help \"restore the strength of the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of financial stability, peace and prosperity for the country\". This will provide at least some of the U.S. debt obligations (treasuries) with hard assets, increasing confidence in them.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">Not only has the Democrat recognised the power of bitcoin and publicly reiterated the thesis of many crypto-activists, but he has also made it clear that he is ready to make crypto-assets a tool of public policy. This is a serious acknowledgement, which could translate into a large-scale project centered on the U.S. and the world's key currency, the dollar. </p>\n<p class=\"s3\">The second important thesis of Robert F. Kennedy concerns taxation. He announced that his administration would \"exempt the conversion of Bitcoins to the U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes.\" In May, the American authorities had already abandoned the idea of imposing an additional 30% tax on industrial mining of cryptocurrencies, and now they are ready to liberalise the capital gains part. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the market, which in the U.S. is now on the brink and is very much hoping for positive changes. It is known that many have even considered the option of migration from the U.S. And so now Kennedy's statement will be received very well.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">By the way, the presidential candidate does not just throw promises, but justifies them. It can be seen that the politician follows the situation in the industry and sentiments. Since he says that tax breaks will allow the development of jobs in the U.S. and not in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal. He is aware about the negative sentiment in cryptocurrency circles.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">At the moment, there are few options left in the United States that minimise taxation and do not violate current legislation. The most common are transactions through people's retirement accounts and working through the Puerto Rico, where corporations can enjoy a favourable tax rate of 4% and ordinary investors can work as qualified residents and receive a tax exemption. However, these options are not suitable for everyone. Therefore, crypto investors are increasingly looking at the possibility of working in Singapore, Portugal, Malta, and in some cases Hong Kong. There, the issue of taxation is solved more easily. </p>\n<p class=\"s3\">Robert F. Kennedy repeated his old thesis that cryptocurrencies give people freedom, freedom of choice and will. Something he spoke about at the conference in Miami (USA) in May 2023, when he recalled the story of truckers' strikes in Canada. People weren't breaking local laws, but the authorities pressed on by blocking their personal bank accounts to subjugate them - they were deprived of the ability to support their families and pay their mortgages. In fact, these are financial repressions that were applied at the state level.This is essentially financial repression that was applied at the state level. What could not have been realised with the adequate development of cryptocurrencies that can protect citizens and their freedom.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">Freedom of money is also freedom of speech and expression of will. And these are cryptocurrencies that can provide all this, but not fiat currencies, total financial monitoring and requirements for classical financial institutions.</p>\n<p class=\"s3\">All of this has been talked about many times at crypto conferences and conventions. It is encouraging that this has finally been heard and realised by politicians at the highest level, and, most importantly, that they are not just talking, but are ready to act decisively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/european-central-bank-25-bps-hike/",
    "description": "On Thursday, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it was raising “three key ECB interest rates” by 25 basis points (BPS) in a move similar to the one taken by the United States Federal Reserve.  The US Federal Reserve, on Wednesday, increased its fund rates by an additional 25 BPS, its highest interest rate in 22 years. European Central Bank In The Fight Against Inflation The European Central Bank, in its statement, admitted that although inflation continues to decline, it is “still expected to remain too high for too long.” In a bid to fight inflation and return it to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner, the governing council has continued to hike the interest rates for some time now, and this has further raised concerns for investors in the financial market as to whether or not there will be hikes before year ends.  Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders For context, the ECB has raised rates by 4.00% since last year July, accounting for the fastest-tightening cycle in its history. It is projected that this rapid increase in rates could negatively affect the expansion of loans in the European region and economic activity also.  A quarterly poll released by the ECB on July 25 revealed that the companies’ demand for loans plunged to its lowest in the second quarter of this year. The eurozone has less developed and liquid capital markets than the United States, so there is an overreliance on banks in financing the economy.  And now, according to ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, the tighter monetary policy is massively impacting bank loans. So such policies will undoubtedly cause a liquidity squeeze.  Bitcoin’s Role Although inflation continues to decline, it is evident that the ECB and US Federal Reserve aren’t getting the desired results as to the target to which they want to bring inflation down to. As such, these financial bodies may continue increasing the rates to as high as possible despite the dramatic economic slowdown.  Investors are aware of this position and are looking toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for succor. For a long time now, Bitcoin has been tagged as a ‘hedge against inflation,’ and it seems that many are realizing that this is more than a tag as Bitcoin has remained stable despite the growing rates, which many would have expected would send Bitcoin and the crypto market spiraling down.  Related Reading: Short-Lived Hype: Worldcoin (WLD) Signups Dwindle Less Than A Week After Launch Unlike the United States, European investors are lucky to have more regulatory certainty in the region. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation offers a sense of direction to stakeholders in the European crypto industry. This will help businesses and investors navigate their way when operating and dealing with crypto assets.  BTC price sitting at $29,300 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from PYMNTS, chart from Tradingview.com"
