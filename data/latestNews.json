Multichain (MULTI) was launched in 2020 on the 20th of July to provide solutions for various blockchains, especially regarding their communication needs. </p>\n<p>With &nbsp;Mulltichain (MULTI), every blockchain has its community, unique services, and development ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Multichain (MULTI) is selling at $4.33 and is predicted to reach $7.42 by 2024 if its community grows at the current pace.</p>\nUwerx (WERX): ​The Freelancers&rsquo; Community\n<p>Uwerx is set to be launched on the 4th of August, 2023. Over the months, and during its presale, Uwerx has released several mouthwatering updates about the platform and its launching, leaving freelancers and crypto investors eagerly anticipating.</p>\n<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform that will provide freelancers with a perfect virtual world to work in and provide crypto investors with a stable and profitable investment choice. For freelancers, the Uwerx team has emphasized that Uwerx is to become the freelancer&rsquo;s first choice. With its 1% flat fee, unlike the ludicrous 10% and 20% fees offered by other freelancing platforms, Uwerx is ready to put its money where its mouth&rsquo;s at.</p>\n<p>A blaring green light for crypto investors about Uwerx is its successful audit approval by both InterFi Network and SolidProof. This audit approval alone shows interested crypto investors that Uwerx is that token! Uwerx will be renouncing its contract ownership once it&rsquo;s launched on the 4th of August, 2023, and this will be done to ensure the prevention of all cryptocurrency-related scams and frauds. </p>\n<p>Perhaps these positive updates about the upcoming platform are the secrets behind Uwerx&rsquo;sgrowing numbers. Uwerx is making great steps to ensure that these figures have extra zeroes at their end before Q4 2024. Uwerx has already been listed on CoinSniper and will soon be listed on Uniswap by the 1st of August, 2023. </p>\n<p>Also, to ensure that the WERX tokens are protected, Uwerx will implement a 25-year liquidity lock before the end of its presale. Uwerx will also be launching a Test Airdrop for its users before the 31st of July, 2023, the scheduled date for the end of Uwerx&rsquo;s hard cap presale. To further provide Uwerx users with extra security, the Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled. Storing your WERX tokens in the Uwerx Vault works just like staking, and you can store your tokens for different periods and earn rewards depending on Uwerx&rsquo;s variables. </p>\n<p>The Uwerx team is working on releasing the Alpha platform in phases. The PDF Version of these pages has now been released: the Signing-Up Page, the Logging-In page, and the job creation process, amongst others. Soon, Uwerx will be transitioning from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform, so users can try out the platform for themselves while sharing their observations with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>\nUwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Shoots Higher\n<p>The Uwerx Presale has not stopped soaring since its start.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/5-crypto-picks-for-100x-returns-that-meme-coin-lovers-cant-miss",
    "description": "<p class=\"s5\">Meme coins have a robust reputation for their potential to deliver huge returns on investment over a short period of time. Meme coin lovers are attracted by projects that could experience exponential growth, leading to high returns overnight. However, finding the right projects is not such an easy task, especially as more and more coins appear on the market each day.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">To help you out, we&rsquo;ve done the research on your behalf and we discovered the best altcoins to buy with huge potential for growth in the next period. Here are the 5 crypto picks for 100x returns that currently generate hype and attention within the community: DigiToads (TOADS), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monacoin (MONA).</p>\n<p>DigiToads</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">DigiToads is one of the few presales this year that have generated huge buzz in the media. However, TOADS is more than a simple meme coin. In fact, this coin departs from the purely speculative business model and puts forward a robust ecosystem with plenty of opportunities to generate returns both actively and passively.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">DigiToads combines a play-to-earn gaming universe with a stake-to-earn rare feature. These core elements attract gaming enthusiasts, who get to play with digital toads in an immersive world to earn TOADS in gaming competitions, but also long-term investors, who can buy TOADS and use them to purchase and stake trending NFTs in return for regular passive income.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Perhaps another crucial aspect is the deflationary nature of the TOADS ERC20 coins. This leads to the scarcity effect, unlike other inflationary coins, which means that TOADS holders do not only stand to benefit from value appreciation but also enjoy the potential for long-term passive returns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"s11\">FLOKI</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">FLOKI started out as a joke coin, but the dev team decided to expand into key areas like decentralized finance, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Despite being relatively new, just like TOADS, FLOKI is expected by experts to deliver significant growth and success in the next year.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The crypto project differentiates itself from other meme coins. Just like TOADS, it focuses on real-life use cases, which are expected to keep generating demand for the token.</p>\n<p class=\"s11\">Shiba Inu</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Shiba Inu has been at the top of the list for quite some time now. Despite some bumps down the road this year, SHIB is still expected to live up to its reputation. The purpose of SHIB is to become one of the main decentralized cryptocurrencies that focus on a fun community of users.</p>\n<p class=\"s11\">Dogecoin </p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Dogecoin&rsquo;s cultural appeal has remained unaltered thanks to its lighthearted origin. Just like SHIB, a key driver for growth for this meme coin is the internet meme that has created a strong community. Also, DOGE has enjoyed multiple celebrity endorsements, with figures prominent in business, entertainment, and crypto industries offering attention to this meme coin.</p>\n<p class=\"s11\">Monacoin</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Monacoin first appeared in Japan and garnered attention after appearing on a Japanese TV network, where land was purchased using MONA. Monacoin is essentially a payment network that facilitates P2P transactions.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">One of the earliest meme coins, Monacoin enjoys a huge appeal, particularly in the Japanese crypto community. In addition to this, while some meme coins lack utility, MONA is used for multiple purposes, including tipping, donations, or as a means of exchange.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"s11\">Summary</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The rise of meme coins has taken many by surprise. Among the top contenders, DigiToadsstands out for its unique approach that combines play-to-earn gaming and a stake-to-earn mechanism with multiple community contests and awards.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">As the meme coin landscape evolves, investors and traders are becoming more discerning than ever. The meme coin market offers huge potential for excitement, adrenaline, and gains, but it&rsquo;s important to focus on projects like DigiToads with robust growth potential and a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>Visit DigiToads Presale</p>\n<p>Mint DigiToads NFTs Here</p>\n<p>Buy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea</p>\n<p>Join the community&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "On July 13, Ripple triumphed significantly in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the XRP case. Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in a case originally initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities In recently filed documents on July 13, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment, decisively supporting payment company Ripple and its claim over the SEC. The judgment affirms that XRP token sales made by the payment company, at the center of the case, are not classified as a security. The decision immediately impacted the XRP price, which surged over 35% in the wake of the ruling. The ruling cleared a substantial part of Ripple&#8217;s operations from being targeted by the SEC&#8217;s crackdown. The court&#8217;s decision acknowledged that the Programmatic Sales and sales made by Ripple executives Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse do not qualify as investment contracts. However, the ruling only partially resolves the legal dispute with the SEC. The court has invalidated the investment contract designation for Programmatic Sales and other forms of distributions, but other items remain disputed. The value of XRP has surged from $0.45 to $0.62. This price surge has caused XRP to reach a yearly high. The coin attained this price level in early May of the preceding year. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart On the daily chart, XRP has experienced an impressive 34% increase, trading at $0.62. Over the week, XRP has gained nearly 30%. However, as of the time of writing, the token was considered oversold. It suggests that a price retracement may be possible in the upcoming trading sessions. In the past, when XRP reached $0.60, the price suffered a sharp drop shortly after that. The coin faces overhead resistance at $0.67. Moving above this level could help XRP retain its gains for longer. If there is a price pullback, the first line of support is $0.57. A drop below this level would take XRP down to $0.50. The technical outlook indicates excessive bullish strength, with demand and accumulation showing significant positivity. The Relative Strength Index is above 80, which suggests that the token is overbought and overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a price retracement. However, demand is expected to remain positive if the price stays above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (red), which coincides with the $0.58 price mark.
