At the time of the accident, the amount was worth around $50,000.</p><p>“I accidentally showed my private key live and the person had really quickly sent it to another address. I tried to close the broadcast and send crypto to another address but I was too late,” Bianco said in the emotional video that followed the accident.</p><p>In the video, the streamer <a href=\"https://polygonscan.com/address/0x20dee7da6196e18468135764bf12079935948e5e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">provided</a> the link to the Polygon address of the unknown perpetrator. The 86,000 MATIC stash then started to be transferred across different addresses.</p><p>Bianco claimed that he lost his entire life savings to the accident, pleading with the stream viewer to return the money for a reward. The YouTuber also said that he was planning to file a complaint to the local police, noting that about 70 people were watching his unfortunate live stream.</p><p>According to some online sources, Fraternidade Crypto might have managed to retrieve at leastsome of his funds so far. Local crypto executive Guilherme Rennó took to X (formerly Twitter) on Aug. 30 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RennoGuil/status/1696861551423103097?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a> that there have been rumors that Bianco eventually managed to recover a “good part of the money.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-ways-to-store-private-keys\"><strong><em>7 ways to safely store your private keys</em></strong></a></p><p>“Self-custody is something that demands extreme care,” the exec noted, adding that crypto users should never store their seeds and passwords on their computers or in an easy accessible place.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/93e06642-f85d-4337-8f67-fb408353baf3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Online reports suggest that Fraternidade Crypto recovered a part of the stolen assets.

It's crucial to be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-self-custody-a-fundamental-human-right-but-not-risk-free-community\">very careful with handling a private key</a> or a seed phrase and for some, it might be a better idea to opt for non-custodial solutions like exchanges instead. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts recommend investors to diversify the types of cryptocurrency storage in order to prevent losses of one's entire life savings as well.</p><p>While self-custody allows users to essentially “be their own bank,” such a method of holding crypto is still prone to many risks such as theft, destruction or loss. “Not your keys, not your coins,” is a popular expression in the cryptocurrency community that warns users about such risks. Once a self-custody wallet user gets a private key exposed to someone else, that user is no longer the owner of the funds, according to the rules of crypto.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
