    "description": "Bitcoin price is slowly moving lower below the $28,500 level. BTC could drop toward the $28,000 level or the 100 hourly SMA before the bulls take a stand. Bitcoin is struggling to gain traction for a move above the $28,500 level. The price is trading above $27,750 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $28,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could revisit the 100 hourly Simple moving average before it attempts a fresh increase. Bitcoin Price Extends Downside Correction Bitcoin price started a downside correction from the $30,000 resistance zone.
