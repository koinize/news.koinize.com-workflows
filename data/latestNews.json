This means Android users will now have access to this AI sidekick 24/7, just like iOS users who have been enjoying it since May.</p><p>The company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1682480558545461249\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tweeted</a> the upcoming release of ChatGPT for Android, scheduled for the following week, without specifying the exact day. They provided a preorder page in the Google Play Store, allowing users to register for installation once the app is ready. ChatGPT's iOS app was launched in May with the promise of an Android version, which is now coming to fruition.</p><p>This announcement follows OpenAI's recent efforts <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-companies-commit-safe-and-transparent-ai-white-house-reports\">to enhance the safety and transparency</a> of its systems, including initiatives like content watermarking. The company has been under scrutiny due to concerns about <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-how-openai-plans-to-cleanse-chatgpt-from-false-information\">misinformation generated by its AI</a> and its potential misuse for cheating. While these powerful generative models offer significant benefits, responsible and ethical implementation remains crucial.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Announcing ChatGPT for Android!

It will also offer features such as conversation history synchronization across devices, similar to the existing iOS app.</p><p>By introducing its native Android and iOS app, OpenAI directly competes with Microsoft's Bing Chat, which also utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 technology. This app serves as an alternative means to test the large language model (LLM) without relying on a web browser.</p><p>The release timing coincides with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-s-bard-overcomes-eu-hurdles-expands-territories-and-capabilities\">Google revealing its Bard chatbot</a> and other tech giant's entry into the AI sector. Additionally, numerous startups, like Anthropic with Claude 2 assistant, are emerging rapidly, offering functionalities surpassing OpenAI's paid version of ChatGPT.
