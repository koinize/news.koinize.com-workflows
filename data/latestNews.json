The SEC asked the judge to put the case on hold while the appeal is in progress. </p><p>The SEC’s move to appeal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoonLamboio/status/1689413338508259329\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sparked</a> questions among community members, with some thinking that the SEC’s move to appeal is a move to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">challenge the “non-security” status of XRP</a>. However, crypto lawyers assured the community that this is not the case. </p><p>According to crypto lawyer Jeremy Hogan, the two issues are separate. Hogan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1689426536917610502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">explained</a> that if the SEC wins the appeal on the sales, Ripple would not be able to facilitate sales using exchanges. Despite this, the lawyer believes that exchanges could keep XRP listed as long as the sales are not made by Ripple. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/f3b13bea-5b73-4adb-a0f3-1fa7d6ad2127.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hogan’s thoughts on the Ripple case.

However, the SEC’s appeal is interlocutory, meaning it wants to appeal even though the case is unfinished. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The SEC does not have the “right” to appeal just yet which is why they are asking permission to file an “interlocutory” appeal.

He explained:</p><blockquote>“The SEC is asking to pause the XRP case while the interlocutory appeal goes on. If the appeal is allowed, whoever wins the appeal builds momentum in the main case.” </blockquote><p>While Hogan believes that the appeal will not affect XRP's status as a non-security, Tan believes that this is still what the SEC is after. Tan believes that the SEC is still looking to overturn the decision that XRP is not a security back in July. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-joins-bis-cross-border-payments-task-force\"><strong><em>Ripple joins BIS cross-border payments task force</em></strong></a></p><p>Tan also explained that at the moment, the SEC is using the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-denies-motion-dismiss-terraform-sec-case-reject-ripple-ruling\">conclusion in the Terraform Labs case</a> against the judge in the XRP case. The crypto lawyer said that the SEC is arguing that a higher court should \"break the tie\" among the different conclusions. However, Tan believes that the SEC should let the court process proceed normally. He explained: </p><blockquote>“What the SEC should have done is to provide clearer guidance before taking anyone to court. Since Ripple and other parties decided to take the SEC to court to get this guidance, the SEC should let the court process proceed normally.” </blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty told the community to “stay tuned” and noted that Ripple will file its response with the court next week. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sec-reviews-ripple-ruling-us-bill-seeks-control-over-defi-and-more-hodlers-digest-july-16-22/\"><strong><em>SEC reviews Ripple ruling, US bill seeks control over DeFi, and more: Hodler’s Digest</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
