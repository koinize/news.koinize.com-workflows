Let's take a closer look at the charts. </p><h2>Ethereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin</h2><p>The ETH/BTC pair dropped to as low as 0.056 BTC earlier this week. In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.</p><p>The 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3e011dc2-a5c8-4a17-933f-391e7bd3ef8a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/BTC weekly price chart.

In this case, the next downside target looks to be around its 0.5 Fib line near 0.051 BTC in 2023, down about 9.5% from current price levels.</p><p>Conversely, ETH price may rebound toward its 50-week EMA (the red wave) near 0.065 BTC if it reclaims the 200-week EMA as support.</p><h2>Bitcoin bull case overshadows Ethereum</h2><p>Ethereum's persistent weakness versus Bitcoin is reflected in institutional capital flow data. </p><p>For instance, as of Oct. 6, Bitcoin-specific investment funds had attracted $246 million year-to-date (YTD), according to <a href=\"https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-152-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-2dc8d161b9d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CoinShares</a>. On the other hand, Ethereum funds have lost capital, witnessing outflows worth $104 million in the same period.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/64ba8600-b4c5-446b-b4eb-a20ab12d277e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Net flows into crypto funds (by asset).
