Regulatory bodies worldwide have been increasingly vigilant in addressing potential risks and ensuring compliance within the crypto space. </p><p>One notable aspect of this regulatory focus is the imposition of fines and penalties on individuals and companies involved in various crypto-related activities. Here’s how the landscape has transformed since 2018, leading to increasing regulation in 2023.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/0babf15e-632d-4855-b4b0-424ac6cceaa3.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Increasing regulatory scrutiny</h2><p>Since 2018, there has been a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-s-war-on-crypto-how-far-will-it-go\">substantial rise in the number of regulatory actions</a> and fines imposed on entities operating in the crypto sector, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/number-of-uk-crypto-firms-operating-under-fca-temporary-registration-status-drops\">strengthening their enforcement efforts</a> with the aim to protect investors and maintain market integrity.</p><p>The expansion of regulatory frameworks, particularly those <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-council-approves-mica-regulations\">aimed at cryptocurrencies</a>, has been a prominent development in 2023. They often include provisions <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230327IPR78511/new-eu-measures-against-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">related</a> to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, investor protection, and disclosure obligations. Implementing these regulations has enabled authorities to take a stronger stance against noncompliant individuals and companies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/5daca409-8746-472d-8b6e-03ef7bcd3242.jpg\"  /></figure><p>The shift toward an individual-focused approach with a strong interest in the crypto sector has played a crucial role in driving the increase in enforcement actions and fines. By imposing fines on fraudulent <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-98\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">activities</a>, scams and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/steven-seagal-charged-by-sec-for-promoting-2018-ico\">unlawful touting</a>, regulators aim to create a safer investment environment and deter bad actors from operating within the industry.</p><h2>Notable cases and trends</h2><p>Throughout this period, several high-profile cases have emerged involving celebrities, influencers and companies promoting cryptocurrencies without proper disclosures or engaging in fraudulent activities — such as those involving <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-charges-floyd-mayweather-jr-and-dj-khaled-for-unlawfully-promoting-ico\">Floyd Mayweather Jr., DJ Khaled</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-issues-warning-to-celebrities-promoting-crypto-amid-latest-enforcement-action\">Paul Pierce</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kim-kardashian-pays-sec-1-26-million-to-settle-ethereummax-charge\">Kim Kardashian</a>. These cases have demonstrated the consequences of misleading the public regarding endorsements in the crypto space, serving as a wake-up call for both regulators and investors and highlighting the importance of transparency and due diligence.</p><p class=\"post-content__accent post-content__accent_small\"><a href=\"https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/detail/crypto-fines-database\">Explore the Crypto Fines Database by Cointelegraph Research</a></p><p>Additionally, the rise of initial coin offerings a few years ago led to a surge in regulatory actions targeting projects that failed to comply with securities laws. Many ICOs were deemed <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-scuppers-shipchain-s-27m-ico-and-fines-the-firm-its-last-2m\">unregistered securities offerings</a>, resulting in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rapper-t-i-s-associates-to-cough-up-100k-in-flik-token-case-with-sec\">fines, penalties</a>, and even the shutdown of specific projects.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/60cd118a-9011-4fb5-8196-a7ecaa710394.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Implications</h2><p>The landscape of crypto fines has changed substantially since 2018, reflecting the industry’s growing maturity and increasing regulatory scrutiny. Heightened enforcement efforts, expanding regulatory frameworks, and a focus on crypto users signify a shift toward a more regulated, responsible crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Regulations are continually tightening and evolving rapidly, with an increasing emphasis on AML/KYC compliance; hence, it’s vital to stay aware and navigate this changing landscape effectively.

    "description": "The founder of the Cardano blockchain, Charles Hoskinson, took to Twitter to inform investors of a new scam scheme that has suddenly emerged focusing solely on ADA holders. According to Hoskinson, the scammers impersonate him to send messages to members of the ADA community. Related Reading: Bedrock Upgrade: How Optimism Game-Changer Could Impact OP Price In the post, the Cardano founder reiterated that he would &#8220;never email ADA holders directly.&#8221; He also disclosed that scammers have been trying different tactics to impersonate him and defraud ADA investors of their funds. Scammers Target ADA Community Members Hoskinson discovered the ongoing scam tactic through an unknown ADA enthusiast who contacted him about the malicious scheme. The ADA user reported that while impersonating him, the scammers sent emails concerning a newly launched project, the &#8220;Hoskinson Health and Wellness Clinic.&#8221;  The scammers wrote that the launch of the medical facility is part of Hoskinson’s vision to build a &#8220;strong&#8221; ecosystem for Cardano.  They also noted that the medical center, based in Wyoming, will include ADA as a payment option. The scammers’ emails mentioned that lives are easily lost when people fail to disclose their medical details on time.  So, they stated that easy availability and accessibility of medical information through innovative technology like Cardano would help to save more lives promptly. Related Reading: XRP Climbs 12% As Crypto Celebrates 11-Year Milestone Further, the malicious email stated that the newly launched medical facility is the first medical multichain on the Cardano network. It mentioned that the impact of such a project on the blockchain ecosystem and in life could scale quite high once this kind of project reaches its peak. Finally, the email persuaded ADA investors to research the medical chain project more while increasing their investment holdings in ADA. Hoskinson Offers Some Tips To Identify Scammers While notifying the investors about the ongoing scam, Hoskinson laid out some tips on identifying scammers. Hoskinson noted that the tips would help to fish out those impersonating the Cardano founder. The founder advises members of the ADA community to verify the identity of senders of suspicious emails by requesting them to do so. To ensure security, the verification process should involve obtaining Hoskinson&#8217;s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key signature. Hoskinson has confirmed that scammers cannot replicate this signature. PGP keys are public encryption keys designed for the specific purposes of encrypting or signing emails, files, and directories. When you create a PGP key, the system generates a public and private key pair, enabling you to receive an encrypted message and open it. But you can send the public key to the sender and use your private key to decrypt the message when it comes. In that case, someone impersonating you cannot produce your public key, as Hoskinson pointed out. Meanwhile, ADA is trading at around $0.3748 when writing, indicating a drop of 1.78% over the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap is about $ 13.07 billion.
