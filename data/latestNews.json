    "description": "Bitcoin began 2024 with a blast gaining by over 73% in the first quarter of the year to establish a new all-time high price of $73,750. And although BTC soon declined from this value following a turbulent price movement in the last month, its biggest stakeholders have shown a consistent accumulation trend throughout the first three months of 2024, indicating a high confidence in the asset‚Äôs profitability ahead of the upcoming halving event.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Recovery Rally: Breaking Through This Level Is Key To Bullish Momentum ‚Äì Analyst Bitcoin Whales Acquire $21.6 Billion BTC, Boost Market Dominance By 1.4% As Halving Nears In an X post on Friday, blockchain analytics platform Santiment shared that Bitcoin whales are still maintaining the ‚Äúright direction‚Äù in regard to their accumulation pattern. Santiment reported that these whales, which represent holders of 100-100,000 BTC, purchased a total of 319,310 BTC (valued at $21.6 billion) in the last three months.¬† This report also stated that a significant portion of the newly acquired tokens came from retail traders, i.e., holders of 0-100 BTC, who collectively offloaded 105,260 BTC, valued at $7.2 billion and 0.7% of BTC‚Äôs circulating supply, within the same time frame. üê≥‚ÜóÔ∏è #Bitcoin&#8216;s key stakeholders with 100-100K $BTC have ACCUMULATED a collective 319,310 $BTC (around 1.4% of the supply) in the past 3 months. Many of these coins came from 0-100 $BTC wallets, which have DUMPED 105,260 $BTC (-0.7% of supply) in 3 months. https://t.co/6KKFgZzrPz‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/kXyQrOIRGA ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 5, 2024 In general, BTC whales increased their market share by 1.4% in the last three months, which is interpreted as a rather positive sign ahead of the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving on April 19. For context, the Bitcoin halving, which occurs every four years, is a network-programmed event during which the amount of miners&#8217; rewards on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half.¬† Generally, the Bitcoin halving is regarded as a positive event that results in asset scarcity, thus driving up demand and market price in the long term. This notion may just remain true as Santiment describes the increased accumulation by BTC whales heading into the final weeks before the next halving as a bullish signal, indicating high confidence in the asset‚Äôs future valuation.
