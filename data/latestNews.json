That numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, including BAM, have operated in the United States for years without interference by the SEC belies the claim that they are clearly covered by the securities laws,\" wrote the filing. </p><p>Furthermore, Binance.US said that it had made “significant efforts” to cooperate with an ongoing SEC investigation that began on Dec. 20, 2020. According to the filing, the results of this investigation have yielded more than 700,000 individual communications and “bespoke data” on its day-to-day operations.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we charged Binance Holdings Ltd.
