Individual investors include Bo Feng of Dragonfly Capital, Riyad AD of Saudi Arabia, and Suji Yan of Mask Network. According to developers, the funds will be primarily used to develop Tabi’s gaming ecosystem and construct its upcoming on-chain identity protocol.</p><p>Aside from its NFT trading and launchpad features, Tabi converts users’ on-chain activities into “experience points,” which can be exchanged for future airdrop rewards and earnings. The protocol also contains a gaming platform that aggregates blockchain game transactions and entertainment. </p><p>In addition, Tabi founder Xavier Lee said the project plans to launch an “NFT incubation fund” that would incentivize developers to design their products, arts, and brand on the BNB Chain. The project was established in 2021. To reward its early supporters, Tabi says it is launching a “reward plan” on the same day of the funding announcement. </p><p>Binance has increased its NFTs-related operations this year. On March 2, the cryptocurrency exchange’s native NFT AI generator, dubbed “Bicasso,” hit its minting cap of 10,000 less than three hours after launch. On March 8, Binance announced it would integrate Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) support into its NFT marketplace. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here’s a fun new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Binance</a> AI product called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bicasso?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bicasso</a> <br><br>You can turn your creative visions into NFTs with AI.
