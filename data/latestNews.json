The entrepreneur suggested five reasons he believes “being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024.”</p><p>First, Armstrong wrote that 52 million U.S. citizens hold crypto. Second, 38% of young people believe crypto can increase economic opportunities. Also, crypto prices are up 90% year-to-date, while only 9% of Americans are “satisfied with the current financial system.” The fifth reason, according to Armstrong, is that the Stand With Crypto Alliance, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit advocating the crypto industry among elected politicians, is “on its way” to one million supporters. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-anti-crypto-bad-political-strategy\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
