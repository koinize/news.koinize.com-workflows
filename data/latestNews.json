This led to the ecosystem‚Äôs governance token, OP, enjoying an increase in price, albeit a modest 3.7% in the past 24 hours. This price movement only came after last month‚Äôs dismal performance where OP dropped by over 30% in the monthly timeframe. With the promise of lower fees along with Ethereum-like security for the coming upgrade, we might see OP continue its present bullishness.
