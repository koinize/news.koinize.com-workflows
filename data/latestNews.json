However, the price quickly turned around and fell back below $35,000 signaling that the breakout may have been a fake move.</p><p>A mild correction during an uptrend does not signal a trend change. It is generally a healthy sign as it shakes out weak hands. When markets are trending higher, dips are viewed as a buying opportunity, but it is better to wait for the price to find a bottom before buying. Strong support levels could be watched as potential places where buyers step in to arrest the decline.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/47a40723-d115-46f4-946e-fe637e497f7d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

What are the important support levels where the decline could end?</p><p>Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin surged above $35,280 on Nov. 1 and tried to build upon this rally on Nov. 2 but the bears had other plans. Sellers stalled the up-move at $35,985 and are trying to sustain the price below $35,000.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/40a8ab55-8c44-4351-9b8b-c461b8d5e267.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair may skid to $33,390. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if $33,390 cracks, the pair may fall to the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,611).</p><p>Generally, in an uptrend, the bulls fiercely defend the 20-day EMA. If the level holds, it will indicate that the trend remains positive. The bulls will then make one more attempt to kick the price to $40,000.</p><p>A break and close below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls may be losing their grip. The pair may then tumble to $31,000.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>The bulls nudged Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) above the immediate resistance at $1,865 on Nov. 2 but the bears pulled the price back below the level, indicating strong selling at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/1e70b1de-02aa-4661-951b-75d4c309e021.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support at $1,746. This remains the key level to keep an eye on because a break and close below it will signal that the bears are back in the driver’s seat.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bulls are likely to have other plans. They will try to buy the dips and again attempt to overcome the obstacle at $1,865. If they can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair could start a rally to the psychologically critical level of $2,000. </p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) bounced off the breakout level of $223 on Nov. 1, indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending this level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/3d841416-982d-4166-adbc-ca92173d70d0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers tried to thrust the price above the $235 resistance on Nov. 2 but the bears held their ground. This suggests that the BNB/USDT pair is stuck between $223 and $235 for some time.</p><p>The rising 20-day EMA ($223) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bulls kick the price above $235, the pair may jump to $250 and eventually to $265. Conversely, the trend will shift in favor of the bears if they sink and sustain the price below $223. </p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) is facing resistance near $0.61 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not lost ground to the bears.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/f1b6e7db-a78c-48f3-b6ec-4296a0e9e700.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The buyers will try to drive the price to the overhead resistance at $0.67. This level may again pose a strong challenge to the buyers but if they bulldoze their way through, the rally could extend to $0.75 and subsequently to $0.85. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.56) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in control.</p><p>If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to yank the price back below $0.56. The XRP/USDT pair may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($0.52).</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) climbed above $38.79 on Nov. 1 and reached near the target objective at $48 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at this level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/18d048e8-0aa6-4a2d-950a-d6b18a3d8224.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart.

The bears will try to build upon their advantage and sink the SOL/USDT pair below $38.79. </p><p>If they succeed, it could start a downward move toward the 20-day EMA ($32.41). Such a deep correction will suggest an end to the up-move in the near term. The pair may then enter a consolidation phase for a few days.</p><p>If bulls want to maintain their advantage, they will have to defend the $38.79 support. If the price turns up from this level with strength, the pair may retest the overhead resistance at $48.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) snapped back from the 20-day EMA ($0.28) on Nov. 1 and rose above $0.30, indicating that the bulls are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/b750d838-e959-442c-a40e-00034fb0e483.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart.

This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up-move to continue. The target on the upside is $0.38.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns lower and breaks below $0.30, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the higher levels. The ADA/USDT pair could then slump to the 20-day EMA ($0.28).</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.06) on Nov. 1 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/fc07ec60-8f71-4a72-ae72-21cd55301d7d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart.

Buyers are again attempting to propel the price above $0.07. If they are successful, the DOGE/USDT pair will attempt a rally to $0.08. This level may again witness strong selling by the bears.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price once again turns down from $0.07, it will signal that bears are selling on rallies. A break and close below the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then tumble to $0.06.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-disappoints-while-markets-pro-delivers-88-gains-in-29-hours\"><strong><em>Bitcoin disappoints while Markets Pro delivers 88% gains in 29 hours</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) rose to the overhead resistance of $2.31 on Nov. 2 but the bulls could not overcome the obstacle. This suggests that the bears are defending the level with vigor.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/264cfae7-df58-47a8-a2a8-0d5919094ac1.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart.

A strong rebound off the moving averages will improve the prospects of a rally above $2.31. If this level is scaled, the TON/USDT pair could start its journey toward $2.59.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the pair may swing between $1.89 and $2.31 for a few days.</p><h2>Chainlink price analysis</h2><p>Chainlink (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/chainlink-price-index\">LINK</a>) has been facing resistance near $11.50, indicating that the bears have not given up and continue to sell on rallies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/4ea0ec1f-a784-4152-9c7a-7383a78818db.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AlinkUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The failure to sustain the higher levels may have tempted short-term traders to book profits on Nov. 2. That pulled the price back toward the 20-day EMA ($10.11). This remains the key level to watch out for on the downside.</p><p>If the rebound off the 20-day EMA sustains, it will suggest strong demand at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to rise above $11.50. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair may surge to $13.50 and subsequently to $15. Contrarily, a slide below the 20-day EMA may result in a retest of $9.50.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) has been moving up gradually but the rally lacks momentum. This shows hesitation among the bulls to continue buying at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/c74ae06e-9fda-4b56-8a5d-7c078bfb7fcf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart.

If bulls clear the overhead hurdle at $0.70, the MATIC/USDT pair could rally to $0.74 and then to $0.80.</p><p>The bears are currently posing a strong challenge near the overhead resistance at $0.70 but they will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.61) to weaken the bullish momentum. The pair may then oscillate inside the large range between $0.50 and $0.70 for a while.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The jury delivered its verdict in less than 10 minutes after nearly four hours of deliberation, leaving his parents to fall silent in the crowded courtroom at the Southern District Court of New York. </p><p>Over the course of his lengthy trial, my thoughts kept returning to: <em>How did you come to be here? Could all of this harm have been prevented? What can we do to avoid the next FTX? </em></p><p>Some say that existing financial regulations could have prevented the collapse of FTX. Having to comply with regulatory requirements, Bankman-Fried would never have been able to commingle and embezzle customer funds.</p><p>FTX used Alameda Research as a “payment processor,” as described by Bankman-Fried’s defense. One of Alameda’s subsidiaries, Northern Dimension, had received deposits from FTX customers since the exchange was founded. Without any corporate control, the companies commingled funds. </p><p>Commingling of funds may not necessarily involve fraudulent intent, but it can still be problematic due to the lack of transparency and accountability. In fact, it’s a “dirty word” in securities law, an attorney observing Bankman-Fried’s trial explained.</p><p>Embezzlement, on the other hand, typically involves intentional and fraudulent actions and occurs when one in control of funds uses the capital for personal gain or unauthorized purposes. Bankman-Fried, according to prosecutors, used billions of dollars in venture capital investments, real estate acquisitions and political donations for personal gain. None of these funds belonged to him. </p><p>Without corporate controls, his defense couldn’t prove that the $8 billion missing from clients was the result of the market downturn rather than the misappropriation of funds. </p><p>Bankman-Fried had high ambitions. He dreamed of being the president of the United States. He thought growing FTX would be the only way to cover the billion-dollar hole on its balance sheet, but it was too late for FTX. As Warren Buffett wisely <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2001ar/2001letter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a>, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”</p><p>In the end, Bankman-Fried was caught not for crypto fraud but for traditional fraud. Theoretically, regulatory guardrails could have prevented him from commingling and embezzling funds, but the law won’t prevent someone who believes they’re uncatchable from doing wrong. </p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This metric considers the value of every contract in play for the remaining calendar months, where buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts) are continually matched.</p><h2>Bullish momentum on CME Bitcoin futures, but cautious BTC options markets</h2><p>The number of active large holders surged to a record 122 during the week of Oct. 31, signaling a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Notably, the Bitcoin CME futures premium reached its highest level in over two years.</p><p>In neutral markets, the annualized premium typically falls within the 5% to 10% range. However, the latest 15% premium for CME Bitcoin futures stands out, indicating a strong demand for long positions. This also raises concerns as some may be relying on the approval of a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/invesco-galaxy-spot-bitcoin-etf-added-to-dtcc-website\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/invesco-galaxy-spot-bitcoin-etf-added-to-dtcc-website/amp\">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded futures (ETF)</a>.</p><p>Contradicting the bullish sentiment from CME futures, evidence from Bitcoin options markets reveals a growing demand for protective put options. For instance, the put-to-call open interest ratio at the Deribit exchange reached its highest levels in over six months.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/350993a7-5ae0-442c-a03e-4c030776c068.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Deribit Bitcoin options put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas.ch</em></figcaption></figure><p>The current 1.0 level signifies a balanced open interest between call (buy) and put (sell) options. However, this indicator requires further analysis, as investors could have sold the call option, gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price.</p><p>Regardless of demand in the derivatives market, Bitcoin's price ultimately relies on spot exchange flows. For instance, the rejection at $36,000 on Nov. 2 led to a 5% correction, bringing the price down to $34,130. Interestingly, the Bitfinex exchange experienced daily net BTC inflows of $300 million during this movement.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The fourth biggest inflow of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitfinex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bitfinex</a> yesterday, was roughly $300M; as soon as the inflow started, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> started to trend down. <br><br>Extremely bullish, significant sell pressure, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> is still above $34,000<a href=\"https://t.co/xVpZcXGAZW\">https://t.co/xVpZcXGAZW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/I72N686HfH\">pic.twitter.com/I72N686HfH</a></p>— James V.

However, the downturn did not breach the $34,000 support, indicating real buyers at that level.</p><p>Bitcoin's latest correction occurred while the Russell 2000 Index futures, measuring mid-cap companies in the U.S., gained 2.5% and reached a two-week high. This suggests that Bitcoin's movement was unrelated to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at 5.25%.</p><p>Additionally, the price of gold remained stable at around $1,985 between Nov. 1 and Nov. 3, demonstrating that the world's largest store of value was not affected by the monetary policy announcement. The question remains: how much selling pressure do Bitcoin sellers at $36,000 still hold?</p><h2>Reduced Bitcoin availability on exchanges can be deceiving</h2><p>As demonstrated by the $300 million daily net inflow to Bitfinex, merely assessing current deposits at exchanges does not provide a clear picture of short-term sale availability. A lower number of deposited coins may reflect lower investor confidence in exchanges.</p><p>Apart from legal challenges against Coinbase and Binance exchanges by the U.S. SEC for unlicensed brokerage operations, the FTX-Alameda Research debacle has stirred more concerns among investors.

[Elon Musk is] not an AI scientist. He owns a small AI company. He has many other companies. His expertise is more in space and cars.”</blockquote><p>Suleyman isn’t the first AI expert or CEO to question Musk’s grasp on AI at the scientific level. In 2022, Gary Marcus, a New York University computer science professor and best-selling author, and Vivek Wadha, a distinguished fellow at both Carnegie Mellon and Harvard, challenged Musk’s assertion that artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be realized by 2029.</p><p>The two experts <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/06/03/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-agi-tesla-500k-bet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">offered</a> Musk a wager in the amount of $500,000, which would pay off if AGI was realized before the 2029 deadline. As far as Cointelegraph can tell, Musk has yet to acknowledge or respond to the proposed wager.</p><p>AGI is a nebulous concept with no agreed-upon benchmarks or measurement standards for achieving. The basic premise of the idea is that one day, due to currently unknowable technological follow-on effects, AI technology will become capable of performing any task requiring intelligence. </p><p>While some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">believe</a> that AGI, or at least sentient AI, may already exist, others in the field <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ai-isnt-close-to-becoming-sentient-the-real-danger-lies-in-how-easily-were-prone-to-anthropomorphize-it-200525\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assert</a> that current systems aren’t as intelligent or capable as humans or other animals due to their reliance on training, programming, procedures and guardrails.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

Michael Saylor is aiming for $1 million. Is it a good time to start buying?</p>\n                    <p><p>More tradition than coincidence, the Christmas season is around the corner again and the market is looking good for yet another run. Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) surged to more than $35,000 in October, another record high for 2023. The year-long rally has been attributed to unconventional market trends, including excitement over the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-sec-deadline\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-sec-deadline/amp\">Bitcoin spot ETF applications</a> pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>If, like me, you've been in the crypto space since 2014, you'd agree that the holiday season comes with a euphoric feeling — especially this year. Everyone seems to agree that a bull run is just around the corner, so it’s time to keep a watchful eye on the market and explore unique opportunities in more than one niche — and to contemplate your approach to trading.</p><h3>A conventional Christmas rally?</h3><p>Christmas rallies bring excitement and joy to many in the crypto scene. Historically, the season brings an uptick in trade volumes, significant market movements, and price surges. However, recent years have defied convention, with market dynamics influenced by unprecedented factors. Take the global pandemic in 2020, for example, along with Elon Musk's tweets in 2021 and 2022. Cryptocurrencies have soared for reasons no one could predict.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-beyond-35k-christmas-thank-jerome-powell\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-beyond-35k-christmas-thank-jerome-powell/amp\"><strong><em>Bitcoin beyond 35K for Christmas? Thank Jerome Powell if it happens</em></strong></a></p><p>Predicting crypto market behavior is akin to forecasting the weather. It's a challenging endeavor. While past years have brought December delights, this season is influenced by far more complex factors, including regulatory developments and geopolitical tensions.</p><h3>Never mind ETFs — Bitcoin’s halving lies ahead</h3><p>Investors have been positioning themselves in anticipation of a greenlight from the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF. The theory here is that an ETF will bring in institutional investors to crypto. </p><p>There is also the euphoria that Bitcoin's upcoming halving event has brought to the market. The Bitcoin halving event — scheduled to occur in April 2024 — is significant. It’s tied to Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins. The apex cryptocurrency is issued primarily through mining. Bitcoin's halving refers to the mechanism by which the number of new Bitcoin created in each block is reduced by 50%. It occurs every 210,000 blocks (or roughly every four years). The halving ensures Bitcoin remains a scarce and highly sought-after asset.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BITCOIN to $100k.

Max Keiser is forecasting a new all-time high of $220,000. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor is — as always — extremely bullish, envisioning a price of $1 million. The predictions are based on both historical trends and social influences. These and other unconventional forces were behind the rally we witnessed in October.</p><p>In my opinion, Bitcoin could comfortably break its all-time high of $69,000, and possibly surpass $169,000. </p><h3>What happens if an ETF isn’t approved?</h3><p>Analysts at financial services firm JPMorgan have suggested that if the SEC rejects the ETF applications before it, it could lead to legal action by the applicants. A <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit/amp\">court already ruled in Grayscale’s favor</a> against the SEC in August, paving the way for Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF. BlackRock, Cathie Wood‘s ARK Invest, and other firms are also in the race to win ETF approvals.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I'm sure it will be much more boring than this -- but sometimes it does feel like this is all a setup for a giant Gensler semi-comedic rug-pull.</p>— Dave Nadig (@DaveNadig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveNadig/status/1719104845322264728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs could be approved within months. At least for now, it seems inevitable, if not imminent.</p><h3>Conflict in the Middle East</h3><p>Geopolitical tensions and outright wars are a wildcard in the world of cryptocurrencies. The ongoing Middle East conflict between Israel and Hamas is a stark reminder of how external factors can ripple into the market. While the immediate implications may not be clear, historically, investors seek refuge in alternative assets —including cryptocurrencies— during global crises. So far, the war hasn't affected the crypto market, but as the situation unfolds, the market could see shifts in sentiment and capital flow.</p><p>Three days after the breakout of the war, crypto prices fell and the price of oil surged after being affected by traders speculating that the war may disrupt supplies if it spread to neighboring nations like Iran. The world's busiest shipping routes like the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Suez Canal have their home in the Middle East. This further heightens fear of an economic peril if the situation escalates to these places.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-evolving-multi-asset-network\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-evolving-multi-asset-network/amp\"><strong><em>Bitcoin is evolving into a multiasset network</em></strong></a></p><p>An expansion of the war into the Sinai Peninsula and Suez region ”increases the risks of an attack on energy and non-energy trade flowing through the Suez Canal,” the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Pat Thaker <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/israel-hamas-war-economists-fear-disruption-if-conflict-not-contained.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noted</a> in a comment to CNBC, “and that accounts for almost 15% of global trade, almost 45% of crude oil, 9% of refined, and also 8% of LNG tankers transit through that route.\"</p><p>There has been no significant effect on the crypto market so far, but if the conflict keeps escalating, it could result in heightened price sensitivity as we enter the Christmas season. </p><h3>Altcoin season?</h3><p>Traders eagerly ponder the possibility of an “altcoin” season happening as festive seasons approach. Based on historical data (where we've seen previous alt-seasons happen in December 2017 and January 2021), we might see this run start more seriously in December. I am banking on the next alt-season to run from December (aided by Bitcoin ETF approvals) and to last until Bitcoin’s halving in April.</p><p>It’s possible Bitcoin will stall at a relatively consistent level until an ETF is approved — which means it may not be a bad time to start looking at altcoins. I am particularly keen on niche sectors including GameFi and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/tokenized-real-world-assets-rwa-in-defi\">tokenized real-world assets (RWA</a>). (Obligatory disclaimer: I have been wrong in the past, and I might be wrong again.) When altcoin season does begin, tokens with valuable use cases in these areas could be at the forefront of this run.</p><p>This Christmas season holds the promise of a crypto bull run, but the path remains uncertain. The ETF debacle, global tensions, and the potential for altcoins all demand watchful vigilance. We can't always predict the future, but we can prepare for it by staying informed, managing risk, and seizing strategic opportunities. It's not just about celebrating the holidays — it's about embracing the future of finance in the ever-exciting crypto world.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Evan Luthra</strong> is a 28-year-old cryptocurrency entrepreneur who sold his first company, StudySocial, for $1.7 million at 17 and had developed over 30 mobile apps before he was 18.

A prominent takeaway was the adoption of Solana-based tools and services, innovating payments and loyalty programs.</p><p>Boba Guys, a growing United States-based bubble tea brand in the mold of Starbucks, unpacked how its pilot program for a new customer loyalty app delivered insightful data while seemingly incentivizing customers to return to its stores in San Francisco.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/visa-taps-into-solana-to-widen-usdc-payment-capability\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/visa-taps-into-solana-to-widen-usdc-payment-capability/amp\">Visa taps into Solana to widen USDC payment capability</a></em></strong></p><p>The five-week program relied solely on in-store promotion to customers in the area. Six hundred users were onboarded, with 31% of orders being attributed to the loyalty program after the fact. Co-founders Bin Chen and Andrew Chau also reported that the app saw a 67% increase in monthly visits of loyalty program users and a 65% increase in spending.</p><p>Solana Foundation’s head of commerce business development, Josh Fried, tells Cointelegraph that the development of the loyalty program provides a tangible use case for commercial clients looking for Web3, blockchain-based tools to build their businesses and customer base.</p><p>“The Boba Guys pilot initial data shows that we’re actually improving their business results. A real retailer with 25 locations got on stage and said this Solana-based program was bringing a return of investment of 800%,” Fried explained.</p><p>For every $1 that Boba Guys puts into the program, the company sees $9 in revenue in return. It’s a “legitimate business uplift,” Fried said, and the company is planning to roll out the app across its stores in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>The recent <a href=\"https://solana.com/news/solana-pay-shopify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">integration </a>of Solana Pay into e-commerce platform Shopify is another indicator that Web3-based payment tools are becoming a viable alternative for conventional businesses. Fried unpacked how merchants are beginning to provide meaningful feedback on adopting its payments rail.</p><p>The MadLab nonfungible token project noted a material uplift in sales from crypto native users who were holding crypto. “These users were holding USDC on Solana, waiting for the utility to use it to pay for something rather than just trading. The community used the integration to start buying merch,” Fried said.</p><p>Another anecdote came from an entrepreneur based in Denver, Colorado, who has turned to Shopify’s Solana Pay integration to drive sales of bespoke fragrances. The attraction to the payment solution is the ability of Web3 to help drive e-commerce sales:</p><blockquote>“When you’re buying e-commerce, you can’t smell something. Right. He’s like, ‘for a storyteller, I need metaverses, I need Web3 technology that’s going to bring new layers to the sale.’”</blockquote><p>While optimistic, Fried concedes that there is a significant amount of work to drive the adoption of Solana Pay and Web3 tools built on Solana. Having worked at Google for a decade on the development of Google Pay, he highlights that even the tech behemoth took years to see the adoption of its increasingly ubiquitous payment service.</p><p>“What helps is when somebody like Visa comes along and says, ‘Hey, we’re going to start doing interbank settlement on the Solana blockchain,‘” Fried explains. Major payment processors and rails will be crucial in driving Web3-based payment adoption. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/slumdog-billionaire-polygon-top-10-brings-no-satisfaction-sandeep-nailwal/\">Slumdog billionaire 2: ‘Top 10… brings no satisfaction’ says Polygon’s Sandeep Nailwal</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "

New technologies require new ways of operating,” White said. </p><blockquote>“With the recent downturn, we’ve actually seen companies that aren’t sustainable moving out of the Web3 space.”</blockquote><p>White says using Web3 <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/why-web2-companies-fail-in-web3-while-others-made-it\">tech shouldn’t be taken lightly</a>, and any foray into the space should be “a strategic decision” orchestrated across every operational department. </p><p>At the moment, he sees Web3 at a similar stage of development to the internet in the late 90s. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-the-dot-com-bust-can-teach-us-about-the-crypto-crash\">Speculation is rife</a>, and many companies are looking to incorporate the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/the-five-flawed-business-models-in-web3\">new tech without a plan</a>. </p><p>“The nature of innovation cycles is that during hype cycle periods, a lot of people will try the tech for a lot of purposes, and some may not actually be helped by the innovation,” White said. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/8f374217-e67c-4666-8d50-dcf5ffd90498.png\"  /></figure><p>Brendan McKittrick, founder and chairman of decentralized aviation platform Aerobloc, told Cointelegraph he thinks Web3 holds the promise of enhancing everyday products and services in areas such as supply chain transparency and data security. </p><p>The extent of this improvement depends on how effectively Web3 is implemented. McKittrick says there have been hurdles and challenges for mainstream companies using Web3, just like any new tech. </p><p>“Some mainstream businesses may adopt Web3 to ride the hype and attract investors, potentially resulting in superficial integration that fails to deliver significant benefits,” McKittrick said. </p><blockquote>“These missteps can be valuable learning experiences, helping industries refine their approach and maximize the benefits of Web3 in the long run.”</blockquote><p>In some cases, adopting the tech is out of the company’s hands, as with French gaming giant Ubisoft, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ubisoft-cools-off-on-nfts-and-blockchain-says-it-s-in-research-mode\">who had to cool on plans to use NFTs</a> and blockchain after player backlash.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ubisoft-launches-ubisoft-quartz-platform-for-playable-and-energy-efficient-nfts\"><strong><em>Ubisoft launches Ubisoft Quartz platform for playable and energy-efficient NFTs</em></strong></a></p><p>Overall, McKittrick believes Web3 isn’t just about tech; it’s a mindset that includes decentralization, trust and rethinking ownership — all of which could benefit the mainstream industry. </p><p>However, he believes that in some cases, the systems already in place might be more effective, and while Web3 holds “significant potential for a wide range of applications,” its suitability “depends on the specific needs and characteristics of each industry.” </p><p>“Its universality is tempered by the need for careful consideration of each industry’s unique requirements and constraints,” McKittrick said. </p><p>“Some sectors may not benefit as much from decentralization or blockchain technology, and traditional systems might still be more cost-effective and efficient for them,” he added. </p><h2>Some mainstream industries are successfully using Web3 already </h2><p>Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/komodo-to-introduce-12-blockchain-protocols-in-the-next-version-of-atomicdex\">blockchain platform Komodo</a>, told Cointelegraph that, in his opinion, Web3 tech is already improving products in mainstream industries such as music, gaming and real estate. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-is-transforming-the-music-industry-heres-how\"><strong><em>Web3 is transforming the music industry — Here’s how</em></strong></a></p><p>On the music scene, he says Web3 tech helps artists eliminate intermediaries, such as record labels and streaming services, allowing artists to connect with their audience directly. </p><p>“Web3-minded musicians retain control over their creative works, helping to ensure fair compensation for their efforts because decentralized music platforms provide transparent royalty systems,” Stadelmann said. </p><p>“Artists receive instant payments for their streams or downloads without delays or complex contracts with flaky independent labels or overbearing major labels.” </p><p>Web3 tech has been very active on the music scene, from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-democratize-music-industry-and-redistribute-song-rights\">democratizing song rights royalties</a> and blockchain licensing to legacy companies like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sony-music-files-trademark-application-for-nft-authenticated-music\">Sony Entertainment filing patents</a> for NFT-authenticated music. </p><p>Artists have also begun exploring new ways of driving fan engagement using wallet-based loyalty incentives and token-based communities.

Tokenization also allows properties to be divided into digital tokens representing ownership shares.</p><p>“This enables fractional ownership and opens up real estate investments to a wider range of individuals who may not have had access before,” Stadelmann said. </p><p>“Transparency and immutability in property transactions reduces fraud and increases trust among parties involved. Web3 also empowers individuals to monetize their properties through decentralized finance platforms,” he added. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/b445af81-dbb3-40c3-871b-2a7a219692d4.jpg\"  /></figure><p>Stadelmann believes the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mixing-reality-with-the-metaverse-fashion-icon-phillip-plein-goes-crypto\">fashion industry has benefited</a> from an injection of Web3 tech as well, with the ability to direct peer-to-peer interactions between designers and consumers. </p><p>He says designers can protect their intellectual property rights and receive compensation for their <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements\">creations through smart contracts</a>, authenticating products and combating counterfeiting.</p><p>“Unique digital identities can be assigned to each garment, allowing consumers to verify its authenticity with a simple scan,” Stadelmann said. </p><p>“This not only protects brands from revenue loss but also ensures consumer confidence in their purchases,” he added. </p><h2>Web3 has potential but still needs more development for mainstream </h2><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bradley Allgood, CEO and co-founder of Fintech company Fluent Finance, said he thinks Web3 tech does have the potential for use in the mainstream finance world. </p><p>However, he says the on-chain and legacy worlds need to come to a consensus on a trusted gold standard medium of exchange that can flow frictionlessly between on-chain and traditional financial ecosystems. </p><p>“Until then, it will be more of the same gimmicky adoption efforts and marketing hype,” he said. </p><p>“It’s just like every other technology based on value: it needs a sound medium of exchange and financial infrastructure in order to support commercial applications,” Allgood added. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-gaming-still-a-long-way-from-mainstream-adoption-survey\"><strong><em>Web3 gaming still a long way from mainstream adoption: Survey</em></strong></a></p><p>At the moment, Allgood says in his experience, Web3 integration processes can be clunky and inefficient and create inferior user experiences because the middleware and interoperability infrastructure isn’t there just yet.</p><p>There have been attempts to marry Web3 and blockchain in finance already.

A blockchain tries to be secure, fast and decentralized. </p>\n                    <p><p>Looking at all the cryptocurrency in tracking sites like Coinmarketcap.com may leave most beginners confused at the number of tokens being offered to the public. Layer-1, layer-2, metaverse, DeFi, gaming, liquid staking, real world assets, memes and the like are like the toys in a large toy shop. Each has its own separate world.</p> <p>One of the more recent types of tokens that have hit the market are called layer-2 scaling solutions. Examples of these tokens are Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, Consensys Linea, Coinbase Base, Starkware and a few that are not yet well known. </p> <p>Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin stated something <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma\">called</a> the Blockchain Trilemma. A blockchain tries to be secure, fast and decentralized. But according to Buterin, it is very hard to achieve all three. Ethereum, for example, is secure and decentralized, but it is quite slow. Transactions can sometimes take an hour or so to finalize if the network is congested. It is secure and decentralized because more than 500,000 independent validator nodes now secure the network and approve transactions by consensus. That is also why it is slow compared to a blockchain that only has a handful of nodes that validate transactions by consensus.</p> <p>The early blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain and others basically tried to do all the work of a blockchain by themselves. This is somewhat similar to a restaurant manager who is also the one taking orders, cooking the food, chopping the vegetables, manning the cash register, pouring the drinks and cleaning the tables and floors. The next customer would need to wait until the one-man crew is ready to take their order. Hence, a long line forms outside the restaurant.</p> <p>The new layer-2 scaling solutions basically take some of the blockchain functions and only do the final settlement on the Ethereum chain. To the user, they may not notice and might be surprised that Ethereum is still behind the scenes as the one that records the final transaction. But the front end portion of the transactions are handled by the layer-2 chains.</p> <p>Some time ago Ethereum underwent an upgrade called Shapella. This upgrade allowed the people who staked their ETH for validator nodes to withdraw these. Another upgrade that was done previously was to shift from Proof of Work (like Bitcoin) to Proof of Stake.</p> <p>The problem is that Ethereum transactions are still slow and the gas (transaction) fees are still expensive. This is actually what the layer-2 scaling solutions want to address. For example, someone who wants to buy an NFT might not want to pay $50 for transaction fees on a $200 NFT. On the other hand, the buyer might be more amenable if the transaction fee was only $5, but the transaction is done on a layer-2 scaling solution that in turn finalizes on Ethereum. </p> <p>Conversely, if you are transacting something worth a million dollars, having the security of Ethereum might be worth a $20 gas fee just for your own peace of mind.</p> <p>The way the layer-2 solutions work is sort of like dealing with the waiter and server at a restaurant, on the ordering, serving and payment. But you don’t actually see the chef who cooked your food. That’s how a layer-2 scaling solution works. It is still working on top of Ethereum, but you just see the scaling solution fee and speed.</p> <p>One problem that comes up when you have many Ethereum layer-2 tokens is that when you are using one distributed application (dApp), you need one kind of layer-2; then for another dApp, you need another layer-2. That’s somewhat similar to having non-interchangeable poker chips from one casino to another. Although, right now you can bridge in between these different assets, but everytime you do so, you pay gas fees. </p> <p>Whether this strategy of performing most functions on layer-2 over Ethereum will dominate other layer-1 monolithic, “do everything” blockchains is still anyone’s guess. But the upcoming wave of layer-2 tokens looks like they will try to do just that.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.zain-ventures.com/\">Zain Jaffer</a> is the CEO of Zain Ventures focused on investments in Web3 and real estate.</em></p> <div class=\"wp-block-columns\"> <div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\"> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> </div> </div> <p><em>This article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

Musk’s nearly hour-long chat with Sunak was one of the main events of the second day.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AI discussion with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishiSunak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RishiSunak</a> <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/f5FHGQzE4r\">pic.twitter.com/f5FHGQzE4r</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1720188083780370481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Their conversation touched on everything from AI risks to China and opened with Elon Musk likening the emerging technology to a “magic genie.”</p><blockquote>“It is somewhat of the magic genie problem, where if you have a magic genie that can grant all the wishes, usually those stories don’t end well. Be careful what you wish for.”</blockquote><p>Both mentioned these intelligent bots needing a physical “off-switch” and drew parallels to science-fiction movies like <em>The Terminator</em>. “All these movies with the same plot fundamentally all end with the person turning it off,” Sunak said. </p><p>Musk commented: </p><blockquote>“It’s both good and bad. One of the challenges in the future will be, how do we find meaning in life if you have a magic genie that can do everything you want?”</blockquote><p>This was brought up after governments and AI companies came to an agreement to put new models through official testing before their public release, which Sunak called a “landmark agreement.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nist-establishes-ai-safety-institute-consortium-response-biden-executive-order\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/nist-establishes-ai-safety-institute-consortium-response-biden-executive-order/amp\"><strong><em>NIST establishes AI Safety Institute Consortium in response to Biden executive order</em></strong></a></p><p>When asked about AI’s impact on the labor market, Musk called it the most “disruptive force in history” and said the technology will be smarter than the smartest human. </p><blockquote>“There will come a point where no job is needed. You can have a job if you want to have a job for personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything.”</blockquote><p>“I don’t know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable,” Musk concluded. </p><p>In addition, Musk commented on China’s inclusion in the summit, saying their presence was “essential.” “If they’re not participants, it’s pointless,” he said. </p><blockquote>“If the United States and the U.K. and China are aligned on safety, then that’s going to be a good thing because that’s where the leadership is generally.”</blockquote><p>Over the past year, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-official-confirms-military-concerns-over-china-access-ai-cloud-technology\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/us-official-confirms-military-concerns-over-china-access-ai-cloud-technology/amp\">the U.S. and China have gone head-to-head</a> in the race to develop and deploy the most advanced AI systems. </p><p>When Sunak asked Musk what he believes governments should be doing to mitigate risk, Musk responded:</p><p>“I generally think that it is good for the government to play a role when public safety is at risk; for the vast majority of software, public safety is not at risk. But when we talk about digital super intelligence, which does pose a risk to the public, then there is a role for the government to play to safeguard the public.”</p><p>He said while there are people in Silicon Valley who believe it will crush innovation and slow it down, Musk assured that regulations will “be annoying,” but having what he called a “referee” will be a good thing. </p><blockquote>“Government to be a referee to make sure there is sportsmanlike conduct and public safety are addressed because at times I think there is too much optimism about technology.”</blockquote><p>Since the rapid emergence of AI into the mainstream, governments worldwide have been <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-administration-executive-order-ai-safety-standards\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/biden-administration-executive-order-ai-safety-standards/amp\">rushing to find suitable solutions</a> for regulating the technology. </p><p>Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1720372289378590892?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">posted</a> on X, formerly Twitter,  on Nov. 3 that his \"xAI\"  will release its first AI to a\" select group.\" He claimed that in some \"important\" ways it could be the \"best\" currently on the market.  </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-killed-translation-industry-easytranslate-boss-change-human-jobs/\"><strong><em>‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template>\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

John Ford, deputy commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office, stated:</p><blockquote>“This collaboration between public and private specialists not only generates operational outcomes, but shares expert training, techniques and procedures, which is integral for the participants to remain proactive and effective in a rapidly evolving operating environment.”</blockquote><p>Ryan Ryder from Chainalysis pointed out that crypto’s inherent transparency, coupled with international public and private sector experts, “can collaborate to identify and shut down illicit activity,” a task that remains impossible in traditional finance.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/g7-countries-ai-code-of-conduct-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/g7-countries-ai-code-of-conduct-report/amp\"><strong><em>G7 countries to launch AI code of conduct: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/\">Cointelegraph Innovation Circle</a> recently featured seven crypto experts in an article <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/7-crypto-leaders-share-tips-to-help-web3-companies-prep-for-tax-season\">to help Web3 companies prep for tax season</a>.

Solana’s native token, SOL (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>), saw a significant drop in value in the immediate wake of FTX’s bankruptcy, with its token trading at $36 in early November 2022 before dropping as low as $12 in the days after the exchange’s collapse.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-found-guilty-on-all-charges\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-found-guilty-on-all-charges/amp\"><strong><em>Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all 7 charges in FTX fraud trial</em></strong></a></p><p>Solana’s brains trust and several investors contacted hundreds of teams building products, services and decentralized applications to take stock of the collateral damage.

Those teams saw their runway evaporate.”</blockquote><p>Yakovenko empathized with founders who had toiled to raise capital and placed their trust in FTX as the custodian of those funds. “You keep it in an exchange that everyone seemed to trust, and boom, it’s gone. It was a catastrophic failure for those companies,” he added.</p><p>A prime example was Armani Ferrante, who had raised some $20 million to build out Solana-based cryptocurrency infrastructure firm Coral. The engineer has previously estimated that his company lost around $14.5 million it had held on FTX.</p><blockquote>“Folks like Armani just really doubled down and rebuilt their companies. They took that failure and channeled it as energy to build.”</blockquote><p>While Yakovenko concedes that seeing SOL’s value <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/not-just-ftx-token-solana-price-nukes-40-along-with-other-sam-coins\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/not-just-ftx-token-solana-price-nukes-40-along-with-other-sam-coins/amp\">plummet due to the exposure</a> that some prominent Solana projects had from several Sam Bankman-Fried-led investments was a tough pill to swallow, it paled in comparison to the damage done to ecosystem projects.</p><p>“It was gut-wrenching. The token price dropping sucked, but that’s crypto. It moves up and down all the time. But people’s runways getting evaporated — that really hurt. I’m just glad the vast majority of teams survived,” the CEO added.</p><p>The dust is beginning to settle as the one-year anniversary of the collapse of FTX approaches.

That’s about a billion dollars per month worth of selling into the market. The protocol forces that to be cut in half as of next April, or late April.”</blockquote><p>Considering the impact of the halving on selling and demand, Saylor said:</p><blockquote>“So you’re going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted to $6 billion of natural selling a year. At the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin. So that’s why all of us are fairly bullish over the next 12 months. Demand is going to increase, and supply is going to contract and this is fairly unprecedented in the history of Wall Street.” </blockquote><h2>Now is a “pretty ideal entry point” for Bitcoin</h2><p>To date, Bitcoin price has gained 114%, 30% of which was added in the last month. Despite these gains, the price remains nearly 50% down from its all-time high, and the average person is likely to have memories of the FTX implosion and other crypto scandals in their mind before considering BTC’s performance in 2023. </p><p>When asked whether he believed the well of institutional investor interest had been poisoned by “bad and dark applications of this cryptocurrency and people like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-lied-customers-trust-prosecution-makes-closing-argument-against-sbf\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-lied-customers-trust-prosecution-makes-closing-argument-against-sbf/amp\">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, Saylor said, </p><blockquote>“I think that the liabilities or the early crypto cowboys, the crypto tokens which are unregistered securities, the unreliable crypto custodians, for the industry to move to the next level, we’re going to need to migrate to adult supervision.” </blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-dips-overheated-bitcoin-derivatives-angst\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-dips-overheated-bitcoin-derivatives-angst/amp\"><strong><em>BTC price dips 3.5% as 'overheated' Bitcoin derivatives spark angst</em></strong></a></p><p>Regarding the current investing climate, Saylor suggested that “If you’ve got a 12-month to 48-month time horizon, this is a pretty ideal entry point into the asset.”</p><blockquote>“When banks on Wall Street and responsible custodians are managing Bitcoin and the industry takes its eyes away from all the shiny little tokens that have distracted and demolished shareholder value, I think the industry moves to the next level and we 10x from here.” </blockquote><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/regulatory-approval-to-offer-xrp-services/",
    "description": "Ripple grabs yet another achievement with its recent legal and regulatory approval which will basically grant crypto-related firms within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) the right to offer XRP services. Latest Approval Sparks Broader XRP Adoption According to a recent announcement, XRP was recently approved under the digital asset regime of the Dubai independent financial services regulatory body within the DIFC, Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Related Reading: Dubai Watchdog Sounds The Alarm On Crypto Regulatory Blind Spots This achievement appears to be more significant than it seems. This is due to the position held by the DIFC as the top financial center not only in Dubai or the UAE, but also covering a huge territory, including the whole Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region. Additionally, for the past 20 years and counting, the DIFC has been the hub for a variety of financial initiatives, which makes it one of the major locations for companies, investors, and financial institutions in the MEASA area. With this approval, regulated cryptocurrency-focused businesses based in the MEASA region would be able to provide all kinds of cryptocurrency-related services using XRP. These include lending, and trading, among others.  Trade and investment within the MEASA region have benefited abundantly from the DIFC&#8217;s assistance. This is because it is crucial for connecting MEASA companies and investors with the rest of the globe.  Due to this, the financial hub&#8217;s legislative lucidity on XRP creates several opportunities for the crypto asset throughout the 72 MEASA member nations. This is a significant achievement because despite XRP already enjoying regulatory clarity in several MEASA nations with pro-crypto laws, it may buttress its notoriety in the area.  Thereby introducing the digital asset to a major number of MEASA firms whose headstations are located there. Another reason why the approval is impressive is because a lot of major players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are from the MEASA region. These include crucial nations like the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and India.  As part of the DIFC&#8217;s crypto asset regime, XRP has become the first cryptocurrency that the regulatory body authorized legally and regulatoryly through an external application. The digital asset is now the latest addition to other digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) in the region. However, these other assets were not approved through an external application. India The Leading Player In Cryptocurrency Adoption India being in the MEASA region sparks a wider adoption of XRP as the country has been the top major player in cryptocurrency adoption since 2023.  According to an excerpt that was released in September by the New York-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, it was revealed that India was leading the charge in terms of grassroots cryptocurrency adoption. In addition, several other countries leading the grassroots crypto adoption appeared to be from the MEASA region, such as Vietnam, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

    "description": "The crypto industry saw a spectacular run in October, as a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana registered new yearly highs. However, the entire market seems to be taking a breather after this action-packed October that saw Bitcoin, XRP, and Shiba Inu lead impressive rallies.  On-chain data, particularly from the crypto analytics platform Santiment, showed October ended on a somehow bearish note. But history from this particular metric suggests that the rally might not be over.  XRP And Shiba Inu Rally Not Over The first few days of November appear to be devoid of significant crypto price movement, with the exception of occasional whale transfers. At the time of writing, XRP and SHIB are down by 1% and 2%, respectively, in a 24-hour timeframe. Bitcoin and Ethereum are also down by 2.51% and 1.93% respectively. Some crypto experts attribute this decline to traders taking profit, while others think the crypto market has returned to its normalcy of bearish sentiment. Related Reading: ProShares Goes Short On Ethereum With New ETF Launch Popular crypto analytics platform Santiment predicted this sentiment a few days ago. According to Santiment, the Bullish Vs Bearish Sentiment Keyword turned towards a bearish ratio at the end of October. The metric, which tracks various keyword mentions like &#8220;buy,&#8221; &#8220;sell,&#8221; &#8220;buying,&#8221; &#8220;selling,&#8221; &#8220;topped,&#8221; and &#8220;bottom&#8221; on social media, spent the bulk of October on the bullish end of its range. The firm quickly pointed out that previous instances of higher ratios of bearish keywords had preceded gains in the market caps of popular cryptocurrencies. Aside from Bitcoin, on-chain metrics and fundamental analysis point to a continued rally for XRP and SHIB. These two cryptocurrencies, in particular, have dominated social mentions in the past few months, according to this indicator. 😒 After the trading crowd stayed pretty neutral over the weekend, @santimentfeed data indicates that current sentiment has turned #bearish once again. In the previous instances of higher ratios of negative keywords, #Bitcoin &#38; other market caps rose. 📈https://t.co/2p2uVitBkX pic.twitter.com/0vn3HGC7Gr — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 31, 2023 Altcoins Still Poised For Growth On the fundamental side, XRP has done extremely well, especially as trading resumed on various crypto exchanges. XRP is up by 32% since the beginning of the year, and various analysts have pointed to another price surge.  A look into XRP&#8217;s price action shows a series of higher low formations since October 30, indicating waning pressure from the bears. XRP is now trading at $0.6036, and the bulls could make another attempt to break over the latest higher high of $0.62 if the price stays above $0.60. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Rally Threatened As Exchange Drops BCH Following XRP Listing Rumors SHIB has also had a similar path, with updates to its ecosystem like Shibarium contributing to various price surges. SHIB&#8217;s price momentum has slowed down at the time of writing, but planned updates to the Shina Inu ecosystem could lead to another price rally soon.  At the same time, on-chain signals point to more bullish than bearish. SHIB whales have resumed large transfers to private wallets, as shown by data from Whale Alerts. SHIB is trading at $0.000007788 at the time of writing. Despite the entire market cap being down by 2.24% in the past day, data from Coinmarketcap points to greed on the Fear &#38; Greed Index.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/can-dogecoin-rally-135-what-needs-to-happen/",
    "description": "In a recent analysis, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has pinpointed the signs of a potential breakout in the Dogecoin (DOGE) price, which could pave the way for a significant price rally. However, several factors must come together for this scenario to unfold. Dogecoin Price Ready For A Breakout? Rekt Capital has shared the following 1-week DOGE/USD chart. According to his analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s price movement has been confined within a descending channel pattern since its peak at the end of last year. This pattern is characterized by two parallel trendlines, representing potential support and resistance levels, with the Dogecoin’s price oscillating between them. Last Wednesday, DOGE&#8217;s price was rejected once again at the upper trendline, making it the fifth rejection within the last year. However, a key observation made by Rekt Capital is the &#8220;buy-the-dip&#8221; behavior exhibited by traders, which has so far prevented a strong downside continuation. He highlights: That &#8220;buy-the-dip&#8221; behavior we saw yesterday is looking like relief under key resistance. However, there has been no strong DOGE rejection &#38; downside continuation. Most important signal is a Weekly Close above Channel Top to confirm a breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Deep Pullback After Failing To Hold Key Resistance, Analyst As Rekt Capital emphasizes, the most crucial signal for a potential breakout is if Dogecoin can achieve a weekly close above the channel&#8217;s top. Therefore, DOGE bulls need to display a strong &#8220;buy-the-dip&#8221; behavior. Should the price successfully close above the channel top, it could signify a strong bullish trend in the offing. Potential Price Targets Turning to the daily chart of DOGE/USD, several key price targets can be deduced based on Fibonacci retracement levels and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The EMAs, which are utilized to pinpoint potential support and resistance levels based on past price data, are showing a cluster around the $0.0660 to $0.0684 range. Currently, DOGE has dropped below the crucial 200-day EMA (blue line) at $0.0684, but found support at 20-day EMA (red line) at $0.0660. If a breakout from the descending trend channel is successful, the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.0785 will probably be the first major price target. If DOGE bounces off this level, a retest of the breakout is very likely &#8211; it would be a do-or-die moment for Dogecoin. However, a successful retest could pave the way for DOGE to break above the $0.0785 price level and set the stage for the subsequent price targets. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Big Leap? ‘Promising’ Indicators To Watch On the higher side, the Fibonacci retracement levels to watch are 0.382 ($0.0938), 0.5 ($0.1062), 0.618 ($0.1186) and 0.786 ($0.1363), which often act as critical resistance and support zones. The ultimate goal of a potential 135% rally would be the November 1 high at $0.1588. In conclusion, while the current market sentiments and patterns hint at a potential breakout, it remains imperative for DOGE to secure a weekly close above the channel top. Should this happen, and coupled with supportive market dynamics, Dogecoin could witness a breathtaking rally once again. Featured image from Kanchanara / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

    "description": "In the financial center of Dubai, the Cardano Summit 2023 will gather some of the most prominent projects in the crypto space. During the three-day event, speakers, founders, and the community will voice views on the growing sector and the future of the network and blockchain technology as Cardano enters a critical stage in its development. 🎉 Kicking off the Networking Soirée in Dubai! #CardanoSummit2023 pic.twitter.com/6KwkVHSlZo — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) November 2, 2023  What’s Missing In The Cardano Ecosystem? The Cardano Summit 2023 began with a networking soirée leading to the &#8216;Battle of the Builders&#8217; competition. The event, sponsored by industry leaders like CV Labs and Genius X, featured ten projects in a pitch contest showcasing the versatility of the Cardano ecosystem. Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, highlighted the robust number of Cardano GitHub repositories as evidence of the platform&#8217;s readiness for innovation. The number of developers working and shipping products on this blockchain has increased following its implementation of smart contract capabilities. After intense deliberation by a panel of seasoned judges, including Gregaard and representatives from EMURGO and STORM Partners, Maestro claimed the top spot, with NEWM and zkFold rounding out the winner&#8217;s circle. The summit continues with more workshops and sessions. Speaking with our team, Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner at STORM Partners, gave his perspective on the event, the obstacles of the building during a bear market, the topics dominating the Summit, the key component missing in the ecosystem, and the distinct quality of the Cardano community: passion. STORM has been a long-time partner of Cardano and its ecosystem, aiding them in projects like Ergo Media, marketing, and educational efforts. Ahmed told us: So there are three main topics of the conference. Operational, resilience, education and adoption. Those are the three ones that things are centered towards today&#8217;s on the innovation stage. The last discussions are around stablecoins and the importance of stablecoins within the Carano ecosystem. I think a lot of the Cardano community and projects are feeling the pressure of not having a Cardano interoperable (stablecoin). And you can really see that it&#8217;s impeding the ability to create DeFi products and applications. Ahmed was one of the judges during the startup competition and saw how the community and the Cardano Foundation leadership leaned towards those projects building stablecoin solutions. In 2024, Ahmed expects Cardano to launch its native stablecoin, which could have major implications for this ecosystem, similar to the “Alonzo” Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event: So that thing is something (a native stablecoin) that&#8217;s just a missing piece of the puzzle that just needs to be filled in the Cardano ecosystem, and that it will be within the next, I&#8217;d say by mid next year, it should be the case from what I saw about some of the announcements, some of the discussions, etcetera. So that was the first one. Then education was a big topic this morning because there&#8217;s quite a wide community in Cardano. Cardano has quite a widespread community on a variety of different things. I think one topic that wasn&#8217;t approached today that was kind of on the tongues of a lot of people in the audience was like, well, “all these things are good, but if we don&#8217;t have the funding or the money to do so, how is that going to work out?” And you probably know that the funding of Cardano happens through Catalyst, which is their funding mechanism. And they&#8217;ve done 10 funding rounds so far and so the mood at the conference was not bad in terms of the funding round 10, which was I think $5 million just closed a few weeks ago or a month ago. So people are kind of happy or in good sentiment because those that got the approval have money to start building, doing things, etcetera. Because it&#8217;d been a year since they hadn&#8217;t had a funding round, and that was quite a long time. Normally, the cycles have been at maximum of four to six months. Ultimately, Ahmed believes the Summit marks a major milestone for the Cardano ecosystem as it moves into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Cardano Summit 2023: Founder Hoskinson Speaks Today, the founder of Cardano and CEO at Input Output Global (IOG), Charles Hoskinson, took the main stage to speak about the blockchain’s “Past, Present, and Future.” Using his famous whiteboards, Hoskinson presented the “strategic pillars” underpinning Cardano&#8217;s evolution: Scaling, Governance, and Interoperability. Whiteboard session with @IOHK_Charles about #Cardano: Past, Present and Future 🖖#CardanoSummit2023 pic.twitter.com/VXLOaLbc7i — Romain Pellerin (@rom1_pellerin) November 3, 2023  In addition, Hoskinson outlined upcoming enhancements like Hydra for scaling and governance tools like 1694 and Intersect, emphasizing the network&#8217;s direction towards self-amendment capabilities. For interoperability, the Cardano founder cited advances with sidechains and the implementation of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs). Hoskinson introduced the Cardano Settlement Layer (CASL) as a mainnet foundation for service layers, alongside PartnerChains for service layer collaboration, leveraging Minotaur&#8217;s consensus algorithm for cross-consensus interoperability. The framework will utilize Parity Substrate with Babel fees, enabling native asset transactions. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview"

    "description": "Swiss non-profit Aragon Association has announced its dissolution, offering users the opportunity to redeem its native token, ANT, for ETH (Ethereum). This strategic move marks a crucial shift in the organization&#8217;s path and aims to address challenges that have arisen in recent times. As part of this dissolution process, ANT token holders will have a one-year window to redeem their tokens. The association will deploy a total of 86,343 Ether into a redemption contract, offering a redemption rate of 0.0025376 Ether per ANT, according to a statement released on Thursday. This initiative is designed to provide a fair and efficient way for ANT holders to transition from their existing tokens into Ethereum.

These funds will be earmarked to cover any outstanding costs related to the dissolution and to serve as a safeguard against unforeseen regulatory challenges. In the event that unused funds remain after the dissolution, they will be directed towards a &#8220;product-focused structure,&#8221; signifying the association&#8217;s commitment to continuing its mission. We have an important update for all stakeholders of the @AragonProject.

The organization attempted to rescue itself through a hurried endeavor to place control of the treasury directly in the hands of ANT holders. However, the association encountered a significant discrepancy between the value of the treasury and the token market cap, preventing the success of this approach. Faced with these complexities, the association made the difficult choice to return funds to investors and formally dissolve.

It has developed aragonOS, a set of developer tools that empower users to create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) seamlessly. Furthermore, the Aragon App, a product of the association, allows developers to create DAOs without the need for extensive coding expertise. Token Redemption Timeline Users who hold ANT tokens will have until November 2, 2024, to take advantage of the redemption program. Following the completion of the redemption process, all ANT tokens will be permanently removed from circulation. As the association emphasized, there will be no further purpose in holding ANT tokens beyond this point. The Aragon Association&#8217;s decision to dissolve itself and provide a redemption program for ANT token holders reflects its commitment to addressing challenges and maintaining the project&#8217;s integrity. This strategic move ensures a transparent and fair transition for users, while preserving the organization&#8217;s mission to foster innovation in the blockchain space.

    "description": "A pro-XRP lawyer known for advocating for the cryptocurrency has outlined reasons why he believes Ripple would not abandon the XRP token.  Lawyer Proclaims That Ripple Is Committed To XRP Pro-XRP lawyer and Managing Partner of the Deaton Firm, John E. Deaton has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to assuage concerns raised about Ripple’s commitment and plans for the XRP token.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Rally Threatened As Exchange Drops BCH Following XRP Listing Rumors Following the recent announcement of XRP’s expansion into Dubai after gaining approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), Deaton boldly stated in his post that Ripple was not planning to ditch the XRP token and would not be for years. He said that the crypto payments network had a strong financial responsibility to the token, having invested billions in XRP.  “As I’ve said for more than 3 years, Ripple is not going to abandon XRP. It has a fiduciary duty not to,” Deaton stated.  Deaton highlighted Ripple’s financial journey revolving around the XRP token. He stated that in its Series A funding in 2015, Ripple was valued at $128 million. In Series B, the crypto payments network’s value rose again in the following year to $410 million and by 2020, Ripple had attained a value of $10 billion in its Series C valuation.  Deaton also mentioned Ripple’s Series C buyback valuation last year, which saw the crypto network purchasing its Series C shares at a 50% higher price.  According to Deaton, Ripple’s growing value and large-scale investments regarding XRP are proof enough that the crypto network would continue its support for XRP. The pro-XRP lawyer disclosed that Ripple owned $48 billion to $50 billion worth of XRP, which makes it inconceivable for the crypto network to abandon XRP. He also stated that Ripple has more to gain than lose, especially if the XRP token price surges to $2.  “Ripple’s pre-IPO shares clearly trade at a valuation significantly less than $15B. Owning 48B-50B XRP makes it insane to abandon XRP. If #XRP reaches $2, Ripple has an asset valued at $100B,” Deaton stated.  Token price holds $0.6 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Enthusiast Question Price Standstill After Major Milestones While many XRP community members have commemorated the recent successes in the XRP ecosystem, an XRP enthusiast has chosen to voice out concerns about the lingering question of why the price of XRP has not been affected by its new achievements.  XRP Cryptowolf took to X on Thursday to publish XRP’s newest development of partnering with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) and why the token has not shown any significant price surges following the announcement.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are Moving SHIB Again, Bearish Or Bullish? “Anyone else wondering why $XRP didn’t skyrocket to the news of Ripple partnering with a central bank?” XRP Cryptowolf stated.  Additionally, following John Deaton’s statement that Ripple would not abandon the XRP token, an XRP community member disclosed that the XRP token had shown only a slight price change when a larger surge was expected. “And yet here we are up 3 pennies haha any other coin would have jumped $15 bucks in a day with this kind of news,” an XRP community member stated. While the present price of XRP has displayed a slower price growth than its past, many crypto enthusiasts believe that the cryptocurrency’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been the primary source of its growth stunt.  In response to XRP Cryptowolf’s question about the slack in the price of XRP, a community member stated that “for XRP to truly be free and demonstrate its potential, it will only happen after it clears all the SEC lawsuits.” Featured image from StormGain, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-rally-not-etf-driven-qcp/",
    "description": "In their latest market update, QCP Capital, a crypto asset trading firm headquartered in Singapore, has dissected the recent Bitcoin price movements, attributing the rally to macroeconomic factors rather than the much-anticipated approval of a spot ETF. To recall, the Bitcoin surged from $34,500 to almost $36,000 on Wednesday. The Main Reason For The Bitcoin Price Rally The firm&#8217;s technical analysis highlighted that Bitcoin reached the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $35,912 and touched the upper channel trendline before retreating, a move that was keenly observed by market participants. QCP Capital&#8217;s report states, &#8220;This latest rally, however, was less about spot ETF developments and more about macro forces.&#8221; These macro forces were identified following a dovish stance from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and a smaller than expected Treasury Q1 supply estimate, which led to a significant drop in bond yields. This, in turn, has had a bullish effect on risk assets, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flag On Bitcoin Rally, Predicts Imminent Retreat After 35% Spike However, the firm also had a word of caution, saying, “Whether this marks the start of a new global equity and bond uptrend remains to be seen, as the macro picture essentially remains unchanged, outside a correction of overly bearish bond sentiment.” The firm also noted the Bitcoin derivatives market, where &#8220;perp funding, and term forwards, implied volatility and risk reversals across the curve continue to remain or extend further at extreme elevated levels.&#8221; This suggests a market bracing for a significant move, with derivative traders positioned for a potential upside breakout that hinges on the approval of a spot ETF. Looking at the broader financial landscape, the bond market has been experiencing notable fluctuations. Recently, the 30-year Treasury yield has reached another 16-year high, climbing above 5%. This level of yield has not been seen since 2007, and it represents a rise of over 4 percentage points in just three years. Such movements in the bond market are critical for the Bitcoin and crypto market as they affect the risk sentiment among investors.

Combined with geopolitical tensions + war, the need for QE in the future is increasing rapidly. This is causing insurance assets (Gold, Bitcoin) to absolutely rip in unison,” Carpriole Investment’s Charles Edwards remarked recently. In summary, QCP Capital&#8217;s insights into Bitcoin market dynamics versus current bond market trends suggest that while the Bitcoin market is influenced by a variety of factors, including speculation about exchange-traded fund approval, macroeconomic indicators such as bond yields play a larger role in determining market sentiment and price action than other pundits believe. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $34,235 and at risk of breaking out of the established uptrend channel to the downside. If that happens, low price levels could come next.

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing a notable surge in its value, effectively propelling the entire cryptocurrency market upwards. The recent upswing has drawn the attention of various experts in the field, one of whom is the pseudonymous crypto strategist known as TechDev.  In a recent post on the popular social media platform X, TechDev emphasized that Bitcoin, often referred to as the king of cryptocurrencies, is poised to enter an &#8220;explosive&#8221; phase, citing the reversal of the king crypto&#8217;s long-term metrics as evidence.  According to TechDev, a specific signal occurs approximately every 3 to 3.5 years, indicating an impending period of several months during which the market capitalization of Bitcoin is expected to grow significantly. Every 3 to 3.5 years, this signal says the next several months will be explosive for #Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/OQkoCVgbwH — TechDev (@TechDev_52) October 28, 2023 Related Reading: Solana Bulls Are Charging – Could $50 Be Just Around The Corner? Analyzing TechDev&#8217;s Bitcoin Insights Analyzing the intricate dynamics at play, TechDev&#8217;s chart highlights an intriguing correlation between China&#8217;s 10-year yield on its bond and the US dollar index, suggesting that as China&#8217;s bond yield decreases in relation to the US Dollar Index, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is predicted to rise.  10 degree $BTC/#NASDAQ breakouts are not ones to miss. pic.twitter.com/NmW7n5kiKe — TechDev (@TechDev_52) November 1, 2023 Simplifying this, it implies that as the yield on China&#8217;s long-term bonds decreases in comparison to the strength of the US dollar, there is an increased likelihood of Bitcoin&#8217;s value escalating, possibly due to shifting investor sentiment and a growing appetite for alternative assets. Furthermore, TechDev underlines Bitcoin&#8217;s historical breakouts against the NASDAQ over the years, emphasizing the significance of these breakthrough moments. These instances serve as a strong indication for investors, signaling the importance of not overlooking Bitcoin&#8217;s potential to break out significantly against the renowned stock exchange.  Bitcoin currently trading at $34,610 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Cathie Wood&#8217;s Vote Of Confidence In addition to the optimistic sentiments surrounding Bitcoin, prominent financial figure Cathie Wood, the head of Ark Investment, has expressed unwavering confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against the potential risks of deflation.  In a recent interview on Bloomberg&#8217;s Marin Talks Money podcast, Wood responded to a question regarding her preferred asset class to hold for a decade. Without hesitation, she unequivocally favored Bitcoin over gold or cash, highlighting its unique characteristics that make it an effective safeguard against both inflation and deflation. Related Reading: XRP Hits $0.6 In Unstoppable Surge: How High Can It Go This November? Wood emphasized Bitcoin&#8217;s inherent resilience against counterparty risk, along with its decentralized nature, which tends to discourage excessive institutional interference. Describing Bitcoin as the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; of the contemporary financial realm, Wood&#8217;s endorsement adds further credibility to Bitcoin&#8217;s position as a resilient and promising investment option. The current price of Bitcoin according to CoinGecko stands at $34,557, with a slight 24-hour dip of 1.8% countered by a modest seven-day gain of 1.3%. These fluctuations further underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the ongoing developments that continue to shape the trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s value.  Amidst these fluctuations, the overarching sentiment remains bullish, emphasizing the growing recognition of Bitcoin&#8217;s significance in the global financial landscape.  (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.

    "description": "ProShares, one of the biggest issuers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has added another Ethereum-related ETF to its growing offerings following the launch of the “world’s first Short Ether-Linked ETF” on November 2.  ProShares Short Ethereum Strategy ETF In its announcement, the asset manager mentioned that the ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF trading under the ticker ‘SETH’ will provide an avenue for investors to profit from declines in the price of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ether.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are Moving SHIB Again, Bearish Or Bullish? With the launch of this Ethereum investment vehicle, the company believes that its clients have an opportunity to “profit both on days when Ether increases and when it drops.” It is worth mentioning that the asset manager was one of those who recently launched their Ethereum futures ETF, offering investors the chance to bet on the prices of the crypto token. The Asset manager mentioned that the Short Ether Strategy ETF will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will deliver the opposite of the daily performance of the S&#38;P CME Ether Futures Index. As to exposure, SETH, like other ProShares crypto-related ETFs, will gain exposure through Ether futures contracts.  ETH price falls below $1,800 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com How ProShares Has Blazed The Trail So Far ProShares is no newcomer when it comes to offering crypto-related ETFs and can even be said to be a trailblazer in that regard. The firm was the first to launch a Bitcoin futures ETF and the first US Bitcoin-linked ETF (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF) back in 2021.  It also launched the first US short Bitcoin-Linked ETF (ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF) in June 2022. Similar to the SETH, the Short Bitcoin Strategy provides investors an avenue to make profits off declines in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Rally Threatened As Exchange Drops BCH Following XRP Listing Rumors ProShares has also enjoyed immense success in its ventures thanks in a big way to the first-mover advantage by being the first to launch funds. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI) are reported to be the two largest Bitcoin ETFs with $1.1 billion and $80 million assets under management (AuM) respectively.  Other crypto-linked ETFs offered by the firm include ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which is said to be “the first US ETF that targets the performance of Ether,” and the Bitcoin &#38; Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF and Bitcoin &#38; Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF which tracks both the performance of Bitcoin and Ether.  Considering how bullish the firm seems to be on crypto-related ETFs, it is surprising that it isn’t part of the asset managers that have filed to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF.  Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
