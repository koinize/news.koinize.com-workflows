Since the beginning of the year, RON tokens have increased by 59% in value.</p><p>\"This means the increase in reward value did not drive meaningful outcomes in DEX liquidity provision and may have gone past the optimal level of incentives,\" Ronin staff concluded. As a result of the planned LP cuts, Ronin expects to save 2 million RON ($5.72 million) in expenses in Q1 2024 alone. \"Fewer emissions mean lower inflation in circulating supply,\" Ronin said, pointing out that the supply of fixed tokens is fixed at 1 billion.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sky-mavis-slash-ronin-dex-liquidity-rewards-50-percent\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
