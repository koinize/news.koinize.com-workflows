In the months that followed total crypto payments dropped off, falling to an average of around $34 (50 Australian dollars) per week. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/b8f8769e-ad4a-44b2-90e2-c7bae9a6dace.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Shiba Wings diner.

Instead, Elijah said he's more focused on serving up good quality food and building the Shiba Wings brand itself. </p><blockquote>“[Crypto payments] were more of an add-on feature. You generally don't want to be using your crypto to make payments, or you’ll end up like that Bitcoin guy that bought the Pizzas.”</blockquote><p>“I actually advise people not to spend lots of crypto here. I say ‘listen I would keep that, probably not a coin you'd want to use on food, maybe use a different one that you hold a lot more of,’” Elijah said.</p><p>Elijah said his goal was to use the crypto element as a way to create a fast food franchise that could compete with McDonalds, mainly by leveraging the Shiba Inu brand.</p><p>The Shiba Inu community has a large, international following.
