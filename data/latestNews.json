Despite outstanding legal and technical issues, Citi is convinced that blockchain technology could transform the private equity industry.</p><p>The project used simulated workflows in a Wellington Management-issued private equity fund with ABN AMRO acting as the investor and WisdomTree simulating the platform on the permissioned Avalanche Evergreen Spruce Subnet. </p><p>The partners tested smart contracts to enforce distribution rules for a simulated fund. They used a variety of methods to verify identities provided by WisdomTree and partnered with DTCC Digital Assets to use a private fund token as collateral in an automated lending contract.
