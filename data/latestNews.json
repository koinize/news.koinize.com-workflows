    "description": "<p>The SEC has requested four more months to respond to Coinbase&rsquo;s call for crypto regulatory clarity. </p>\n<p>The US SEC said in a June 13 letter to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that it requires an additional four months, or 120 days, to respond to Coinbase&rsquo;s request for it to provide clarity regarding the cryptocurrency industry.</p>\n<p>The SEC filed the letter in response to an order made on June 6 which asked the agency to address Coinbase&rsquo;s call for clarity or if it needs more time to formulate a response.</p>\n<p>The SEC&rsquo;s latest comments come after a string of court filings from both the agency and Coinbase&rsquo;s part.</p>\n<p>Coinbase filed a writ of mandamus against the SEC after the regulator said it was in no hurry to respond to the exchange&rsquo;s demands for regulatory clarity. In its filing, Coinbase accused the agency of purposefully ignoring its petitions for adopting clear rules for the crypto industry.</p>\n<p>The exchange filed the petition after the SEC said it would not entertain Coinbase&rsquo;s request for immediate clarity of cryptocurrency regulations.</p>\n<p>On May 15, the SEC filed a response to a previous petition by Coinbase and said it was not prepared to give into the exchange&rsquo;s demands.</p>\n<p>The agency further stated it is not obligated to meet the requirements set out in Coinbase&rsquo;s petition. It said the exchange requested complex rulemaking in an unreasonably short amount of time.</p>\nCoinbase Demands Regulatory Clarity\n<p>The SEC&rsquo;s May 15 refusal was in response to a narrow action file by Coinbase in April compelling the agency to give a &lsquo;yes or no&rsquo; answer to a petition filed in July 2022.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;2022 petition outlines a list of questions seeking clarity on the nature of securities and how the SEC determines whether an asset is a security.</p>\n<p>Coinbase filed a previous petition on March 20&nbsp;requesting the agency exclude staking from its list of securities.</p>\nNew Regulations Are Urgently Needed: The SEC Disagrees\n<p>In its refusal to give into Coinbase&rsquo;s request for regulatory clarity, the SEC argued new regulations are necessary as it deems digital assets securities. The agency said:</p>\n\n<p>The rulemaking petition as to which Coinbase seeks an immediate determination asks the Commission to take a series of discretionary actions to replace existing applicable securities laws and regulations with a comprehensive new regulatory regime for the trading of crypto assets that are securities.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC&rsquo;s reluctance to provide the US with a more precise and comprehensive regulatory regime is particularly concerning at the moment. The agency launched severe action against Coinbase and its rival Binance, accusing both of alleged securities violations.</p>\n<p>The move caused panic across the board, highlighting the need for clarity.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
