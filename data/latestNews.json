    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-jump-in-january/",
    "description": "Most cryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA) currently going through a consolidation period after weeks of intense price growth in December. Data from Coinmarketcap shows the big cryptos posting declines in a seven-day timeframe, with some even plunging by double digits.¬† Cardano hasn&#8217;t been left out, as it is currently down by 9.20% and 15.3% in the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. However, according to one crypto analyst, Cardano (ADA) could be gearing up for a 30-40% price surge that sends the token well past $0.80 this month. Cardano Consolidating After Price Surge Cardano has been on a nice price surge, reaching a peak of 170% price gain in the last quarter of 2023. At the time of writing, the crypto is still up by 35% in the past 30 days despite the ongoing consolidation. According to a technical analysis shared by crypto analyst Captain Faibik on social media, Cardano is currently in a bullish pennant formation on the daily timeframe. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Blasts $20,000 XRP Price Target, Reveals Why It‚Äôs Impossible Bullish pennant patterns are formed after an uptrend and indicate a continuation of the upward trend during a consolidation. For Cardano, the pole was a 77% price rally from $0.3759 to $0.6655 in the first two weeks of December.¬† It then traded in increasingly higher lows and lower highs, creating the pennant shape. If the pennant pattern holds, the analyst envisions a bullish breakout which would lead to a 30% to 40% bullish rally to the $0.8 price level.¬† $ADA Bullish Pennant formation..!! Looks Promising for the Another +30-40% Bullish Rally..üìà#Crypto #Cardano #ADA pic.twitter.com/53rYFF5Ws9 ‚Äî Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) January 2, 2024 ADA price falls to $0.55 &#124; Source: ADAUSD On Tradingview.com What‚Äôs Next For ADA Price? Cardano is currently trading at $0.5567 with a 115% increase in 24-hour trading volume. Several indicators point to the cryptocurrency going on a price growth this year, along with the entire crypto industry.¬† For one, IntoTheBlock&#8217;s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio of 3.09 suggests that the Cardano chain is currently undergoing high network transaction value against its market cap, which is often a bullish sign. Related Reading: Solana Has Flipped Ethereum In Yet Another Metric In Its Bid To Reach $200 In fact, the surge in December and the current consolidation in early January are still in line with a prediction by crypto analyst Ali Martinez last year, who used historical data to predict a 2,300% surge to $6. Once Cardano‚Äôs price pushes above $0.64 with strong volume, that will confirm the uptrend is ready to continue. On the other hand, if Cardano were to turn the support level of $0.55 level into a resistance barrier on the daily timeframe, it could denote weakness from the bulls which would negate the bullish sentiment in the short term. In such a case, we could see Cardano&#8217;s price continue to decline to the $0.5 level. Featured image from Zipmex, chart from Tradingview.com"
