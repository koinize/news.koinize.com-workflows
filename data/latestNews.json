    "description": "Solana (SOL) has reached a new 22-month high, demonstrating a remarkable 28% uptrend over the past month. However, the Solana-based meme coin, Bonk Inu (BONK), has captured investors&#8217; attention with its explosive performance last month.  Bonk Inu Outperforms PEPE According to CoinGecko data, BONK has achieved a staggering 102% price uptrend in the last 7 days and an impressive 103% increase in the past month, reaching a trading price of $0.00002510 and attaining a 3-month high.  In addition, the meme coin has experienced significant growth in market capitalization, reaching $1.6 billion and surpassing renowned tokens such as Pepe Coin (PEPE) to secure the 66th position among all cryptocurrencies, highlighting the growing interest in BONK as the cryptocurrency market experiences a resurgence of bullish sentiment fueled by Bitcoin’s (BTC) price uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Get Aggressive As Traders Set Sights on $4,000 Amid Market Frenzy Accumulating data from blockchain company Lookonchain shows the growing interest in Bonk Inu. In addition to the 50% increase in a single day, one wallet reportedly accumulated 98 billion BONK ($1.54 million) from the centralized crypto exchange (CEX) Binance just before the price increase.  According to Lookonchain, the SmartMoney wallet currently holds 319.44 billion BONK tokens worth approximately $7 million, enjoying a profit of $2.9 million, which could have further contributed to the price surge in the past 24 hours.  As of the latest update, the trading volume of Bonk Inu stands at $794,842,219 in the last 24 hours, demonstrating a substantial 74.30% increase compared to the previous day. This surge in trading volume indicates a recent rise in market activity surrounding the meme coin, reflecting growing investor participation and attention. Potential Pullback Ahead?  As the token enjoys one of its best trading months since its launch, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa expressed positive sentiment towards Bonk Inu, highlighting its potential for further growth.  Altcoin Sherpa stated that Bonk Inu looks promising due to its relative underperformance compared to other meme coins, coupled with a notable uptrend pattern. The analyst wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Bonk Inu target previous highs and make further gains, although he suggested that a potential pullback may occur. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Hits Levels That Led To Parabolic Bull Run In 2020 As the analyst suggests, the $0.00001940 price level may serve as a crucial support level for the BONK token in the event of a potential pullback or price correction. This level is significant as it would help maintain the current uptrend pattern observed on its daily chart.  However, suppose this support level fails to hold. In that case, it&#8217;s possible that BONK could see a further price decline towards the $0.00001500 level, which acts as the ultimate support before a potential drop to the $0.00001350 mark, key for the token&#8217;s prospects as it represents the last line of defense to prevent a fully formed downtrend in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s performance. On the other hand, when analyzing the BONK/USD 1-W chart, it is important to note that there are no prominent resistance levels. The chart above shows thin lines known as &#8220;wicks&#8221; above the candlesticks of the token since its launch on December 15th.  This suggests that no significant obstacles prevent the token from reaching its all-time high of $0.0005487. The ability to maintain its current uptrend or potentially experience renewed bullish sentiment after a pullback will determine whether BONK can surpass this previous high.
