    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/analyst-predicts-2450-xrp-price-surge/",
    "description": "In a detailed analysis, crypto analyst Egrag has forecasted a remarkable 2450% rise in the XRP price, citing a bullish crossover in the 2-week XRP market cap chart, where the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has exceeded the 55 Moving Average (MA). This pattern is typically seen as a precursor to substantial price increases. Egrag, through a post via X, emphasized the significance of this development: &#8220;XRP CONFIRMED KABOOM: [&#8230;] On the 2-Week Time Frame, we&#8217;ve witnessed an exciting development as the 21 EMA has crossed over the 55 MA. This bullish crossover historically signifies the onset of significant price explosions.&#8221; Bullish Crossover Heralds Massive XRP Price Surge The analysis highlights two previous instances where similar patterns led to significant price movements. The first, referred to as &#8220;Kaboom A,&#8221; occurred between early 2015 and early 2017. During this phase, XRP&#8217;s market capitalization varied between $142.642 million and $349.476 million. Following the bullish crossover of the 21 EMA over the 55 EMA in the 2-week chart, XRP&#8217;s market cap experienced a significant rise, breaking through the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $2.592 billion and peaking at over $126 billion in January 2018. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Declares Intent To Bring XRP Battle To Supreme Court From December 2020 to April 2021, there was a shorter cycle. Again, a bullish crossover of the 21 EMA above the 55 MA in the 2-week chart was seen initially. As a result, the XRP market capitalization rose from $.7.67 billion to over $88 billion (and with it the price to $1.96) In the current &#8220;confirmed KABOOM Cycle&#8221;, XRP&#8217;s market cap is hovering above the $35.235 billion mark, which again equates to the 0.5 Fibonacci level. At press time, it stood at $37.516 billion. Delving into the current situation, Egrag explained: Notably, in the previous &#8216;Kaboom A&#8217; phase, the Fib 0.5 level acted as a clear launch pad. In the current &#8216;Confirmed KABOOM Cycle,&#8217; XRP&#8217;s Market Cap is once again rebounding from Fib 0.5, hinting at an imminent &#8216;Kaboom Cosmic Ignition.&#8217; However, XRP&#8217;s market capitalization is currently facing several key levels. Egrag emphasizes the critical nature of the $51.3 billion market cap, which coincides with the 0.702 Fibonacci level. A close above this threshold on the 2-week chart could trigger a significant rally for XRP, or as Egrag puts it: &#8220;XRP closing above the $51.3 billion Fib 0.702 level could be the watershed moment for our victory.&#8221; Related Reading: Third Ever XRP Bull Signal Is Back: What To Expect Remarkably, Egrag highlights another crucial resistance level in his chart, a descending trend line (dashed red line) that has formed since the peak in January 2018. According to Egrag, a breakout above this level could trigger a rally of more than 2450% (from the current market cap and price). The final target for the XRP market cap could be the 1,618 Fibonacci extension level at $283.489 billion and the 2,618 Fibonacci extension level at $959.663 billion. The latter would translate to an XRP price of $17.94. Questions From The Community In response to questions from the community, Egrag explained the significance of the $51.3 billion level: &#8220;This is a macro resistant range, because closing multiple weekly candles above this range means u will never see XRP below this price or in cents, we will see XRP price only in dollars.&#8221; When inquired about the likelihood of another price test prior to an increase, Egrag conceded, &#8220;Possible but it will be a wicking process while we are sleeping,&#8221; suggesting that any pullbacks could be short-lived. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6928. Featured image from Kanchanara / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"
