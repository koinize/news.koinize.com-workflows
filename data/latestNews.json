    "description": "<p>Bitcoin has remained trapped in a downward channel since the latter part of June. With the last couple of days of positive price action, is bitcoin now ready to go higher?</p>\nA bull flag breakout?\n<p>Bitcoin has been in an accumulation phase for the past seven weeks. Following a spike higher from a mid-June low of $24,800, the price almost reached $32,000 before rolling over and following the downwards channel it is currently trying to free itself from.</p>\n<p>Positive price action since Monday saw bitcoin emerge from its bull flag. However, Wednesday sees price trying to hold the top of the flag. Whether it is successful or not will signal the next phase of price action. If the breakout of the bull flag does get confirmed, bitcoin has the possibility to go much higher, with a measured move out of the flag taking it to $35,000, which would potentially turn $30,000 into new support.</p>\n<p>However, failure to break out of the flag can bring bitcoin ever closer to its major support of the uptrend which is underpinned by the 200-day moving average. A bounce here would be even more likely.</p>\nBears and bulls evenly balanced\n<p>In fact the chart and fundamentals for bitcoin do look ridiculously bullish. It therefore has to be wondered why there is still so much bearish sentiment around the number one crypto asset?</p>\n<p>The Fear and Greed Index has been oscillating around the Neutral 50 value since the beginning of the year, signalling that bitcoin is balanced on a 50/50 market sentiment for higher or lower prices.</p>\n<p>It appears that something is needed to tip bitcoin one way or the other, and despite regulatory overhang of the crypto industry and the extremely negative pursuit of the foremost crypto exchanges of Binance and Coinbase by the SEC, there is still enough positive sentiment to balance things up.</p>\nWhy keep currency in the bank?\n<p>In bitcoin&rsquo;s favour, it does have to be wondered why people would choose to keep their fiat currency in banks. On the one hand there is the resulting reduction in purchasing power of fiat currency as central banks print more of it in order to pay debts.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are the banks themselves. Only propped up by the printing out of thin air of their own central banks. As exposure to commercial real estate and other bad debts become due, the central banks are going to have to hammer further on the keyboard digits in order to inflate even further.</p>\n<p>If one is to add all this negativity to the fact that we are living in an age where banks are becoming obsolescent, then all the currency being poured into propping them up would just appear to lead to much more pain for the average citizen, who must bear this cost through inflation and an accelerating loss in purchasing power.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "PEPE has emerged as a symbol of resilience in the face of uncertainty in the broader meme coin market. A timely intervention by a deep-pocketed investor, an anonymous whale, has breathed new life into the frog-themed token, giving it a shot in the arm.  In the unpredictable flow of the crypto space, the influence of well-to-do cryptocurrency whales has come into focus. These influential investors hold the power to sway market dynamics, often leaving smaller traders in their wake. The recent resurgence of PEPE is a striking illustration of the impact these whales can exert.  Related Reading: Cardano False Breakdown: Could It Set The Stage For A 26% Climb? According to Lookonchain’s data, a substantial investment of 1 million USDC secured a staggering 807 billion PEPE tokens, all acquired at an ostensibly modest price of $0.000001239 per token. This calculated move was spurred by a noticeable surge in PEPE&#8217;s market valuation. A whale spent 1M $USDC to buy 807B $PEPE at $0.000001239 7 hrs ago after the price of $PEPE increased.https://t.co/P03KsDrzFi pic.twitter.com/0hjW6ewDjp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 9, 2023 Whales: Catalysts Of PEPE&#8217;s Reawakening Notably, such substantial investments serve not only as a financial injection but also as a confidence boost within the PEPE community. The actions of this anonymous whale have ignited a renewed sense of hope, accentuating the noteworthy role that these influential figures play in steering the course of the cryptocurrency landscape. As PEPE tries to go up, there&#8217;s an important point coming up: the 50-day moving average resistance. This point is really important because it shows how strong PEPE is and where it might go next. If PEPE can go past this point, it could start climbing even more, bringing lots of positivity and interest to PEPE. PEPE sees a slight increase in price. Chart at TradingView.com CoinGecko data currently places PEPE&#8217;s price at $0.00000124, down 1.5% in the last day, but managed to sustain a weekly gain of 2.3%. These measured yet consistent advances underscore the inherent resilience that PEPE continues to exhibit, even in the face of broader market fluctuations. Source: Coingecko PEPE &#38; Community Engagement&#8217;s Impact Lunarcrush&#8217;s data cited in a recent price analysis demonstrates a 1.9% increase in social interactions and an impressive surge of 28.25% in social mentions. This surge in online discussions underscores the vital role that community engagement plays in shaping the trajectory of meme coins like PEPE. Further enhancing the narrative, weighted sentiment, a pivotal marker of market sentiment, has recently experienced an upward swing. This shift indicates a heightened degree of positivity surrounding PEPE in online dialogues. Such shifts in sentiment often foreshadow broader market movements, potentially setting the stage for a notable resurgence of the token.
