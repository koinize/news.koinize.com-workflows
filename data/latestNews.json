The regulator <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pressed 13 charges against Binance</a> on June 5, including those involving unregistered offerings and sales of tokens, and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer. The commission also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >went after Coinbase</a> on similar grounds, alleging that popular cryptocurrencies offered by the exchange are securities. Trading volume across the major decentralized exchanges <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-coinbase-binance-lawsuits-surge-defi-trading-volumes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >jumped 444% in the hours</a> following the legal actions.

In its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-s-binance-suit-contains-heady-mix-of-predictable-charges-novel-revelations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >case against Binance</a>, the SEC introduced 10 cryptocurrencies into the securities classification, while it named 13 cryptocurrencies in its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Coinbase suit</a>.

The transaction caused a minor stir in the Twitter cryptoverse, as Armstrong avoided a sharp loss by doing so. SEC records show that Armstrong sold 29,730 shares of the company on June 5, the day before the SEC suit. Armstrong has been selling Coinbase stock regularly since November under a 10b5-1 plan adopted in August, which determines the timing and size of transactions in advance. The net worths of Armstrong and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-lawsuits-coinbase-binance-ceos-net-worths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >have suffered heavy blows due to the suits</a>.
