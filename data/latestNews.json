In the future, the goal is to make the process as permissionless as releasing apps on the web.</p><p>The upgrade — which Morris said is coming sometime later this year — will see users download third-party extensions to their MetaMask wallet.</p><p>These will allow them to use their MetaMask wallet with non-EVM chains including Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche and Starknet. </p><blockquote>“MetaMask starts with a massive assumption there's going to be an EVM or something very like Ethereum, so what we’re targeting for the first release is making MetaMask interoperable with other non-EVM chains.”</blockquote><p>Snaps will also help to reduce the obscurity around signing transactions. Morris admitted at present, users are oftentimes left feeling confused or intimidated when confirming transactions and hinted that some of the soon-to-be-released Snaps will help make the process of signing transactions and assessing smart contracts less opaque at first glance. </p><p>Another feature set to be enabled by Snaps will allow developers to send messages to users internally on MetaMask.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-future-is-very-clear-metamask-to-support-all-tokens-via-snaps\"><strong><em>‘Multichain future is very clear’ — MetaMask to support all tokens via Snaps</em></strong></a></p><p>Instead of users having to navigate to the website or social media account of a project for updates — the upgrades will enable a “communication layer between DApp developers and their users.”</p><p>For those wanting a taste of Snaps, Morris said users can download an application called MetaMask Flask but warned that it’s very much a tool for developers. </p><p>On Sept. 5 MetaMask introduced its newest “sell” feature, allowing users in the United States, United Kingdom and parts of Europe to exchange Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-launches-sell-function-exchange-eth-fiat\">for fiat currency</a> that can be sent directly to a bank account.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are beyond thrilled to announce our latest feature: Sell. <br><br>Yes, you read that right.
