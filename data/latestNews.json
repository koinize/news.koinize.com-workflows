All platforms must display a message that reads:</p><blockquote> “Cryptocurrencies are high risk. Please study and understand the risks of cryptocurrencies thoroughly, because you may lose the entire investment amount.” </blockquote><p>The warning message must be clearly visible, and before customers can use the service the business operator must arrange for the service users to give consent and acknowledge such risks before using the service.</p><p>Apart from a trading risks disclaimer, the new guidelines also prohibit service providers from using customer’s funds for lending or investment.</p><p>The Thai SEC has banned crypto lending services, thus prohibiting crypto platforms from offering any form of return on deposited crypto by customers.

The new regulations are set to come into effect from July 31, 2023.</p><p>The discussion around new regulations for investor protection began on September 1, 2022, when the SEC approved the need for security warnings by cryptocurrency business operators to disclose the risks of trading cryptocurrencies. The rules that prohibit digital asset business operators from providing services or <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/thai-sec-to-tighten-up-rules-for-crypto-focus-on-investor-protection\">supporting deposit-taking and lending services were discussed during meetings</a> on December 1, 2022, and May 11, 2023. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-bitkub-targeted-by-thai-sec-with-wash-trading-claims\"><strong><em>Crypto exchange Bitkub targeted by Thai SEC with wash trading claims</em></strong></a></p><p>The new investor protection rules come in the wake of the massive crypto lending crisis during the bear market in 2022. A significant chunk of crypto lending firms, who collected billions in customer deposits by promising hefty returns, went bust during the bear market. Leading lending firms, including <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-bankruptcy-proceedings-show-complexities-amid-declining-hope-of-recovery\">Celsius and BlockFi,</a> filed for bankruptcy - resulting in investor money getting stuck in bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-miami-2023-shitcoins-for-bitcoin/\"><strong><em>Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with ‘shitcoins on Bitcoin’</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
