    "description": "Bitcoin continues to maintain its momentum toward the upward trajectory, touching the $68,000 price mark earlier today, leading to speculations about how long it will take to hit a new peak. Bitcoin To Reach $70,000 In A Matter Of Time With the price action of Bitcoin today, several crypto analysts are bullish about BTC as they believe that the crypto asset could reach a new peak very soon. The digital asset recently touched the $68,000 threshold for the first time in nearly 3 years, placing it just short of capping off a notable recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Proves European Central Bank Wrong: Hits All-Time High Against Euro In a post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Crypto Jelle has expressed his bullish optimism toward BTC with the community. His predictions examine Bitcoin&#8217;s current price position and its potential to surpass its all-time high. According to the crypto expert, the price of BTC is just &#8220;inches away&#8221; from reaching unprecedented heights. He pointed out that the coin tried to break through its current peak but was unsuccessful. Additionally, he noted that the crypto asset is presently &#8220;retesting the 4-Hour 25 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50 Relative Strength Index (RSI).&#8221; Nonetheless, crypto Jelle believes that &#8220;both trends are good entries that could trigger a bounce&#8221; to a new level. As a result, the analyst has predicted the asset to reach &#8220;$70,000 in only a matter of time.&#8221; Furthermore, he has urged the community to be patient as this is the &#8220;name of the game.&#8221; The post read: Bitcoin is within inches of a new all-time high. Rejected on its first attempt, but now retesting the 4-Hour 25E MA and the RSI 50 level. Both tend to be good entries for a bounce. $70,000 is a matter of time, and patience remains the name of the game. As Bitcoin continues to rally, the token&#8217;s fear and greed index seems to have also skyrocketed. Jelle has also highlighted in another post that BTC&#8217;s &#8220;fear and greed index are presently reaching extreme levels.&#8221; However, this does not imply that we will be seeing a pullback, according to the expert. He then clarified that as of the time Bitcoin surpassed $20,000, the fear and greed index was higher than it is now while urging investors not to be &#8220;shaken out&#8221; of the market. BTC Could Hit $150,000 Before 2024 Closes The head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, has also shared his optimism toward BTC in an interview with CBNC. Tom Lee&#8217;s optimistic overview came in light of the asset drawing close to its peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally: Crypto Analyst Says New Peak Is Within Arms’ Reach According to Lee, he believes that Bitcoin is heading straight back towards its &#8220;long-term trendline.&#8221; Due to this, he has placed his price target at &#8220;$82,000 in the short term.&#8221; Lee also predicted a long-term price for BTC, putting his target at &#8220;$150,000 before the year closes.&#8221; Presently, Bitcoin is situated at $66,710, up by over 2% in the past day, and above 18% in the past week. CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap and trading volume are up by 2.70% and 70.61% in the past day, respectively. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
