    "description": "Injective Protocol&#8217;s INJ token has just hit a new all-time high of $27.02. However, it appears that the market is currently in a phase of rest and consolidation, with investors cautiously hopeful yet reluctant to drive prices much higher at the moment. The overall trading activity has decreased from its recent peak, leading to a reduction in market volatility. Despite this, the price of INJ has experienced a 12% increase in the last day, currently trading at $25.

So, is there a chance that this rally will last, or will bears ruin the bulls&#8217; Yuletide celebration? Injective&#8217;s native token has experienced a price explosion of over 50% in the previous 30 days, and the steady climb since the lows hit in December 2022 has featured a parabolic rise of over 1,500%. Positive news about the ecosystem and the general bullish mood have driven INJ higher in recent weeks. INJ seven-day price action.

Just below that, at $16 and $15, respectively, you can find support at the 0.5 and 0.618 Fib levels. If INJ&#8217;s rally hits a wall, the stock might retrace to these levels before continuing its ascent. INJ&#8217;s $65K Burn Boosts Weekly Surge Injective&#8217;s weekly token burn has been one of the major triggers for the previous few days. The most recent of these saw the burning of over $65,000 worth of INJ, eliminating them from circulation forever. Injective saw a notable increase in the total amount of INJ staked during the burn auction. There have been almost $1 billion worth of tokens staked thus far, based on on-chain data. A bullish continuation might see buyers target prices above $30. A bearish turn in tandem with a wider market decline may signal a possible decline to $20–$18 range support.
