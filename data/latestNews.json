    "description": "Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform Aptos has experienced a significant surge in key metrics, accompanied by a 12% price rally of its native token APT within the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, the token&#8217;s price approached its all-time high (ATH) level of $19,92, reaching above $19. APT Eyes $20 Milestone Despite the recent price correction across the broader cryptocurrency market, Aptos&#8217; APT token has been on an impressive uptrend since early March. Over the past 30 days, the token has surged by more than 94%, showcasing its strong performance. Aptos has also gained recognition in crypto, climbing to the 23rd position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Currently valued at $7.3 billion, the token has experienced a substantial increase from the $4 billion recorded at the beginning of the month.  Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC’s Shocking $2 Billion Demand The trading volume of Aptos (APT) has seen a significant surge, reaching $542,531,437 in the last 24 hours, a notable 90.70% increase from the previous day, according to CoinGecko data. Analyzing the daily APT/USD chart, no significant resistance levels are observed, indicating that reaching the $20 milestone may be within reach, which would mark a new all-time high for the token.  The sustainability of the bullish momentum and the ability of investors to hold on to their gains will play a key role in determining the coin&#8217;s future performance. Nevertheless, a possible retest of the next support level at $17.36 cannot be ruled out in the event of profit-taking and selling pressure. If the $17.36 support level fails to hold, the next significant support level for APT is at $16.31. However, it is important to note that APT&#8217;s bullish structure remains intact as long as the $12.14 support level remains unbroken, suggesting that the bulls currently have the upper hand as long as a sharp 30% decline does not occur. Aptos Attracts 11 Million Tokenholders In 30 Days Coupled with the increase in the price of its native token, Aptos has seen significant growth in key metrics over the past 30 days. According to Token Terminal data, token holders have grown significantly, increasing by 3.4% to 11.79 million individuals over the past 30 days.  Related Reading: Chainlink Facing Strong Rejection From Profit-Taking, Will CCIP Recharge Demand? In terms of fees generated, Aptos has seen a notable uptick. Over the past 30 days, fees generated were $209.16 thousand, representing a growth rate of 87.8%. Annualized fees reached $2.54 million, a slight increase of 0.2%. In a longer time frame, the Aptos token&#8217;s trading volume has experienced significant expansion, reaching $10.82 billion over the past 30 days, indicating a significant increase of 178.2%.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

    "description": "The positive Bitcoin Coinbase Premium that drove the latest rally above $70,000 has dissipated, suggesting buying has already slowed down. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Returned To Neutral Levels CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explained in a post on X that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has declined back toward the neutral line. The &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Extreme Greed As BTC Breaks $71,000 When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies that the buying pressure on the former is higher than that on the latter platform (or alternatively, the selling pressure on there is just lower). On the other hand, a negative value can imply the selling pressure on Coinbase is higher than on Binance as the price of the cryptocurrency listed there is lower. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few days: The value of the metric appears to have been close to the neutral line recently &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X The chart shows that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had taken to notably positive values as the latest upward push in the asset&#8217;s price had occurred. Since then, though, the metric has fallen, with its value approaching zero. It would seem that the buying pressure on the platform contributed to the surge. The fact that the rally has slowed since the metric returned to neutral levels may add further evidence. This isn&#8217;t unnatural for this year, however, as the Bitcoin price and Coinbase Premium Gap have shown a pretty tight relationship since the start of 2024. Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of American institutional investors, while Binance hosts more global traffic. As such, the premium&#8217;s value provides insight into how the behavior of the US-based large holders differs from that of world users. Since the Coinbase Premium Gap has been the driver of the recent price surges, buying from these institutional entities could potentially have provided the fuel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top In Yet?

Given the close relationship the metric and BTC price have held recently, it may be worth keeping an eye on how things develop in the coming days. BTC may register some decline if the premium flips into the red from here. Naturally, a continuation of positive values would be a bullish sign instead.

    "description": "Chainlink (LINK) has performed strongly over the past week, with the token’s price increasing 21.3% in the last seven days. Some analysts have shared their predictions and thoughts on LINK, suggesting keeping an eye on the token and its long-term performance. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst What Is LINK’s Next Steppingstone? Recently, Chainlink announced its partnership with blockchain platform Avalanche and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum blockchains using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). As reported by NewsBTC, the partnership aims to facilitate the “access, trade, and seamless settlement of tokenized assets across networks in different currencies in a process called Delivery vs. Payment (DvP).” The crypto community appeared to receive the news well. X users expressed their positive sentiments towards the collaboration and Chainlink’s token. The sentiment has seemingly translated to LINK’s performance, as the token’s price soared 9% in the last 24 hours. Crypto analyst and trader The Lord of Entry shared his prediction for LINK. In the X post, the trader highlights that the token’s performance in the past day had been strong as it broke above the $18.5 resistance level. Chainlink’s LINK unsuccessfully tested the resistance zone over the past week after falling below it on March 18. $LINK 4hr &#8211; #LINK has been strong today, but now banging into some resistance &#8211; if it can flip this into support your next big target is around 28#LINKusdt pic.twitter.com/YlCDRDOFTq &#8212; @TheLordofEntry (@thelordofentry) March 26, 2024 The token continued the upward trajectory throughout the day after successfully rising above the $18.5 price. In the early hours of Tuesday, LINK surged above the $20 mark but faced resistance near the $20.5 range. According to the trader, if the token can break above this level and turn it into a support zone, the next big target for LINK would be the $28 price range. As of this writing, LINK tested this new resistance level, which has been rising above it twice in the past hour. The token reached $20.6 in the first attempt and briefly surpassed the $20.7 price range during the second attempt. However, the token momentarily failed to flip the resistance zone and fell below $20.5 again. Chainlink’s “Very Strong” Long-Term Performance Despite the failed attempts, LINK’s price surged 9% in the past 24 hours. Interest in the token has seemingly risen in the same timeframe as its market activity increased by 55.19%, reaching a daily trading volume of $539.9 million. Its market capitalization also increased by 8.16% in the past day, reaching $12.02 billion. Chainlink is the 14th-largest cryptocurrency by this metric, according to CoinMarketCap data. Moreover, LINK has shown a remarkable 182.6% performance in the last year. As a result, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared some notes on LINK, suggesting that it shouldn’t be actively traded. Sherpa stated that the token is a better fit to “buy and hold” as it is a “safe coin that is going to do strong numbers.” $LINK: A few notes w. this one- -you shouldn&#39;t be actively trading this. Loads more volatile coins (though this has nice liquidity) -Better to buy and hold, this is a safe coin that is going to do strong numbers -Still fundamentally v. strong, 1 of the best. -still expecting… pic.twitter.com/NeJAm2ixXj &#8212; Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) March 25, 2024 The analyst considers LINK fundamentally “very strong” and one of the best tokens based on its long-term performance. Ultimately, Sherpa predicts the price will “consolidate for a bit longer before its next move.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Reignites As The Bulls Aim For $4K Chainlink hits $20.6 in the 3-day chart chart.

    "description": "The XRP price continues to disappoint investors who expect that it would’ve crossed $1 by now since Ripple’s battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing its end. However, this has not discouraged investors and traders who believe that there are big things in store for the altcoin. Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Will Reach $6 Pseudonymous crypto analyst Mikybull has been bullish on the XRP price for a long time, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to, once again, reiterate their stance that the altcoin is going to do well. At the start of March, Mikybull had put forward an analysis that showed that the XRP price is primed for an over 800% run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Remove A Staggering $2.3 Billion From Exchanges, Is It Time To Buy? At the time, the crypto analyst pointed out that XRP had broken out of a symmetrical triangle, which is bullish for the price. A similar breakout had taken place back in 2017 which led to an over 1,000% increase in the price, and Mikybull references in the analysis. However, like the rest of the crypto market, XRP ended up dipping as the Bitcoin price crashed from $73,000 to $61,000. But now that the market is starting to recover, the crypto analyst believes that the altcoin is primed for a big move. Over the course of March, Mikybull has consistently talked about this prediction, especially as the price retested various resistance points. Then, on Monday, March 25, the crypto analyst shared another chart showing that the XRP price has completed its retest and is ready to move upward. $XRP It has concluded its retest and it&#8217;s now preparing for an explosive upward move🚀 🎯Targets: $1-$6 https://t.co/3Vsr67s32z pic.twitter.com/Dbdu2kVhpa — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) March 25, 2024 Mikybull shared that the targets for this move lie between $1 and $6, with the upper end of this target being an 833% move from its current price. When Will The XRP Price Hit This Target? While Mikybull does not present a particular timeframe in their analysis, the charts shared provide some insight into when they expect this move to occur for XRP. Just like in 2017, the crypto analyst expects the rally to take place in the same year as the breakout from the symmetrical triangle, which means it could happen this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $50,000 Or $80,000?

Presently, the XRP price is showing a lot of strength after rallying 11.73% in the last week. It is currently trading at $0.648 at the time of writing, with a market cap of $35.5 billion, which makes its the 6th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

    "description": "In the XRP lawsuit, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its motion for remedies and entry of final judgment against Ripple, proposing a suite of penalties that includes injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, and a notable $2 billion in civil penalties today. But that&#8217;s not the whole story as the 210-page document contains some interesting statements and assertions. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The @SECGov has filed its Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, its Memorandum of Law in Support of that Motion, and its &#34;Proposed&#34; Judgment.https://t.co/uPlpJ7Tmon &#8212; James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) March 26, 2024 Did Ripple Favor Select Institutional Investors? One of the assertions made in the SEC document and pointed out by XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan was a key revelation that Ripple engaged in discriminatory pricing practices, offering substantial discounts on XRP tokens to a select group of institutional investors. This practice, the SEC alleges, created an uneven playing field, benefiting certain &#8220;favored&#8221; investors at the expense of others. Related Reading: Top Analyst’s Bold Prediction: XRP Set To Skyrocket 1,500% XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan provided a summary of this aspect, highlighting the potential damage to Ripple&#8217;s standing in the eyes of institutional investors. &#8220;The SEC’s brief is a possible problem for Ripple beyond this case. The SEC is able to argue that there were two groups of institutional sales investors (it calls them favored and unfavored) and Ripple offered one group significant discounts in XRP price over the other group that did not receive them,&#8221; Morgan noted via X (formerly Twitter). He further delved into the SEC&#8217;s claim that such practices harmed the &#8220;unfavored&#8221; group of investors to the tune of $480 million, a figure based on assumptions that Morgan suggests need thorough examination. “The evidence of causation of this alleged harm seems thin,” he added. The SEC&#8217;s filing goes on to argue that Ripple&#8217;s sales tactics, specifically the discounted sales to certain investors, directly contributed to downward pressure on the overall market price of XRP. This point is not just a matter of regulatory compliance but also raises the specter of legal action from those institutional investors who may feel aggrieved by not being privy to the same discounts. Related Reading: Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern Morgan also touched upon the ramifications of these actions being classified as investment contracts by the SEC, saying, &#8220;As these sales to institutions were found to be investment contracts, it means that this offering of discounts to some but not other institutions is the very disclosure according to the SEC that should have, and would have been made to the institutions, if the sales to institutions had been registered.&#8221; He further noted that these claims by the SEC are also not great for the reputation of Ripple. “Not sure this revelation is great for Ripple’s reputation with institutional investors,” Morgan remarked. Ripple CLO Alderoty Responds Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also issued a broad response to the SEC&#8217;s filing via X, vehemently disputing the narrative presented by the regulatory body. Alderoty stated, “Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” He further attacked the SEC for its illegitimate reasoning, stating: “They stayed true to form here. Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple &#8211; and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.64365. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
