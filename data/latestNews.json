So in the case of AI, you have a human being inputting information into a program,” he said, adding: </p><blockquote>“So the inputs are coming from people, but the actual expression is coming from the AI itself. Once the information has been inputted, it's essentially out of the hands of the person, as it’s being generated or pumped out by the AI.”</blockquote><p>“I guess until the legislation recognizes machines or robots as being capable of authorship, it's really sort of a gray area and sort of a bit in no man’s land.”<strong></strong></p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/microsoft-s-cso-says-ai-will-help-humans-flourish-cosigns-doomsday-letter-anyway\">Microsoft’s CSO says AI will help humans flourish, cosigns doomsday letter anyway</a></em></strong></p><p>Petale added that it poses a lot of hypothetical questions that first need to be solved by legal proceedings and regulation. </p><p>“I guess the question is; are the creators of the AI responsible for creating the tool that’s used to infringe copyright, or is it the people who are actually using that to infringe on copyright?,” he said. </p><p>From the perspective of AI companies, they generally argue that their models <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-fair-use-us-supreme-court-weighs-in-on-ai-s-copyright-dilemma\">do not infringe on copyright</a> as their AI-bots transform original work into something new, which qualifies as fair use under U.S. laws, where most of the action is kicking off. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><strong><em><u> </u>‘<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/moral-responsibility-how-blockchain-can-improve-ai-trustworthiness/\">Moral responsibility’ — Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
