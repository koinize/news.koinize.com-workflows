The Bitcoin miner has seen its mining pace dropping significantly over the past year, as its monthly mining volumes dropped nearly 60% from 277 BTC <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hut-8-mining-production-and-operations-update-for-september-2022-301639828.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mined</a> in September 2022.</p><p>But despite seeing a notable decline in the amount of monthly-mined Bitcoin, Hut 8 has remained committed to its hodl strategy, which has not been seen among too many miners in the industry.</p><p>“No Bitcoin was sold during the month,” Hut 8 said, stressing that the company owns one of the largest self-mined BTC reserves among publicly traded firms. “Total balance of Bitcoin in reserve was 9,366 on September 30 — 7,269 of which were unencumbered,” the firm added.</p><p>Hut 8’s latest BTC reserve expansion comes in line with the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/amid-miner-capitulation-hut-8-maintained-btc-hodl-strategy-in-july\">company’s long-term hodl strategy</a>.

    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has been in a state of horizontal consolidation since mid-August, as it trades within the narrow range of $0.068 and $0.053. This period of consolidation has been marked by daily charts adorned with short-bodied candlesticks, a visual testament to the lack of enthusiasm from both buyers and sellers.  It&#8217;s a curious phase in the world of DOGE, where the price appears to be biding its time, awaiting a catalyst to break free from this stasis. However, recent market fluctuations have cast a shadow over this tranquility, pushing DOGE closer to a foundational support level, possibly signaling an impending bullish resurgence. Related Reading: What’s Behind XRP Price Retreat? Assessing Some Eye-Opening Metrics Dogecoin Price Analysis Suggests Sideways Movement Recent price analysis indicates that DOGE&#8217;s sideways trend may continue, with the coin hovering near the $0.055 support level within a downsloping trendline. This level, coinciding with a long-standing support trendline, forms a significant accumulation zone.  While DOGE&#8217;s price currently stands at approximately $0.059099 according to CoinGecko, it has experienced a 2.6% decline over the past 24 hours and a 4.9% dip over the last seven days. Should the resistance trendline maintain its influence, DOGE holders may anticipate a potential 7% drop, which could lead to a retest of the year-long support trendline located around the $0.055 region. DOGE market cap reaching the $8.3 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Influential Figures Debate Crypto&#8217;s Inherent Value Meanwhile, on the social media platform X, a lively debate unfolded as two influential figures shared their perspectives on a contentious topic. The discussion was ignited by a statement from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the Coinbase case, where they asserted that &#8220;crypto has &#8216;no innate or inherent value.'&#8221;  This assertion did not go unnoticed by Dogecoin&#8217;s co-founder, Billy Markus, who responded with a pointed critique, emphasizing the taxes he had paid on his cryptocurrency earnings. then return all the taxes y’all made me pay for receiving it you horrific evil hypocrites pic.twitter.com/rwisnADwLe — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) October 9, 2023 Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, renowned for his influential stance on cryptocurrencies, also entered the conversation, offering support to Markus&#8217;s perspective. Musk challenged the regulatory body by posing a rhetorical question: &#8220;It&#8217;s real if you have to pay taxes, but otherwise not real?&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu Stagnation: What’s Causing Meme Coin’s Recent Sluggishness? This exchange by DOGE proponents highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies and the increasing involvement of regulatory bodies.  As the crypto market remains in a state of flux, the perspectives of influential figures like Markus and Musk continue to shape the discourse and influence market sentiment. It remains to be seen how these debates will impact the broader crypto landscape and whether DOGE will break free from its consolidation phase in the near future.
