    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/google-bard-predicts-strong-rally-for-shiba-inu-apecoin-and-everlodge-heres-why",
    "description": "<p class=\"s5\">Pushing the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like Google Bard are now being used for market analysis and predictions. With very high accuracy, these tools are growing in relevancy. Today, Google Bard has stirred excitement in the crypto space, after bullish predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and Everlodge (ELDG).</p>\n<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>\nSummary\n● Shiba Inu is forming a golden cross and can rally by as much as 50%\n● With an expansion of the APE ecosystem, the price of ApeCoin could rally to $2.5\n● Experts predict up to 20x rally as Everlodge allows everyone to invest in real estate\n<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>\nWhy Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally\n<p class=\"s5\">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>\nWhy Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally\n<p class=\"s5\">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>\nWhy Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally\n<p class=\"s5\">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n<p class=\"s14\">Website: https://www.everlodge.io/</p>\n<p class=\"s15\">Telegram: https://t.me/everlodge</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Recently, three cryptocurrencies have been catching the eye of traders - Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Everlodge (ELDG). While the crypto market is a dynamic and ever-expanding landscape, these cryptocurrencies stand out with their unique features and potential for substantial growth. Let&rsquo;s examine these three projects further and find out what makes them so appealing. </p>\nSummary\n- Stellar partners up with Bitso, causing a price increase\n- Dogecoin shows green monthly charts\n- Everlodge to bring outstanding returns for early buyers\n<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>\nStellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments\n<p>Stellar (XLM) is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain industry when it comes to facilitating cross-border transactions. Designed to bridge traditional financial systems with decentralized networks, Stellar&rsquo;s mission is to make money more fluid and accessible globally. </p>\n<p>Additionally, Stellar&rsquo;s partnerships with established financial institutions bolster its credibility.</p>\n<p>Recently, Bitso announced its partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. This partnership aims to improve communication between the world stage and the Latin American crypto ecosystem. As a result, interest in the Stellar crypto rose as its trading volume jumped by 3% overnight, reaching $75,597,416. </p>\n<p>Currently, one Stellar token costs $0.1339. In the past week, it achieved a peak of $0.1450. But,the technical indicators for Stellar are all showing strong buy signals. Therefore, experts remain bullish about it. Consequently, they predict a jump to $0.17 for Stellar by December 2023. </p>\nDogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Market Resilience\n<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) journey from being a playful meme to a resilient cryptocurrency is a testament to its enduring popularity. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has carved out a significant place in the crypto market. Consequently, gaining attention from high-profile individuals and capturing the mainstream spotlight.</p>\n<p>This attention was displayed on the Dogecoin price charts as well. Most notably, the Dogecoin value soared by 4% in the past month alone. Moreover, its trading volume surged by 11.11% overnight, jumping to $318,640,213. One Dogecoin costs $0.0737 with a market cap of $10.3B. </p>\n<p>While its price may experience fluctuations, its strong community engagement and potential for broader adoption continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. Due to all these reasons, bullish experts predict Dogecoin skyrocketing to $0.098 by this year&rsquo;s end. </p>\nEverlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate Investment\n<p>While Stellar and Dogecoin are tokens worth watching, one project may outshine them - Everlodge (ELDG). With a predicted 20% pump coming in August, this upcoming property marketplace is breaking new ground by merging real estate and blockchain technology through fractional ownership and NFTs.</p>\n<p>This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to many real estate assets that were previously out of reach. In other words, you can become a fractional owner of a luxurious home on the blockchain for prices as low as $100. Everlodge accomplishes this by minting NFTs representing high-end villas, homes, and properties and then fractionalizing them. </p>\n<p>Due to this investment method, Everlodge provides greater property ownership transparency, security, and immutability. Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>\n<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n<p class=\"s12\">Website: https://www.everlodge.io/</p>\n<p class=\"s13\">Telegram: https://t.me/everlodge</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Recently, Visa announced its trial of Ethereum (ETH) gas payments via cards, marking a significant milestone toward mainstream crypto adoption. Additionally, the popularity of projects like Pomerdoge (POMD) and its presale has further illustrated the appeal of innovative crypto projects. Today, we will take a closer look at both of these developments. </p>\n<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>\nEthereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement \n<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>\n<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>\n<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>\nPomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance\n<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>\nExploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success\n<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>\nThe Allure of POMD Tokens\n<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>\n<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today\n<p class=\"s14\">Website: https://pomerdoge.com/</p>\n<p class=\"s14\">Telegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-wallet-1005-btc-awakens/",
    "description": "An anonymous Bitcoin wallet holding 1,005 BTC recently woke up after 13 years of dormancy. This dormant wallet was one of the earliest Bitcoin wallets created, having received its first 1,000 BTC transaction in November 2010, just a little over a year after the Bitcoin mainnet launched.  During this time of Bitcoin&#8217;s humble beginnings, its price never even broke above $0.20. However, the recent reactivation of this wallet has sparked speculation of whether a massive sell-off of the coins could be incoming. 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 1,005 #BTC (29,750,772 USD) has just been activated after 12.8 years!https://t.co/rLkpUZUvfH — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 14, 2023 Cold Storage Just Turned Hot Reactivation of old and dormant wallets containing massive amounts like this often sparks speculation about who controls them, especially as dormant wallets get reactivated from time to time.  2023, in particular, has witnessed a high number of these Bitcoin wallets coming back to life. According to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, the number of bitcoins that are between 7 and 10 years old has demonstrated an exceptionally significant increase in the most recent months.  Using the SOAB indicator, investors are able to determine the age of Bitcoins currently available on the market as the lifespan of bitcoins is broken down into distinct ages.  Kirill Kretov, a developer who specializes in the creation of automated trading programs, believes that the reactivation may have been carried out by the same entity. Considering its age, some Bitcoin investors also suggest this wallet might belong to Satoshi Nakamoto himself. However, this case would be very unlikely, as nobody knows who the Bitcoin creator actually is.  BTC price falls to $28,500 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Selling Pressure Incoming? On-chain data shows that the last transaction on this wallet was in April 2011, where it received 5 BTC. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that the price of Bitcoin at this time was around $1.99.  However, due to the consistent growth of Bitcoin over the last decade, the owner of this wallet now has over $29 million worth of Bitcoin at their disposal at the current BTC/USD exchange rates. This represents a gain of over 8.8 million percent from the wallet&#8217;s last transaction.  This move could be bearish though if they decided to sell all of their holdings, it could introduce a fair amount of selling pressure on Bitcoin and cause the price to drop, at least temporarily. However, the owner has only moved the BTC to another wallet and not an exchange, suggesting they are more interested in HODLing &#8211; the option least likely to impact the market since the BTC would remain dormant. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $28,501, down 2.24% in the last day. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
