This includes the loss of $471.43 million in 108 protocol attacks, $108 million in various phishing scams, and $75.87 million over 110 rug pulls. For hacks, the amount represented a significant decrease over H1 2022 and H2 2022, where $1.91 billion and $1.69 billion were lost, respectively. In addition, Beosin analysts wrote:</p><blockquote>\"Approximately $215 million of stolen assets were recovered, accounting for 45.5% of all stolen assets. In contrast, in 2022, only 8% were recovered. $113 million of stolen assets were transferred to mixers: $45.38M into Tornado Cash and $68.14M into other mixers.\"</blockquote><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.footprint.network/@Beosin/Footprint-Beosin-H1-2023-Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">dashboard</a> compiled by Beosin and Footprint Analytics, only one project was hacked for more than $100 million, that being Euler Finance's $195 million flash loan hack on March 13.
