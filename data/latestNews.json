If they have less yield than expected, then they receive a payout immediately. In the traditional insurance space, they need to wait six months.

That is a huge change. We see that traditional insurance companies are somehow dipping into this.\"</p><p>Stephan Rind, from BrickMark Group, noted that asset tokenization can deliver access to financial products that are currently unavailable to most people, thus helping to close a gap in wealth distribution. </p><p>\"Number one in financial inclusion, obviously you can have a number of participants that can participate in a financial instrument, and you have the democratization of capital [...] everything from real estate to animals, to all the things that you can have in traditional finance, that could actually be tokenized and represented in a digital financial instrument,\" Rind commented. </p><p>Carlos Mazzi, from Finka, shared his experience of tokenizing La Pradera, a cattle ranch in Bolivia with 3,000 hectares of grassland and over 3,500 cows. \"We tokenize the value creation of what we call from grass to cash. It's the tokenization of value creation. The conversion of grass into protein, and into cash through a great nature given machine, which is a cow. We were early pioneers and this was very challenging [...] it represented a lot of financial engineering, legal framework, etc. to create a revenue token. So it has been fantastic [...] The only thing that has not developed the way we anticipated is the market adoption, and it's a systemic issue that, we hope, will be corrected eventually.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/97414433-2176-4be3-98cc-4305befec06c.jpeg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Tokenized ranch La Pradera in Bolivia.
