This would have resulted in the substantial depletion of funds available to be distributed for the benefit of creditors.”</blockquote><p>He added that the intention behind the receivership was to “achieve a speedy and optimum outcome to creditors.”</p><p>A report by legal firm Kroll confirmed that Trigon’s failure was caused by several factors including the collapse of FTX. It was also compounded by legal action taken against the firm by customers for the return of funds.</p><p>Kroll also investigated several large transactions before the collapse of FTX, these were to Salerno himself and his wife. Salerno said that the payments queried in the Kroll report were made in “the context of bringing employee entitlements up to date” given a pending sale of the company.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-stock-exchange-officially-abandons-blockchain-plans-report\"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Australian stock exchange officially abandons blockchain plans: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>Sydney-based investor King River Capital is among the creditors.
