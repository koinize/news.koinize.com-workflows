During that time, the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-total-value-locked-tvl-in-crypto-and-why-does-it-matter\">total value locked (TVL)</a> across DeFi <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-briefly-hits-69k-ath-before-plummeting-back-to-earth\">rose to nearly $180 billion</a> before crashing down to earth. </p><p>After the past few weeks of the BTC price crossing the $30,000 threshold, some are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoins-great-accumulation-binance-us-resumes-fiat-withdrawals-and-other-news-hodlers-digest-june-18-24/\">speculating if the market is gearing up for another bull run</a>. That could signal interest from both veterans of past cycles and those new to crypto to get interested in DeFi, and Cointelegraph Research’s latest report is here to help give insights to past, present and future DeFi users. </p><p class=\"post-content__accent post-content__accent_small\"><a href=\"https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/detail/investing-in-defi-a-comprehensive-guide\"><em>Download the report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.</em></a></p><p>“Investing in DeFi: A Comprehensive Guide” report is a perfect start for those new to blockchain, giving an overview of DeFi. Throughout the report are links and references to all the useful resources and tools to help individuals conduct their own due diligence before investing in anything. Cointelegraph Research and Cointelegraph Markets Pro collaborated on several areas of the report to bring tips and tricks to help DeFi users with fundamental analysis to help mitigate the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. </p><h2>More growth for DeFi in the near future?</h2><p>Before investing in DeFi, it would be important to know the potential for the sector to grow if there is increased interest in the future. If we look at the chart below of DeFi’s dramatic rise during the 2021 DeFi Summer, it would seem to indicate that there is plenty of room to grow to at least the levels achieved during the last bull cycle.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/05122545-8984-4f8b-b2f4-d5bcaa023f8c.png\"  /></figure><p>There is no guarantee that the crypto markets will replicate the move, but it does indicate that there was at one point a market appetite for DeFi at these levels. The question potential investors have to ask themselves is: “Is there more or less adoption today than in the past?” and “Could there be more or less adoption in the future than today?”</p><h2>So many tools, so little time </h2><p>Unlike the early days of cryptocurrency, there is a multitude of different tools and applications at DeFi participants’ fingertips. It would be impossible to put all of the different solutions that have been founded and launched into one chart. </p><p>The illustration below serves as a starting point for DeFi investors to begin researching the different protocols and possible investments in the cryptoverse. <a href=\"https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/detail/investing-in-defi-a-comprehensive-guide\">Cointelegraph Research’s latest report</a> is a starting place to help bring new people into the world of DeFi. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/cf7bb6e5-e771-46ee-ac91-cd624e9b29f5.png\"  /></figure><h2>The Cointelegraph Research team</h2><p>Cointelegraph’s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.
