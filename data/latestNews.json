    "description": "Following BlackRock’s official filing of Spot Ethereum with Nasdaq, reports have confirmed that BlackRock’s Ether ETF plan has been confirmed by Nasdaq and is on its way to the US SEC to gain final approval.  BlackRock Ethereum Spot ETF Confirmed American multinational investment company, BlackRock has been making waves in the crypto space after news spread of NASDAQ listing the investment firm’s Ethereum Spot ETF, iShares Ether Trust in Delaware. “BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF confirmed. They just submitted a 19b-4 filing with Nasdaq,” Bloomberg Research Analyst, Jeff Seyffart stated.  Related Reading: Countdown to Chaos: Ethereum Insider To Expose ETH Founders’ Fraud In Weeks While BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF proposal remains to be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the $9 trillion asset management company has placed its focus on Ethereum Spot ETFs while it waits for the SEC’s final decision on Spot Bitcoin ETFs.  The news of the Nasdaq Ethereum ETF filing comes as a major development for BlackRock’s move into the ETF world. Although the investment company remains tight-lipped on the ETH ETF reports flowing through the space, the possibility of an Ether Spot ETF approval could be a sign of the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future.  Many crypto enthusiasts have predicted that the US SEC may continue its efforts to stop the growth of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by declining BlackRock’s Ether Spot ETF filing.  However, in the case the regulatory body does approve the asset management company’s Ethereum Spot ETF, the SEC could be faced with potential contradictions in its decision-making processes. The acceptance of ETH Spot ETFs would stand in stark contrast to the previous disapproval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, the crypto community has been largely positive, as market metrics signal a potential rally for altcoins following BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF confirmation.  A crypto member has stated that the asset management company’s move into Ether Spot ETFs indicates strategic confidence in securing approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF in the future.  ETH Price Skyrockets Following the news of NASDAQ registering BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF, the price of ETH has increased by over 9% and is currently trading at $2,086.92 according to CoinMarketCap.
