Some crypto market observers believe the answer could be hiding within the price action of a frog-themed memecoin.</p><p>In an Oct. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), Onchain Capital co-founder and Crypto Banter host Ran Neuner suggested that memecoin Pepe (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/pepe-price-index\">PEPE</a>) is a strong indicator of overblown crypto market fever. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you want to know when a pull back is coming, just watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$PEPE</a>.

Around the same time Pepe reached its peak, Bitcoin had already begun sliding downward from a just-attained year high. </p><p>Neuner’s theory has been shared by other crypto traders in the past. On Sept. 23, trader AlexRTB told his 60,000 followers that he had begun using Pepe as a reliable metric for impending short-term declines. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$PEPE</a> pump is another indicator of upcoming <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BTC</a> dump. <br><br>I am speaking with experience, you can check past price movements. <br><br>Pumping coins like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$PEPE</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$DOGE</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$XRP</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IMX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IMX</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LINK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$LINK</a> always indicates the bloodbath, let&#39;s see how it goes this time. <a href=\"https://t.co/piseCxRiqD\">pic.twitter.com/piseCxRiqD</a></p>&mdash; Alex RT₿ (@rutradebtc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rutradebtc/status/1705285740156862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>However, the theory also attracts a fair share of skeptics, while the data hasn’t always supported the theory.</p><p>Dubai-based trader Reetika told Cointelegraph that Pepe’s recent uptick was largely driven by bullish news regarding changes in the team and the fact that it would be burning additional tokens, and wasn’t necessarily a sign of broader overconfidence in the market. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.9T <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$PEPE</a> Tokens worth ~$6,000,000 have been burned. <a href=\"https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u\">https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u</a><br><br>A new team of advisors have been brought on to guide Pepe forward.

It has broken out of resistances at least a day before BTC/ETH over this entire move. I've been using it actionably for estimating upside,” she said. </p><p>Reetika however clarified that the SOL isn’t a perfect indicator either, but had performed well on the most recent move.</p><p>Similarly, market commentator and avid crypto shitposter Poordart, told Cointelegraph that Pepe probably isn’t the best metric from which to gauge the future price action of majors like Bitcoin. </p><p>In Poordarts’ view, Pepe is still far too new to the market to have any “real lasting value” as a reliable metric to gauge the price movements of Bitcoin with any significant accuracy. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-zero-knowledge-voting-finance/\"><strong><em>Beyond crypto — Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
