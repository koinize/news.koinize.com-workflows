It is not just about technical feasibility but about actual accessibility for regular users. We need to rise to meet this challenge.”</blockquote><p><strong>Magazine: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/zkrollups-endgame-scaling-blockchains-polygon-miden-founder/\"><strong>ZK-rollups are ‘the endgame’ for scaling blockchains, Polygon Miden founder</strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
