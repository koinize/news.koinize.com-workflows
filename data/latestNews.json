Based on the outcome of the liquidity stress testing, the EBA or, where applicable, the relevant competent authority/supervisor, may decide to strengthen the liquidity requirements of the issuer,” the official proposal read.</blockquote><p>Once approved, the proposal is set to come into effect from June to early next year. After implementing the guidelines, the authorities will have the power to strengthen the liquidity requirements of the relevant issuer to cover those risks based on the outcome of the liquidity stress testing. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-delist-stablecoins-in-europe-mica-compliance\"><strong><em>Binance plans to delist stablecoins in Europe, citing MiCA compliance</em></strong></a></p><p>The proposed liquidity rules are aimed at issuers of stablecoins, which can be non-bank institutions, meet the same safeguards, and avoid unfair capital or liquidity advantages over banks.
