    "description": "Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,520 support against the US dollar. ETH is rising and might rally if it clears the $1,605 resistance. Ethereum averted more losses below the $1,520 support zone. The price is trading above $1,560 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,562 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair is moving higher toward the breakout zone at $1,605. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum managed to stay above the main breakdown support at $1,520. The recent rise in XRP is sparking a recovery wave in the crypto market. ETH managed to start an increase above the $1,550 and $1,565 resistance levels, like Bitcoin. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,562 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,542 low.

A close above the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels might start a steady increase. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, Ether could start a recovery wave toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750. Another Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next key support is $1,540. The main support is still near $1,520. A downside break below the $1,520 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,440 level.
