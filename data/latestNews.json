According to a blog post from IBM, it will be used to conduct research in various fields, including bioinformatics, materials science and finance.</p><p>Per Hiroaki Aihara, executive vice president of the University of Tokyo:</p><blockquote>“For the first time outside North America, a quantum computer with a 127-qubit processor is now available for exclusive use with QII members… By promoting research in a wide range of fields and realizing social implementation of quantum-related technologies, we aim to make a broad contribution to a future society with diversity and hope.”</blockquote><p>While Japan and the University of Tokyo reap the benefits of working with a U.S. quantum computing partner, China’s second-largest technology firm, Alibaba, has decided to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/alibabas-research-arm-shuts-quantum-computing-lab-amid-restructuring-2023-11-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">shutter</a> its own quantum computing laboratory and will reportedly donate its equipment to Zhejiang University.</p><p>Local media reports <a href=\"https://www.donews.com/news/detail/1/3808508.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">indicate</a> the Alibaba move is a cost-cutting measure and that dozens of employees associated with the quantum research lab have been laid off. This follows the cancellation of a planned cloud computing spinoff earlier this month, with Alibaba stating that the partial United States export ban on computer chips to China has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/alibaba-quarterly-revenue-line-with-expectations-2023-11-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">contributed</a> to “uncertainty.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-official-confirms-military-concerns-over-china-access-ai-cloud-technology\"><strong><em>US official confirms military concerns over China’s access to cloud technology</em></strong></a></p><p>The quantum computing sector is expected to <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/quantum-computing-market-104855\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">grow</a> by more than $5.5 billion between 2023 and 2030, according to estimates from Fortune Business Insights.
