So we're still in the fax era of global payments.”</blockquote><p>Marcus explained that a money transfer to non-U.S. residents in this case would involve obtaining their bank account number and walking to the local bank to pay $50 for an international wire.</p><p>“If it's after Friday at 5 pm, tough luck,” Marcus added.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">David Marcus on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bitcoin</a> as base settlement layer for \"Trillions of dollars of transactions\"<a href=\"https://t.co/L21fmiwxyZ\">pic.twitter.com/L21fmiwxyZ</a></p>— Alex Stanczyk ∞/21m (@alexstanczyk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstanczyk/status/1701229828962193704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 11, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Marcus, who co-founded Lightspark in May 2022 and serves as CEO, said his company is now in a race to solve that using the Bitcoin Lightning network. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-25-k-opportunity-or-sign-of-calamity\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-25-k-opportunity-or-sign-of-calamity/amp\"><strong><em>Bitcoin price dips below $25K — Opportunity, or sign of incoming disaster? </em></strong></a></p><p>The former PayPal president however believes that ultimately, Bitcoin Lightning won't be used so much for everyday purchases, and instead be mainly used for overseas transfers. </p><p>“Our view is actually that Bitcoin is not the currency that people will use to buy things.” Instead Bitcoin will be used to send U.S. dollars to someone that ultimately receives it in the form of a Japanese Yen or Euro on the other side of the world, the Lightspark boss explained.</p><p>Marcus said Bitcoin’s settlement layer combined with Lightning’s real-time payments enables cash finality at a very low cost.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/recursive-inscriptions-bitcoin-supercomputer-defi-aws-possible/\"><strong><em>Magazine: Recursive inscriptions — Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "
