    "description": "Litecoin price declined heavily below $80 and $70 against the US Dollar. LTC is attempting a recovery wave but upsides might be limited above $70. Litecoin is correcting losses from the $56 support zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $70 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $66.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could recover above $66 but the bears might remain active near $70. Litecoin Price Starts Recovery This past week, there was a sharp decline in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other altcoins against the US Dollar. LTC price formed a top near $85 before it started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below $80 and $70. The price even declined below $60. It traded as low as $55.78 and recently started an upside correction. There was a minor increase above the $60 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $85.39 swing high to the $55.78 low. Litecoin is now trading below $70 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $66.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $66 zone. The next major resistance is near the $70 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $85.39 swing high to the $55.78 low. If there is a clear break above the $70 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $75 and $78 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $85 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $70 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $63.50 level. The next major support is forming near the $60 level, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $56.00 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $52 support. Technical indicators: 4-hour MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. 4-hour RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is still below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $63.50 followed by $60.00. Major Resistance Levels – $66.00 and $70.00."
