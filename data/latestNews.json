It's not really worth the hassle/compromises. Most of the market is overseas anyways. Innovate there, find PMF [product market fit], then come back with more leverage.”</blockquote><p>“In the grand scheme of things barely anyone uses or cares about crypto today. I personally don’t care about any outcome except growing crypto 100x+ long term,” he added. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is aligned with American values. What could be more American &amp; capitalist than a financial system of the people, by the people, and for the people<br><br>That is literally what we’re building here.

It absolutely is as it takes a really long time (must be ready for the re-entry) and much of the world will follow the US’s lead,” he said, adding that:</p><blockquote>“Crypto not yet having world-scale usage/product market fit means we don’t yet have much influence in policy. We need to have products with massive usage where users (voters) say ‘wait, I need this’.”</blockquote><p>Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — a firm that has made several efforts to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-political-initiative-features-lawmaker-admited-ethics-violations\">help drive crypto policy in the U.S.</a> — responded to the post by offering a different point of view, as he noted that: “I see your point — but I think it will be better in a much shorter time. Probably by next year if I had to guess.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/does-high-us-consumer-debt-benefit-bitcoin-price\"><strong><em>Does high US consumer debt benefit Bitcoin price?</em></strong></a></p><p>“The U.S. always gets it right, after exhausting every other option. It will heal from these wounds, no matter how hard a small group of people try to stop progress,” Armstrong said. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m optimistic! And we’re helping our small part with policy too<br><br>I just think it’s different for startups vs scaled businesses.
