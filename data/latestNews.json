    "description": "<p>Road Town, British Virgin Islands, June 22nd, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Labs, a renowned venture fund specializing in blockchain and cryptocurrency investments, is thrilled to announce its recent investment in Furion, a groundbreaking non-custodial and permissionless NFT utility platform. </p><p>Furion addresses a significant challenge in the NFT ecosystem, where non-fungible tokens often suffer from low utilization and limited liquidity. Furion enables the fractionalization of NFTs into corresponding ERC20 tokens. These tokens can be freely traded and farmed on the Furion platform, opening up a world of financial possibilities such as borrowing, lending, and long and short positions.</p><p>Other technical strengths of Furion's platform include the transformation of NFTs into fungible tokens through smart contracts. This enables collateralized lending between NFTs and mainstream ERC-20 tokens, leveraging peer-to-pool (P2P) operations and calculation logic. By adopting this approach, Furion significantly increases the capital utilization rate of collateral while reducing the risk exposure for lenders through the spread of collateral volatility.</p><p>Additionally, Furion's integration of an automated market maker (AMM) trading pool enhances liquidation efficiency, ensuring smooth and efficient trading experiences for users. Moreover, the platform enables short selling of NFTs, allowing users to borrow NFT assets by staking stablecoins, selling them at the current market price, and repurchasing them at a lower price to close their positions and make a profit if the NFT asset price falls.</p><p>The investment of crypto exchange LBank&rsquo;s venture fund in Furion comes at a time when the NFT market is undergoing rapid growth, with various NFT projects emerging. Recognizing the long-term potential and swift adoption of NFTs, LBank Labs is committed to supporting innovative solutions that contribute to the growth and maturation of the NFT market economy and infrastructure.</p><p>With $100 million in assets under management, LBank Labs brings financial resources and a global network to Furion. In return, Furion will provide value to Labs, leveraging their expertise and strategic insights for mutual growth. &ldquo;The dynamic and passionate team of Furion brings a wealth of experience and research in the NFT finance domain. Through our interactions with the Furion project team, we gained a deep understanding of the homogenized fragment NFT Pool solution, and how it sparks new possibilities in the NFT market&rdquo;, said Wilson, Investment Asian Lead at LBank Labs.</p><p>Furion aligns seamlessly with Labs' distinct investing thesis, the \"Platform, Standard, Ecosystem\" proposition. This novel strategy breaks away from the conventional divisions in the blockchain industry, transcending the traditional views of technology-centric paradigms or sector-based categorizations. Furion's NFT platform, characterized by its point-to-pool mortgage lending model and token fragmentation, perfectly embodies the platform aspect of Labs' thesis. Additionally, Furion has the potential to become an industry standard, fulfilling the fundamental component of Labs' investment proposition. Finally, Furion's robust ecosystem of companies, developers, and engaged user communities exemplifies the ecosystem element that Labs seeks in its investments. On the ecosystem level, Furion has already established a healthy ecosystem, including associated companies, developers, and user communities. Furion actively engages with the global NFT community and promptly adjusts its products based on valuable feedback from the community. With its unique positioning in the NFT financialization space, Furion emerges as an ideal investment for Labs, aligning with their visionary investment approach and defying traditional categorizations within the blockchain industry.</p><p>The venture fund also aims to strengthen its commitment by building a comprehensive network of Fund of Funds to enhance portfolio performance and diversification. LBank Labs operates in seven global regions, fostering collaboration and innovation across borders.</p><p>About LBank</p><p>LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015. It offers specialized financial derivatives, expert asset management services, and safe crypto trading to its users. The platform holds over 9 million users from more than 210 regions across the world. LBank is a cutting-edge growing platform that ensures the integrity of users&rsquo; funds and aims to contribute to the global adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Community &amp; Social Media:&nbsp;l&nbsp;Telegram&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;LinkedIn&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;YouTube</p>ContactGlobal PR DirectorJeremy Van der HaegenLBankpress@lbank.info"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-market-sees-liquidations-amid-bitcoins-leap/",
    "description": "A few hours after Bitcoin scaled the $30,000 mark, the global crypto market has been rocked by substantial liquidations. The past 24 hours alone have seen a drastic exodus of more than $260 million from the crypto market. This significant upheaval underlines the high-stakes, volatile nature of digital currency trading. Notably, traders currently at a loss despite the uptrend in the market are those that took short positions with the hope of the crypto market continuing a downward trend. Sweeping Liquidation Wave Hits Crypto Traders Data from Coinglass reveals that an estimated 65,392 traders and counting had their positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, amounting to cumulative losses above $269 million. This event underscores the risk in crypto trading, particularly during significant market shifts, such as Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge beyond the $30,000 threshold. Binance, a prominent player in the crypto exchange arena, accounted for the most significant slice of these liquidations, totaling $84.79 million. Other exchanges, including OKX with $69.53 million, Bybit with $37.9 million, and Huobi with $32.35 million, also recorded large liquidations. While smaller exchanges also saw liquidations, their impact on the overall market was less severe. Notably, The liquidation wave impacted traders mainly holding short positions, reflecting the majority&#8217;s anticipation of a price decrease. These traders bore the brunt of the liquidations, accounting for approximately 80.9% ($218.21 million). Simultaneously, traders holding long positions were not immune to the market&#8217;s volatility, with liquidations amounting to nearly 20% of the total ($51.50 million). This underscores that fluctuations in the crypto market can be equally detrimental to both ends of the trading spectrum. A stark illustration of this explosive situation came from Bitmex, where a single trader recorded a massive loss of $9.30 million in an XBTUSD swap, the largest single liquidation in this episode. Bitcoin Latest Price Action Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has made significant moves. The asset has briefly tapped a notable high of above $30,000 a few minutes ago from writing. This surge comes after the asset&#8217;s previous blood bath amid the intensified regulatory scrutiny on the largest crypto exchanges that saw its price trade below $25,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $29,991 after briefly climbing above $30,000. Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization saw a boost of 15.7%, amounting to an additional $80 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $583.6 billion, an increase from last Wednesday’s $503 billion. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has also surged from a low of around $7 billion last week to as high as above $30 billion in the past 24 hours. This update suggests an increased trading activity of Bitcoin within a span of 7 days.  Furthermore, Bitcoin liquidations formed a significant chunk of this turbulence, accounting for $115.76 million. Following Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) traders witnessed liquidations of $51.94 million, reaffirming the ripple effect across different cryptocurrencies.
