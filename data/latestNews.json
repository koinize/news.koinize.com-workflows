    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/near-3-reasons-this-crypto-is-up-80-while-others-hibernate-in-the-run-up-to-2024/",
    "description": "In the prevailing bearish backdrop of the broader cryptocurrency market, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) emerges as a noteworthy exception, showcasing remarkable resilience and defying the prevailing downtrend. Its trajectory has been one of sustained upward momentum, a trend that notably took root around mid-December and has continued to gather strength. Unlike the general market sentiment characterized by a downturn, NEAR has not only weathered the storm but has surged impressively. Over the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant 80% increase in value, a feat that has not gone unnoticed by market participants and enthusiasts alike. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Climbs 12% On Christmas Day – Brewing Bull Run Or False Dawn? This surge has effectively propelled NEAR to double its base value, which stood at $4.24, signaling a robust and impressive performance in contrast to the prevailing market conditions. Here are three reasons why this token is thawing in the run-up to 2024: NEAR: Technical Resilience NEAR&#8217;s upward trajectory is not a mere coincidence but is supported by robust technical indicators. A decisive price breakout on December 21st shattered a crucial resistance level at $4.0, paving the way for sustained growth. This breakout generated warmth for further price appreciation. Furthermore, an ascending trendline, currently positioned at $3.7, acts as a reliable support against potential downward movements. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 40% signals potential buyer exhaustion but also indicates a healthy correction for long-term bullishness, portraying an enduring technical strength that is not easily extinguished. NEAR market cap currently at $4.292 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Community Momentum NEAR&#8217;s success is not a solitary achievement; it is a result of a thriving community. The trading volume has surged impressively by 170% over the past week, reaching over $410 million on December 25th alone. This surge in trading activity underscores the growing investor confidence. Open Interest (OI), representing future buying potential, has also surpassed $140 million, reflecting a shared optimism that NEAR&#8217;s flame is burning bright. Source: CoinAlyze This fervent belief adds fuel to the fire, attracting a considerable number of new participants—over 48,000 in the past week—drawn to the warmth of the NEAR ecosystem. Future Roadmap Looking ahead, NEAR&#8217;s future appears ablaze with ambitious plans outlined in its 2024 development roadmap. These plans include high-speed transactions exceeding 100,000 per second, enhanced scalability to eliminate bottlenecks, and the introduction of innovative dApps like Nightshade 2.0, promising enhanced privacy and security. Related Reading: XRP In December 2023: Decoding An 800% Nostalgia And The Hope For $1 These developments solidify NEAR&#8217;s position as a frontrunner in the crypto space, leaving competitors in the shadows and envying its progress. NEAR&#8217;s ability to withstand the challenges of the current market makes it a beacon of hope for investors seeking both warmth and growth. As market conditions gradually improve, NEAR is poised to breach the $5 barrier, representing a potential 30% increase from its current price. This outlook is likely to attract those yearning to escape the chill of the crypto winter, further cementing NEAR&#8217;s position as a noteworthy player in the evolving crypto landscape.
