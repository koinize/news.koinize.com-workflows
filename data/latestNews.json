Its price has risen to $36, placing it in the top 10 digital assets in terms of market capitalization. AVAX prices have been trending higher, which has helped many holders realize gains.

Notably, it has also propelled the altcoin past its initial lower high, which happened in August 2022 during the bear market&#8217;s accumulation phase. For almost three weeks, the price of Avalanche token fluctuated within a narrow range of $20 to $24, suggesting a lack of strong buying and selling pressure in the market. AVAXUSD currently trading at $36. Chart: TradingView.com AVAX recently gained traction and had a 15% gain; as a result, the price broke through its important resistance level. The coin saw another 15% surge when the price was hovering at its resistance level of $28. Many causes, all closely related to major developments in its ecology, are responsible for Avalanche&#8217;s steady climb.
