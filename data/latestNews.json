    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/coinbase/bitcoin-etfs-boosts-coinbase-coin-shares-as-jpmorgan-upgrades-rating/",
    "description": "The recent Bitcoin rally, propelling its price to the $52,000 level, has positively impacted the stock of US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN). After experiencing a notable dip to $115 at the start of February, Coinbase&#8217;s stock rose to $172 on Thursday, following a significant upgrade by a JPMorgan analyst. Improved Prospects For Coinbase Amid Crypto Rally According to a Bloomberg report, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington abandoned his bearish view on Coinbase weeks after downgrading the stock.  As Bitcoin traded higher, Coinbase shares gained as much as 7.8% following the upgrade. Worthington believes the exchange will likely benefit from the recent rally in digital asset prices, prompting him to shift his rating back to neutral. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction – DOGE Pump To $0.12 Seems Imminent This change in stance comes after Worthington&#8217;s January downgrade, where he predicted a potential deflation of enthusiasm for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  However, contrary to his previous forecast, Bitcoin ETFs have been successful in terms of trading measures, and the price of Bitcoin has surged beyond $52,000, reaching its highest level since 2021. In a note to clients on Thursday, Worthington explained: Given the acceleration in recent days of flows into Bitcoin ETFs and the significant price appreciation of Bitcoin and now Ethereum, we are returning to a Neutral rating on Coinbase as we see the higher cryptocurrency prices not only sustaining but improving activity levels and Coinbase&#8217;s earnings power as we look to 1Q24. Coinbase&#8217;s stock experienced an 8% dip at the beginning of the year, following an impressive 400% surge in 2023. Analyst opinions on the stock remain divided, with buy, hold, and sell recommendations being roughly evenly split.  Worthington maintained his $80 price target on the stock ahead of the company&#8217;s earnings report, which is scheduled to be released after the market closes on Thursday. Worthington emphasized that Coinbase&#8217;s business is closely tied to token prices, with its core revenue being transaction-based. As the value of tokens increases and trading activity gains momentum, fees based on the value traded are expected to drive higher trading volumes, ultimately contributing to improved revenue for Coinbase. Bitcoin ETFs Witness Significant Trading Volume  On February 14th, the trading volume of Bitcoin ETFs showcased notable figures, with Blackrock’s IBIT recording the lead with $721 million in volume.  Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed closely with $619 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC secured the third spot with $456 million. On the other hand, Ark Invest accumulated a volume of $169 million. The nine ETFs&#8217; total trading volume amounted to approximately $1.5 billion. Notably, the largest ETFs experienced higher trading volume than the previous day, with IBIT surpassing $700 million and GBTC exceeding $600 million. Intriguingly, before the trading session, GBTC sent less than half of the Bitcoin it sent to Coinbase the previous day. Despite this decrease, GBTC&#8217;s total trading volume was 50% higher.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-all-time-high-ahead-historical-pattern-signals-50-chance-of-reaching-100k-by-august/",
    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, has surged to a 26-month high, reaching $52,000 and reigniting predictions of surpassing its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000.  The market has experienced a resurgence of bullish sentiments, fueled further by the recent adoption of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These have spurred notable growth within just one month of approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Poised For A Major Breakout?  Investment manager and market expert Timothy Peterson, who recently made a bold claim on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), reinforces Bitcoin&#8217;s renewed optimism.  Peterson stated that Bitcoin had achieved an almost exact 100% gain in 180 days, a feat that has occurred 41 times since 2015. In 78% of these instances, Bitcoin reached even higher price levels.  Furthermore, Peterson&#8217;s analysis of historical data suggests that the average return for the next 180 days after such a gain was also approximately 100%.Based on this historical pattern, Peterson asserts that there is a 50% chance Bitcoin will reach the significant milestone of $100,000 by August.  Related Reading: $400 XRP Price Point: Analyst Breaks Down The Future Surge Date However, despite this possibility, as the halving event approaches, there could be another correction that, while not putting the bull run in jeopardy, could trigger significant liquidation rates as the hype surrounding the current uptrend mounts. Pre-Halving Correction Looms The upcoming halving event scheduled for April, combined with historical patterns, suggests that Bitcoin may experience one final correction before the bull run resumes, presenting a crucial moment for investors. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasizes the significance of a pre-halving retrace, noting that historically, it tends to occur only a few weeks before the actual halving event.  Looking back at previous halvings, such retracements have ranged from -38% in 2016 to -20% in 2020. Based on these patterns, a retracement of around 27% is possible in the current market scenario. If a retracement of this magnitude were to occur, it would place the Bitcoin price at approximately $37,900, as indicated in Rekt Capital&#8217;s pre-halving retrace chart. This level represents an important threshold for investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency before the next phase of the halving event and the anticipated bull run rally. Key Resistance For BTC&#8217;s Trajectory Bitcoin&#8217;s continued rise has brought its price to a critical juncture, with the current trading level of $52,100 catching the attention of the founders of blockchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode. According to their analysis, historical data reveals that the $52,000 level has acted as a formidable resistance point on the weekly chart, making it a crucial threshold for Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory.  The platform&#8217;s founders suggest that a successful breach of this level could trigger a surge of buying pressure, potentially leading to a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) scenario among investors. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Stuns: Price Soars Over 60% In Epic Recovery As TVL Explodes Overall, the future direction of BTC price remains uncertain, leaving investors to ponder whether the current uptrend will be sustained or if a potential pre-halving retrace will occur before resuming its upward trajectory to surpass its previous all-time high and reach the coveted $100,000 level.

This trend, primarily focusing on strikes above $60,000, signals a &#8216;robust&#8217; confidence among traders in Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for further gains.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-money-laundering-plummets-by-29-in-latest-chainalysis-findings/",
    "description": "According to a recent report published by crypto analytics firm Chainalysis, money laundering involving crypto assets has experienced a notable decline compared to the previous year. However, the report highlights that illicit actors have started adapting their tactics to evade detection and further obscure the movement of illicit funds.  Evolving Tactics In Crypto Money Laundering According to the report, illicit addresses sent approximately $22.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency to various services in 2023, a significant decrease from the $31.5 billion sent in 2022.  While part of this decline can be attributed to an overall decrease in legitimate and illicit crypto transaction volume, the report reveals that money laundering activity witnessed a steeper drop of 29.5%, compared to the 14.9% decrease in total transaction volume. Related Reading: XRP Price Alert: Breakout Could Confirm Today Centralized exchanges remain the primary destination for funds originating from illicit addresses, with this trend remaining relatively stable over the past five years. However, the report indicates a shift in the distribution of illicit funds, with a growing share being directed towards decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Chainalysis suggests that this can be attributed to DeFi&#8217;s overall expansion during the same period, although the transparent nature of DeFi platforms makes them less favorable for obfuscating fund movements. While the breakdown of service types used for money laundering in 2023 resembled that of the previous year, there were noticeable changes in specific types of crypto criminals&#8217; money laundering practices.  The report highlights a significant increase in the volume of funds sent to cross-chain bridges from addresses associated with stolen funds, indicating a shift towards utilizing bridge protocols for money laundering purposes. Additionally, there was a substantial rise in funds sent from ransomware attacks to gambling platforms and bridges, showcasing the “adaptability and resourcefulness” of cybercriminals. North Korean Hackers And Cross-Chain Bridges The concentration of money laundering at fiat off-ramps, where criminals convert their crypto into cash, remains a significant concern. While thousands of off-ramping services operate, most money laundering activity is concentrated in a few services.  In 2023, 71.7% of illicit funds sent to off-ramping services went to just five services, a slight increase from 68.7% in 2022. The report also reveals an increase in deposit addresses receiving large sums of illicit cryptocurrency, indicating a more diversified approach by criminals to evade detection and mitigate the impact of frozen accounts. Furthermore, the report highlights the changing tactics of “sophisticated” crypto criminals, particularly in the case of North Korean-affiliated hacking groups like Lazarus Group.  According to Chainalysis, these actors have demonstrated an ability to adapt their money laundering strategies in response to law enforcement actions. The report cites the shutdown of mixer services, such as Sinbad, and the subsequent rise of replacements like YoMix, which has become a preferred mixer for North Korea-affiliated hackers. Moreover, cross-chain bridges have seen substantial growth in money laundering activities, with illicit actors leveraging these protocols to move funds between blockchains. North Korean hackers, in particular, have been prominent users of bridge protocols for money laundering purposes.  Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rise To $52,000 Masks Potential Pitfalls Ahead, Analyst Warns Ultimately, the report emphasizes the need for increased diligence and understanding of “interconnectedness” in fighting crypto crime by targeting money laundering infrastructure.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

So far, the flagship cryptocurrency has recently broken through the $52,000 mark and traded above it for the first time since December 2021. However, Spot On Chain reveals that Bitcoin faces potential challenges that could affect its immediate market performance. Two significant sell-off events loom on the horizon, potentially influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s price dynamics in the short term. These developments have sparked speculation, prompting a closer examination of their possible impacts on the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rise To $52,000 Masks Potential Pitfalls Ahead, Analyst Warns Major Bitcoin Sell-Off Events On The Horizon The first of these events involves Genesis, a prominent crypto asset manager authorized to offload a significant portion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares. The second event is marked by the US government&#8217;s announcement to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings acquired from the Silk Road platform. Genesis has received approval to sell 35 million GBTC shares, estimated to be worth around $1.3 billion. This occurrence mirrors an earlier liquidation event involving FTX, which notably impacted Bitcoin&#8217;s market price, illustrating the potential volatility such moves can introduce.

With the government holding one of the largest Bitcoin reserves globally, its actions have a marked influence on market perceptions and the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price stability.

The TD Sequential has two phases. The first is called the &#8220;setup&#8221; and lasts nine candles. Once nine candles (of the same polarity) are in, the setup completes, and the indicator signals a likely reversal for the price.

If these candles were green, the indicator would imply a top for the asset, while red candles would suggest a bottom. When the setup finishes, the &#8220;countdown&#8221; phase begins. In this phase, candles of the same type are counted again, except for thirteen. Once the countdown also completes, another potential reversal could be assumed to have occurred for the price. Recently, Bitcoin has finished a TD Sequential phase of the former type. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern forming in the daily price of the cryptocurrency: The TD Sequential setup that has just completed for BTC &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the TD Sequential setup has recently finished with green candles for Bitcoin. These green candles have come for the coin as it has enjoyed some sharp bullish momentum, which has taken its price beyond the $52,000 mark. The fact that the TD Sequential setup has formed with green candles suggests the indicator may now be providing a sell signal for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. In the same chart, Ali highlighted the previous instances since December of last year where a setup was completed for the asset. It would appear that both TD Sequential buy and sell signals have held for the coin in this window. Related Reading: Extreme Greed Is Back For Bitcoin, Is It Time To Sell? Going by this pattern, the latest TD Sequential reversal signal might also hold for the asset. And as it&#8217;s a bearish one this time, the analyst expects a correction lasting for one to four daily candlesticks. BTC Price Bitcoin&#8217;s recent momentum has meant that the asset has been among the best performers in the sector, registering growth of around 16% during the past week. Currently, the coin is hovering around the $52,500 level. The chart below shows the asset&#8217;s trajectory over the last month. The price of the coin seems to have been sharply going up recently &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap/uniswap-v4-catalyst-uni-token-primed-for-growth-as-new-chain-launch-loom/",
    "description": "Uniswap, one of the world&#8217;s largest decentralized exchanges (DEX), is poised for significant growth with the upcoming launch of its V4 upgrade. This anticipated update will introduce custom Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality directly on top of Uniswap, eliminating the need for separate AMM designs. In addition, Uniswap&#8217;s governance token, UNI, has seen notable growth, with a 6.8% increase in the last 24 hours and an 8% increase in the previous 30 days, bringing the UNI token to $7.318. However, while these developments favor the exchange and investors, decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DeFi Ignas has raised concerns regarding the launch and its potential impact on critical features. The Ultimate DeFi Liquidity Solution With Uniswap V4? According to DeFi Ignas’ latest analysis on X (formerly Twitter), Uniswap V4 represents a significant transformation from a protocol to a platform. Like the Apple Store&#8217;s impact on the iPhone, Uniswap V4 will consolidate all pools into a single framework, reducing creation costs by 99% and enabling more cost-effective multi-pool swaps. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rise To $52,000 Masks Potential Pitfalls Ahead, Analyst Warns The introduction of the &#8220;Hooks&#8221; system is particularly noteworthy. These hooks act as plugins or extensions, allowing for customized code execution during crucial events within a pool.  The 13 available hooks enable various functionalities, including on-chain limit orders, time-weighted average market making, liquidity depositing into lending protocols, auto compound liquidity provider (LP) fees, and know-your-customer (KYC) integration. Introducing hooks leads DeFi Ignas to believe that the launch of Uniswap V4 will allow developers to experiment and launch their protocols while leveraging Uniswap&#8217;s liquidity. According to the researcher, this has the potential to attract even more liquidity from other decentralized exchanges and establish Uniswap as the dominant liquidity layer for all DeFi activities, from trading to lending. Yet, while unified liquidity may benefit users by increasing market efficiency, it raises concerns about potential market concentration and stifling of competition. UNI Token Gains Momentum Uniswap&#8217;s V4 liquidity sourcing could concentrate liquidity within the platform, potentially making it the go-to liquidity layer for DeFi. According to DeFi Ignas, this dominance, coupled with Uniswap&#8217;s operating license that prohibits forking until 2027, raises questions about market competition and the potential impact on decentralized finance.  In addition, reports suggest that Uniswap Labs has sent takedown notices to gateways of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) &#8211; a decentralized and distributed protocol designed to facilitate the storage and sharing of files on a peer-to-peer network &#8211; adding another layer of concern about decentralized access and censorship resistance. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Stuns: Price Soars Over 60% In Epic Recovery As TVL Explodes Regarding the potential upside of Uniswap V4 acting as a catalyst for the exchange&#8217;s token, the research went on to suggest that while UNI’s value &#8220;accrual&#8221; for retail investors has been relatively modest, the introduction of Uniswap V4 and its hooks opens up new possibilities. In this sense, DeFi Ignas believes the UNI token could function as a platform/ecosystem token, benefiting from third-party decentralized applications (dApps) developed using Uniswap&#8217;s hooks, expanding the token&#8217;s use cases and potentially attracting more investors. Additionally, there is speculation that Uniswap may solidify its dominance and liquidity by launching its chain, potentially as a layer-two (L2) solution, which could further boost the valuation of the UNI token. As the upgrade deadline for Uniswap approaches, the impact of the exchange&#8217;s upgrade on the UNI token remains uncertain. However, there has been a noticeable growth in the token&#8217;s value over the past few weeks.  After reaching a 17-month high of $8.260 in January, the token experienced a correction but has since broken out of that pattern. As the upgrade deadline draws near, it is yet to be determined whether the token can consolidate its gains and regain previous levels. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
