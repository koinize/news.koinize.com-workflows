The collaborative nature of digital art/collectibles and the ability to layer utility on top is too big of a value proposition for sports administrators and athletes alike to ignore. </p><p>The future will start with digital first. Scalability and accessibility are huge drivers for sports that command a global audience. As NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last week at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBATopShot/status/1677842179228827649?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >NBA Con</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Because our buildings are essentially full, we cant scale our arenas, 99.9-something of our fans only experience the NBA through our media. Through technology, how can we extend beyond that  products like NBA Top Shot are ways to do it. </p></blockquote><h2 id=\"h-us-women-s-golf-open-artball\">US Womens Golf Open ArtBall</h2><p>Last week, golf followed in the footsteps of the Australian Open tennis grand slams <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/zombies-nfts-and-the-metaverse-galaxy-digitals-sam-englebardt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >NFT</a> project the <a href=\"https://ao-2023.artball.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >AO ArtBall</a>, rolling out a similar concept for the <a href=\"https://usga.artball.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >US Womens Open</a>. Using the same name ArtBall the USGA teamed up with some of the same architects on the project, which ties a piece of the surface area of the sports field to an NFT.</p><p>More than 3000 people minted an NFT for free that correlated with a plot of the 17th green at host course Pebble Beach. In the tennis version a match point landing on your area saw your <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/zombies-nfts-and-the-metaverse-galaxy-digitals-sam-englebardt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >NFT</a> upgraded, but the US Womens Open opted for a variety of ways to provide upgradable traits including landing points, closest to the hole and longest hole out. More <a href=\"https://assets.artball.io/usga/uswo23-litepaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >here</a> on how the mechanics worked.</p><p>The ArtBall concept is a strong one where we see the integration of existing highly sophisticated sports data tracking technology and a new way to engage with fans by blurring the lines between physical and digital experiences. </p><p>Kudos to artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amygoodchild\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Amy Goodchild</a> who spearheaded the generative art on the golf balls. They look very clean and crisp. This is another example of sport and art blending together via NFTs.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Womens-Golf-NFT-Project-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"US Women's Golf\" class=\"wp-image-21995\" width=\"936\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Womens-Golf-NFT-Project-Large.jpeg 1010w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Womens-Golf-NFT-Project-Large-300x133.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Womens-Golf-NFT-Project-Large-770x342.jpeg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Examples of the official ArtBall from the 2023 US Womens Open.

I don’t want people to feel a particular emotion when engaging with it, rather I hope it forces them to look into a deep place within themselves and get out feelings that were always there. </p><p>I also hope that the people who have dealt with mental disorders feel better about their differences by sharing these experiences.</p><p><strong>tjos style and influences</strong></p><p>With a background in physical paintings and photography, tjo, like many other artists minting works on the blockchain doesnt like to be pigeon holded as a particular type of artist. </p><p>I don’t particularly appreciate how we discuss style in markets like NFTs. It is weaponized as a vehicle for speculation without regard to historical context. If forced to pin down my art into a category, I would fall under mixed media. It is straightforward; I mix a variety of mediums and approaches, both digital and physical, says tjo. </p><p>Greek mythology and anime are two big influences on his work. </p><p>I get more and more influenced by Greek mythology.

It also dictates the position of that word in the seed phrase.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-entered-a-civil-war-over-art\"><strong><em>Bitcoin has entered a civil war — Over ‘art’</em></strong></a></p><p>“The colors are generated in such a way that they carry part of the information of the position occupied by the BIP39 words and information related to their position,” he explained.</p><p>This allows for the phrase to be backed up “in a disorderly way and in several different places,” and as “colors are everywhere,” it can make storing a seed phrase “less obvious to any hacker or thief who gains access to our house or computer.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/082fce09-8178-477d-8a26-7ff0f775c447.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>AI-generated image depicting what artwork designed using Positivo’s tool could look like.

Rather it should be downloaded and used offline, or better yet, the color swatch can even be <a href=\"https://github.com/enteropositivo/bip39colors/tree/main/manual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">created</a> manually using a calculator.</p><p>Though it happens infrequently, crypto users have had their entire seed phrases exposed publicly before.</p><p>In a viral video in late 2022, a Nevada police officer’s body camera footage inadvertently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/police-body-cam-leaks-suspect-s-seed-phrase-during-vehicle-inspection\">caught a glimpse</a> of a suspect’s seed phrase written on a slip of paper.
