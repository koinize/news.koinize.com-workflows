Belcher explained that storing files in space is challenging because factors like radiation could corrupt the files. With a decentralized protocol, Belcher believes this wouldn’t be a problem as the files will be pulled from anywhere. “You can have lots of copies. And if one file gets corrupted, it doesn’t matter.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/thankyoux-sothebys-career-literally-blasts-into-space-nft-creator/\"><strong><em>ThankYouX hits Sotheby’s as his career *literally* blasts into space: NFT Creator</em></strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/filecoin-foundation-space-decentralized-storage-system\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
