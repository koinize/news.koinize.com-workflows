    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-climbs-12-on-christmas-day-brewing-bull-run-or-false-dawn/",
    "description": "The Shiba Inu faithful have reason to wag their tails. Over the past few days, the meme coin has witnessed a surge in buying pressure, hinting at a potential bull run. But should investors unleash their inner Doge and start digging for bones, or is this just a fleeting frenzy? Crypto analyst Ali underscores a noteworthy development in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem—a massive 8 trillion token exodus from exchanges since November. This signals investors&#8217; inclination to retain SHIB in private wallets, reducing selling pressure and potentially paving the way for price appreciation. Related Reading: XRP In December 2023: Decoding An 800% Nostalgia And The Hope For $1 This strategic move reflects a growing confidence in SHIB&#8217;s long-term prospects, creating an environment where the diminished circulating supply may contribute to significant market movements and capitalize on the anticipated bullish momentum. #ShibaInu &#124; Since November, there&#8217;s been a massive withdrawal of over 8 trillion $SHIB from known #crypto exchange wallets – that&#8217;s valued at approximately $88 million! pic.twitter.com/RLFA8N0dLI — Ali (@ali_charts) December 24, 2023 Further fueling the fire is the unwavering loyalty of the &#8220;shrimp and fish,&#8221; small-time investors steadily accumulating SHIB. Their growing numbers are reflected in the rising number of addresses holding modest amounts of the coin. But a closer look reveals cracks in the bullish facade. Metrics like the MACD hint at a possible bearish crossover, suggesting a potential pullback. And while social buzz remains high, technical indicators like RSI and MFI hint at some choppy waters ahead. NewsBTC also examined Santiment&#8217;s statistics. According to our research, the Supply on Exchanges for SHIB dropped sharply last month, even if its price rose. Source: Santiment Adding to the uncertainty is the recent price rally, which could simply be a natural correction after a sharp dip. Investors should remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns, and chasing momentum can be a recipe for disaster. So, where does this leave us? While the recent buying spree and reduced exchange reserves are undoubtedly positive developments, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should keep a close eye on technical indicators and market sentiment before diving headfirst into the SHIB whirlpool. SHIB market cap currently at $6.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Here are some key takeaways: Reduced exchange supply: A positive sign, indicating less selling pressure. Strong retail interest: Shrimp and fish are accumulating, boosting long-term prospects. Technical indicators mixed: Potential for a pullback before further gains. Beware of chasing momentum: Don&#8217;t be swept away by hype.

Its market cap rose to 16th place thanks to a 32% rise in value over the last month. That Shiba Inu had come back from a long-term downturn was also clear. As Shiba Inu marks a solid climb on Christmas Day, the crypto landscape is left to ponder whether this surge is the herald of a brewing bull run or a fleeting false dawn. Featured image from Freepik"
