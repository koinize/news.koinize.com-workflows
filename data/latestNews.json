    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-flips-bnb-ethereum/",
    "description": "Solana has had one of the best price journeys this year, increasing an outstanding 665% since January. The cryptocurrency has particularly done well in the last quarter of the year, registering price gains that were practically absent for the majority of the year.  This week, SOL flipped BNB to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency and second-largest altcoin by market cap. At this rate, Ethereum’s spot may be next. Solana&#8217;s Impressive Growth Solana’s price movement this year has been nothing but surprising, and it has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. At the same time, Solana&#8217;s blockchain has grown in different metrics. The growth can also be simultaneously linked to various airdrops in Solana-based projects and the Solana Saga Phone which gave out 30 million BONK tokens, a Solana meme coin, for each new owner of the phone. As a result, Solana overtook XRP in market cap rankings for the first time ever, with the latter having a 1.82% price decrease in a 7-day timeframe. Related Reading: Renewed Hope For Crypto: 2023 Sets The Stage For A Monumental 2024 Solana&#8217;s native token, SOL, recently reached a yearly high of $99, helping the network to also briefly overtake BNB in terms of market cap. According to data from Coinmarketcap, SOL’s 24-hour trading volume increased by over 33% to over $5.86 billion.  However, Solana has since undergone a price correction and is now trading at $91. On the other hand, BNB&#8217;s price growth has been slow this year, with the crypto only registering a 9% gain in the past 365 days.  At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $269, a 22.7% decrease from its yearly high of $348. Solana is now at loggerheads with BNB and it is only a matter of time until it fully overtakes and claims the position of the 2nd largest altcoin. SOL price recovers above $93 &#124; Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Can Solana Catch Up With Ethereum? The question now is whether Solana can catch up to Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network. While Ethereum still dominates in the DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts space, Solana is continuing to acquire a growing share of the industry.

According to on-chain analytics platform Artemis, total SOL trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours, its highest so far this year. Source: Artemis Solana is currently trading at $91, up by 17% in the past seven days, and is on its way to breaking the $100 price level again. If the current pace of price growth continues, we could see Solana revisiting its current all-time high of $259 in the first half of 2024. However, Solana still has a long way to go to match Ethereum’s network effects and price. Ethereum&#8217;s total market cap currently stands at $278.3 billion, $244 billion more than Solana&#8217;s $39.4 billion market cap.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-crashes-15-after-a-solid-month-is-the-success-story-ending/",
    "description": "BONK has encountered a challenging period following its recent peak at an all-time high of $0.00003, which occurred just this past Wednesday. Since reaching this pinnacle, the price has undergone a significant decline, plummeting by more than 50%. This notable downturn has raised concerns within the market, emphasizing the urgency for buyers to re-enter the scene promptly. The next moves by buyers will play a pivotal role in determining the trajectory of BONK&#8217;s price action. BONK: Meme Coin&#8217;s Price Rollercoaster Ride At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.000018, down 29% in the last 24 hours, and sustained a significant loss of 30.6 in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This AI Altcoin Will Hit A Fresh ATH After 300% Rally Latest BONK data mirrors a substantial price surge, drawing parallels to the remarkable and sometimes notorious ascents witnessed in other meme coins, such as Shiba Inu. Yet, the chart now reveals the initiation of a descending pattern, with the emergence of red candles signaling a sell-off phase and hinting at the potential conclusion of the BONK narrative. The evolving chart dynamics raise questions about the sustainability of BONK&#8217;s earlier success and introduce an air of uncertainty into its once-bullish trajectory. BONKUSD currently trading at $0.0000190336 territory. Chart: TradingView.com This week, Binance announced a notable expansion of BONK trading on its platform by introducing it to Binance Margin. This strategic move followed the earlier listing of BONK on the exchange with three additional pairs, a decision fueled by substantial demand for the meme coin. The introduction of BONK to Binance Margin fueled speculation within the crypto community, with expectations of a potential price boost for the meme coin. However, the unfolding events took an unexpected turn, diverging from the anticipated trajectory. Despite initial speculations, the market dynamics surrounding BONK underwent a different outcome, introducing a layer of unpredictability to its trading journey. BONK seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko As the price approaches the $0.000018 support level once again, the direction that BONK is moving in appears to be bearish. If it starts to decrease, it can soon reach the $0.000014 barrier. RSI Decline Raises Concerns For BONK The RSI on the three-day timeframe has been falling rapidly, going from 98 points in early December to 78 points today as the purchasing momentum has faded and the sell volume is increasing. Remaining bullish would be difficult if this kept up. The chart&#8217;s high volatility, which is seen in its large price swings and suggests a struggle between buyers and sellers, is another important component. The market may be losing the sharp rising trend that typified previous rises as the Moving Averages (MAs) begin to flatten out. Source: CoinCodex Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Hits New ATH At $44 – Is $50 Next This Christmas? According to CoinCodex technical indicators, the current sentiment is bullish despite the depressing numbers for BONK, and the Fear &#38; Greed Index is currently displaying 74 (Greed). As for the meme coin, the current price projection indicates a decline to the $ 0.000021 level by December 27, 2023, or a loss of 2.39%. Despite an initially enchanting journey, BONK&#8217;s narrative now suggests a fading magic, leaving investors with another dog-themed asset lacking a clear use case. The coin&#8217;s future appears to be navigating a cycle where exuberant explosions are followed by significant corrections, echoing the market&#8217;s sobering from speculative fervor.
