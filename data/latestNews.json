In the chief's view, incorporating virtual assets providers into the regulatory system was the only way to embrace innovation and strengthen market trust after FTX bankruptcy. </p><p>Hong Kong used the FTX collapse to reduce regulatory risks associated with centralized exchanges. In December, nearly 30 days after the exchange crisis unfolded, its legislative council <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-to-subject-crypto-exchanges-to-the-same-laws-governing-tradfi\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-to-subject-crypto-exchanges-to-the-same-laws-governing-tradfi/amp\">included virtual asset service providers in the same legislation</a> that governs traditional financial institutions.</p><p><strong><em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-government-pressures-bank-giants-accept-crypto-clients\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-government-pressures-bank-giants-accept-crypto-clients/amp\">Related: Hong Kong govt pressures banking giants to accept crypto clients</a></em></strong></p><p>The new rules bring strict AML guidelines and investor protection laws to virtual exchanges looking to open a business in Hong Kong. It also introduces a new licensing scheme that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-brokers-line-up-for-sfc-approval-ahead-of-new-virtual-asset-trading-legislation\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-brokers-line-up-for-sfc-approval-ahead-of-new-virtual-asset-trading-legislation/amp\">allows retail investors the ability to trade</a> in virtual assets. Until recently, digital assets trading was restricted to professional investors and traders with at least $1 million in bankable assets. </p><p>According to Leung, Hong Kong's cryptocurrency licensing system is a good example of China's \"one country, two systems\" policy. Cryptocurrencies have been banned in Mainland China since 2021, while Hong Kong took a different approach by promoting a welcoming environment for crypto business. </p><p>Over the past 12 months, more than 150 Web3 firms <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-says-cyberport-attracted-150-web3-firms-in-a-year\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-says-cyberport-attracted-150-web3-firms-in-a-year/amp\">have established operations in Hong Kong’s Cyberport</a> — a digital hub created by the local government to promote innovation. The influx came after the government allocated 50 million yuan ($7 million) to speed up the development of Web3.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/best-worst-countries-crypto-taxes-crypto-tax-tips/\"><strong><em>Magazine:</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>Best and worst countries for crypto taxes — Plus crypto tax tips</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "
