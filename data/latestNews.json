    "description": "The cryptocurrency market has been in a declining trend for years. However, reports reveal a possible recovery and bullish turn for popular cryptocurrencies in the space. JP Morgan has predicted a possible price rebound for Bitcoin, saying that long-term liquidations are “largely behind us.” JP Morgan Sees Upside For Bitcoin Price JP Morgan, an American multinational financial services firm published an interesting research report on Thursday, August 24. Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Managing Director at JP Morgan indicated that crypto markets are likely to emerge from the declining trend from liquidations and market turmoil and move into a correction phase completely.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Buys 708 Billion SHIB, Sparks Speculation Of Price Recovery They believe that the crypto market has been able to overcome a significant amount of negative factors that push the market to a “limited downside.” Their predictions are also based on the indications of a decline in open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a global derivatives marketplace.  The crypto market has been on a severe declining trend while Bitcoin&#8217;s progress has been muffled after experiencing devastating market blows, and regulatory hurdles. The stunning fall of Terra stablecoin was one of the major challenges the industry faced, wiping over $200 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets from the space. FTX’s collapse has also pushed the evolution of cryptocurrencies back by a couple of years, shattering investor’s confidence in the crypto space and hinting at the lack of a better regulatory framework in the industry.  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been in hot pursuit of new victims, throwing lawsuits against prominent exchanges and crypto firms like Binance, and Coinbase. All things considered, Bitcoin&#8217;s fight against evolutionary pressures has yielded positive results. A crypto analyst provided compelling insights on Bitcoin’s network, revealing that the spikes in on-chain transfers seen in Bitcoin’s network activity are a great indicator for a probable macro uptrend for the cryptocurrency.  &#160; #Bitcoin network activity, particularly the USD value of coins transferred on-chain, is a compelling indicator for predicting macro uptrends.

Ripple’s victory against the SEC is among said developments. The XRP ruling by Judge Annalise Torres has brought new optimism in the space and has also provided essential regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies.  Additionally, the increase in applications for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also boosted its price considerably. World-leading financial services providers like Blackrock, Ark Investment, Hashdex, Grayscale, and others are already competing for a spot in Bitcoin ETF.  Related Reading: MasterCard Axes Partnership With Binance Amid Regulatory Pressures There are also reports of a potential collaboration between Bitcoin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX to enable cross-border payments for space-linked activities.  Overall, the crypto landscape is showing signs of stability as it navigates through major industry hurdles. Crypto investors are also eagerly anticipating the potential recovery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  BTC price retraces to $25,000 level &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
