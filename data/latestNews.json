Source: Ana Paula Pereira/Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried began on Oct. 3 with jury selection. Bankman-Fried is charged with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud in connection with the collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded. He <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-s-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges-report\">has pleaded not guilty</a> to all charges. The case is being heard by Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has presided over a long list of other high-profile cases, including ones involving detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the Gambino crime family, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump.</p><p>Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-orders-sam-bankman-fried-bail-revoked-following-allegations-witness-intimidation\">was ordered to be jailed</a> on Aug. 11 after Kaplan found that his sharing of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s personal papers amounted to witness intimidation. Alameda Research was a trading house also founded by Bankman-Fried. Previously, he had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-sent-home-after-his-parents-put-up-their-house-to-cover-his-astronomical-bail-bond\">been under house arrest</a> in his parents’ home in Stanford, California on a $250-million bond.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB1zBrqHPLw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>December: SBF arrested</h3><p>Bankman-Fried was arrested in the United States on his arrival from the Bahamas on Dec. 21, 2022. He had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-and-in-custody-attorney-general\">been arrested in the Bahamas</a> on Dec. 12 after the U.S. government formally notified the country of charges the U.S. was filing against him. He declared his intention to fight extradition from the Caribbean nation but changed his mind after a week in Bahaman jail and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-reverse-decision-on-contesting-extradition-report\">consented to extradition</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO (and reportedly sometime SBF girlfriend) Ellison <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/caroline-ellison-gary-wang-plead-guilty-to-fraud-charges\">agreed to plead guilty</a> in the burgeoning case.</p><h3>November: FTX collapses</h3><p>Bankman-Fried’s troubles began when reports emerged on Nov. 2 that Alameda Research had a large holding of FTX Token (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ftx-token-ftt-price-index\">FTT</a>), FTX’s utility token. That revelation led to questions about the relationship between the two entities. On Nov. 6, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival exchange Binance, announced that his exchange <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-to-liquidate-its-entire-ftx-token-holdings-after-recent-revelations\">would liquidate its FTT</a> holdings, which were estimated to be worth $2.1 billion. Zhao turned down an offer tweeted by Ellison to buy Binance’s FTT.</p><p>A run <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-addresses-user-withdrawal-complaints-amid-major-token-movement\">began on FTX</a>. Bankman-Fried gave reassurances on Twitter (now X) that the exchange’s “assets are fine” and accused “a competitor” of spreading rumors. By Nov. 8, the price of FTT had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-token-price-risks-30-plunge-as-a-23m-ftt-part-moves-to-binance\">fallen from $22</a> to $15.40.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It’s only been one week since SBF’s notorious “FTX is fine.

This will clear out liquidity crunches; all assets will be covered 1:1.”</p><p>On Nov. 9, Zhao announced that Binance <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-s-binance-rescue-deal-falls-apart-in-less-than-48-hours\">would not pursue the acquisition of FTX</a> after due diligence and more reports of mishandled funds. The price of Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-multi-year-low-at-15-6k-analysts-expect-further-downside\">plummeted to $15,600</a>. The FTX and Alameda Research <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/alameda-s-research-and-ftx-ventures-websites-taken-down\">websites went dark</a> for a few hours. When the FTX website came back, it bore a warning against making deposits and was unable to process withdrawals.</p><p>On Nov. 10, Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-apologizes-over-ftx-liquidity-crisis-i-fucked-up-twice\">posted a 22-part Twitter thread</a> that began with “I’m sorry.” It was the first of a long string of public statements he made about the exchange’s fall. The following day, the entire staff of Alameda Research quit, and FTX, FTX.US and Alameda Research <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-ftx-us-and-alameda-file-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-us-sbf-resigns\">filed for bankruptcy in the United States</a>. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX CEO and was replaced by John J. Ray III. Ray was best known for his role in the Enron bankruptcy.</p><h3>SBF and FTX before the fall</h3><p>At the beginning of 2022, FTX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-exchange-breaks-32b-valuation-despite-crypto-winter-fears\">had a $32-billion valuation</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-revenue-reportedly-grew-1000-in-one-year-leaked-documents-reveal\">was thought to be in enviable financial condition</a>. Bankman-Fried was seen as a respected business leader by much of the crypto community and the world at large. He was photographed with political leaders and <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Bankman-Fried_0209202211.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">spoke</a> at Congressional <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AG/AG00/20220512/114729/HHRG-117-AG00-Wstate-Bankman-FriedS-20220512.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hearings</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Maxine Waters is chairing the investigation into FTX <a href=\"https://t.co/oFMctH4rRh\">https://t.co/oFMctH4rRh</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ox6O5w4nOl\">pic.twitter.com/Ox6O5w4nOl</a></p>&mdash; Jordan Schachtel @ dossier.today (@JordanSchachtel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1593289220755525632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>He had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sam-bankman-fried-the-crypto-whale-who-wants-to-give-billions-away/\">gained a reputation as a philanthropist</a>, pursuing a philosophy popular among academics known as effective altruism.

Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Ripple’s favorable court decision spurred mixed opinions from experts</h2><p>In an Oct. 3 court order, Judge Torres claimed that the matter did not require an order that \"involved a controlling question of law,\" which is an essential condition for approving an interlocutory appeal. This decision <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/lawyers-debate-over-ripple-case-judge-reject-sec-motion-appeal\">sparked a debate among crypto law experts</a> in the community.</p><p>Bill Hughes, a lawyer at blockchain firm ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph that the rejection of the SEC's appeal was fairly expected, given that appeals of this nature are not usual during this part of a trial.</p><p>Similarly, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, warned XRP bulls to temper their enthusiasm, as the SEC could still appeal the case later. This means that the regulator needs to wait until after the trial's conclusion, which is scheduled to begin on April 23, 2024.</p><h2>Ripple gets approval for a Singapore digital payments license</h2><p>In an Oct. 4 statement, Ripple announced that its local entity, Ripple Markets Asia Pacific, was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-approval-singapore-payments-license\">granted a \"Major Payment Institution (MPI) license\"</a> for digital payment token services in Singapore. This decision will allow the company to continue operations in the city-state after receiving in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in June.</p><p>According to Ripple, the license allows its subsidiary to further scale its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service offering, an enterprise solution that uses XRP as a bridge between two currencies. This eliminates the need for pre-funding of destination accounts and reduces operational costs.</p><h2>Ripple picked as a contender for Georgia’s CBDC pilot</h2><p>On Sept. 28, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) announced that nine companies, including Ripple, would take part in the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/georgia-cbdc-pilot-ripple-tech-providers\">research of their central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a>. Known as the digital lari, or GEL, the project aims to be programmable and support asset tokenization.</p><p>The Eastern European country, with a population of 3.7 million, intends to launch a limited-access live pilot environment, where only one of the participating companies will be selected to move forward. The NBG announced that it was considering issuing a CBDC in May 2021, without providing a timeline for it.</p><h2>There was modest impact on XRP derivatives’ demand</h2><p>The demand for XRP futures did not present meaningful changes as the open interest, which measures the aggregate notional of contracts still in play, increased by 13% versus the previous day. Furthermore, the current $590 million open interest falls short to the $794 million from one month prior.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/47aa7a24-43c1-4186-9fb9-7bff9e97cd46.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP futures open-interest weighted funding rate, 8-hour. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice that the XRP futures funding rate has consistently stayed below 0.01% every 8 hours, which is equivalent to 0.20% per week. Positive values indicate that long positions are covering the cost of leverage, but a funding rate below 1% per week is generally not considered expensive.</p><p>Considering the inability to surpass the $0.54 mark, which would have been the highest level in six weeks, and the lack of demand for leverage through futures contracts, it's reasonable to doubt whether the recent positive news flow has convinced investors that XRP is about to enter a bull run.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description": "In a recent interview, Chainlink&#8217;s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, said the collapse of the banking industry will drive crypto mass adoption. Chainlink’s Co-Founder Predicts Crypto And Blockchain Prospects Over The Next Decade Sergey Nazarov believes that the collapse of the banking industry will favor crypto adoption and growth in the next decade. Related Reading: Crypto Is On The Brink Of Explosion As 9-Year DXY Formation Returns Nazarov believes the crypto industry and its technological innovations might maintain the same slow growth pace. However, the industry player cited two possible crypto and blockchain adoption scenarios in the next ten years. First, the Chainlink co-founder proposed a fast-case scenario where the collapse of the traditional finance system puts individuals in pain. This pain will force individuals to &#8220;acknowledge the relevance&#8221; of cryptographic financial systems.  Further, Nazarov noted that the continued collapse of banks like Silicon Valley Bank could fast-track crypto adoption.  Secondly, based on the first theory, the collapse of traditional finance systems will lead to political tension and international problems. Nazarov believes investors will favor crypto for financial operations if the pain of suffering losses becomes unbearable.  Therefore, Nazarov insists that even in the slow case, the crypto market is likely on its way to a $10 trillion market cap.  Chainlink’s Adoption By ANZ Banking Group Supports Nazarov’s Growth Theory According to a new industry report, ANZ Bank has adopted Chainlink’s CCIP for cross-chain tokenized asset settlement. CCIP solution helps to transfer data and tokenized assets across blockchains in a decentralized and secure way, according to the crypto founder.  Notably, ANZ Bank is one of the world&#8217;s largest banks, with over $1 trillion in total assets managed. Sergey Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s adoption by ANZ shows how large companies are now adopting Chainlink’s CCIP.  Also, the co-founder stated that building on a global internet needs secure connectivity between private bank chains and public chains.  The CCIP is an upgrade on the Chainlink Network that functions as a global Internet of Contracts. This upgrade aims to create the world’s largest liquidity layer across various regions and markets.  Remarkably, Nazarov stated that CCIP can create a higher level of cross-chain security. It achieves this extra security with multiple layers of decentralization and advanced risk management techniques.  Moreover, most cryptocurrencies offer users fast and secure cross-border transactions cheaply. However, some critics still insist that cryptocurrencies are unreliable based on their volatility and crisis in the sector.  Related Reading: Will XRP Price Defy A 50% Stock Market Crash? Analysts Share Predictions With innovations like the CCIP of Chainlink, more banks may integrate crypto and blockchain-based solutions. This drives crypto to mainstream adoption, increasing the market cap to $10 trillion, as Nazarov predicts. Meanwhile, the collapse of banks such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023 has strained the global finance economy. If another banking crisis occurs, cryptocurrencies might become the preferred option for most investors based on their rising utility. Featured image from Shutterstock and chart from TradingView.com"
