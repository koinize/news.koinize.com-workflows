To feel something and observe something and not know that the image was painted by a robot. And then only afterwards they realized it was painted by a robot, then that becomes part of the narrative. They can do a double take, they learn the story through that. </p><p><strong><em>Who are the influences on your art career to date?</em></strong></p><p>I don’t want to answer here. I don’t want to answer because I’m friends with some of them now and I don’t want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they were my influencers haha. </p><p>If they found out, they’d become intolerable which is absolutely true. This is what I love about this space, I am hanging out with my big influencers and it’s really fun. Love it. </p><p><strong><em>Who is a notable collector of yours that makes you smile knowing they own one of your pieces?</em></strong></p><p>There’s one collector I have and thats unusual and I really enjoy how unusual this collector is because this collector is silent and has possibly the largest AI art collection in the crypto space but has no social media presence. Zero. </p><p>This collector is ironically named Blur, not the platform. Why Blur really brings a smile to my face is they are so conscientious about their collecting that they don’t want to influence other people, they don’t want to ape into something and then have other people ape into it because they aped into it. I think that’s really noble, the collecting is coming from the heart and they never advertise their bags yet collect like mad. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-2022-will-real-btc-maximalists-please-stand-up/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Bitcoin 2022  Will the real maximalists please stand up?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-in-the-philippines-necessity-is-the-mother-of-adoption/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Crypto in the Philippines: Necessity is the mother of adoption</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p><br><strong><em>Whats your favorite NFT in your wallet thats not your own NFT?</em></strong></p><p>The one that gives me the most joy is my CryptoPunk.
