A positive rebase, for example, increases the token supply and reduces the balances of current holders if the tokenâ€™s price climbs above the target. On the other hand, a negative rebase lowers the supply and increases the value of existing holdings if the price drops below the target.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-rebase-tokens-and-how-do-they-work\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
