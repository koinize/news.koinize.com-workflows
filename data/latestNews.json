    "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Feds have charged a former engineer for the hack and $9 million exploit of a Solana-based cryptocurrency exchange.&nbsp;</p>\nIRS And Homeland Security Charge Former Engineer\n<p>New York prosecutors have charged a former senior security engineer at an international technology company, Shakeeb Ahmed, in the first-ever criminal case involving an attack on an unnamed decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's smart contract, resulting in approximately $9 million worth of inflated fees. He then laundered the stolen funds through complex transactions on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>IRS Agent Tyler Hatcher said,</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Mr. Ahmed used his skills as a computer security engineer to steal millions of dollars.&nbsp; He then allegedly tried to hide the stolen funds, but his skills were no match for IRS Criminal Investigation's Cyber Crimes Unit.&nbsp; We, along with our partners at HSI and the Department of Justice, are at the forefront of cyber investigations and will track these fraudsters anywhere they try to hide and hold them accountable.&rdquo;</p>\n\nManipulated Pricing Data To Inflate Fees\n<p>The attack targeted a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange operating on the Solana blockchain. The exchange allowed users to exchange various cryptocurrencies and pay fees to those who provided liquidity. Ahmed&rsquo;s attack involved inserting fake pricing data into the smart contract, causing it to generate inflated fees in the range of $9 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After generating the fees, he engaged in token-swap transactions and bridged the fraud proceeds from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. He also converted the proceeds into Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency that is hard to trace. Ahmed further attempted to cover his tracks by using overseas cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>\nTracked Down Through Online Activities\n<p>Following the attack, Ahmed approached the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds for a bounty fee of $1.5 million on the condition that the crypto exchange promised not to approach law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, his actions did not go unnoticed by authorities. Investigators tracked his online activities, which included searches for information on the attack, criminal liability, and potential escape from the United States to evade charges.</p>\n<p>Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz said,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic banking security.&nbsp; With an attack of this magnitude, it&rsquo;s crucial we ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system&hellip;It&rsquo;s cases like these that demonstrate HSI&rsquo;s commitment and ability to work with a coalition of the willing to dismantle these complicated and technical fraud schemes and identify those responsible regardless of where they operate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/aptos-apt/aptos-apt-succumbs-to-bearish-pressure/",
    "description": "APT, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain, continues to exhibit an underwhelming market performance in 2023. Following a somewhat positive run at the beginning of July, it seems the bears are back in control, with APT’s value dipping by nearly 10% in the last seven days. This has pretty much been the case for the APT token since the end of January as its price has declined steadily since reaching its all-time high of $18.58 on January 26. APT Falls By 14% In One Week &#8211; Price Overview  The Aptos token made a bright start to July, gaining more than 13% in a few days. However, the prominent altcoin has shed all its recent gains, now trading below the month’s opening price of $7.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Downtrend Set To Persist – What To Expect After reaching a high of $8.24 on July 4, the Aptos token experienced a significant decline, bringing its value to $7.15 two days later.  Since then, it appears that the coin&#8217;s price has been moving mostly sideways. But it is worth noting that APT fell below the $7 price level for the first time this month on July 8. The token dropped below this level again on July 10 before climbing back to $7.18 the following day. As of this writing, APT is valued at $7.03, with a mere 0.3% gain in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the coin has a market capitalization of over $1.48 billion, making it the 36th-biggest cryptocurrency. The Aptos token has a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $48.9 million, representing a 14.6% decline in the past day. Is The Downward Trend Over? A look at the daily chart shows that the APT token faces significant resistance at the $8 price zone. The token’s price has failed to break through this level twice in the past three weeks, falling back to $7 at each instance.  That said, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the selling pressure is high at the moment, having crossed below the 50 mark. This means there may not be sufficient buying pressure to push the token’s price above the $8 resistance. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Meanwhile, price action data reveals that APT has been stuck in a downtrend channel since the high of $16.22 made on February 16, 2023. Over the past five months, Aptos has failed to record a higher high, while writing three lower lows. If Aptos continues in its descending trend channel, we might see its price fall below $4. On the flip side, if it manages to break out of the downtrend channel and through the $8 resistance, then cryptocurrency might reach a price of $10.
