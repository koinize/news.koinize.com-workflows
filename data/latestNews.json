To shape the technological development of AI, we need effective governance frameworks underpinned by the ethical and moral values we all hold dear.” </blockquote><p>Along with best practices, the information gathered will assist in the creation of future training sessions to improve “institutional capacity” on the topic. </p><p>UNESCO has already played a large role in creating ethical guidelines for AI in November 2021, which all of its member states adopted. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-to-help-brewers-and-farmers-preserve-unesco-belgian-beer-heritage\"><strong><em>NFTs to help brewers and farmers preserve UNESCO Belgian beer heritage</em></strong></a></p><p>These moves from UNESCO come after the<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-union-ai-act-passes-in-parliament\"> EU’s AI Act was passed</a> in parliament in June 2022.
