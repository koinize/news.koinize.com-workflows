The series, which features as part of the <em>Decentralize with Cointelegraph</em> podcast, will explore the evolving world of zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) and the next steps for the adoption of blockchain technology.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/49c789ec-5cd6-48fc-a34c-b07717f0d7c6.jpg\"  /></figure><p>Throughout the series, three different hosts from the Cointelegraph team will be joined by different guests from the StarkWare ecosystem. Zero-knowledge protocols or rollups have become a prominent layer-2 scaling feature in the crypto ecosystem, especially for the Ethereum blockchain. </p><p>In the first episode, titled: “How blockchain is taking on the world,” StarkWare CEO and co-founder Uri Kolodny sits down with its chief architect Eli Ben-Sasson to explore the future of Ethereum and why they believe in the success of blockchain technology. The episode is co-hosted with Nathan Jeffay of StarkWare.</p><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2040516\"></template><p>ZK technology allows one party to prove the existence of information to another party without revealing the data itself. Multiple scaling solution providers have developed their own ZK-rollup protocols, with StarkWare launching Starknet in November 2021.</p><p>Starknet is a decentralized validity rollup or ZK-rollup, which operates as an Ethereum layer 2, enabling any app to scale on the network. Recently, Starknet moved one step closer to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-evm-compatibility-scalability-zk-evm-kakarot-testnet\">becoming fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible</a>, pending an August testnet launch of Kakarot, a new zero-knowledge EVM.</p><p>ZK-rollups increase throughput on the Ethereum mainnet by moving computation and state storage off-chain. The technology can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), greatly improving the roughly 30 TPS handled by the Ethereum mainnet. And it can achieve this without sharing sensitive transaction data, making it a prominent privacy-focused scaling solution.</p><p>ZK has emerged as an effective scaling technology, and this podcast series aims to offer exclusive insights into the ZK ecosystem from those building the technology.
