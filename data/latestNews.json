    "description": "Over the course of Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), John Deaton has grown to become one of the most prominent voices in support of the crypto firm. The result of this was a list containing 75,000 potential intervenors, all of which hold XRP. Up until now, the regional composition of this 75,000-holder list has been unknown. But Deaton has finally revealed which countries are leading the pack as ‚Äòpotential intervenors.‚Äô The United States Leads The 75,000 XRP Holder List In a tweet shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton revealed to his more than 292,000 followers that the United States made up the majority of the 75,000 XRP holder list. The tweet highlighted that US holders currently make up 53% of the list, making it the leading region.

This is then followed by Australia, which the lawyer excitedly reveals has moved up to the third position as of the last time he checked the holder list. However, Deaton explained that Australia‚Äôs lead over Canada in the fourth place only comes down to a difference of around 11 holders. The lawyer‚Äôs tweet comes in response to an announcement from the Wave of Innovation official X handle that Deaton would be the keynote speaker of an upcoming event. The event totaled ‚ÄúXRP Gold Coast‚Äù would run from March 22-24 in 2024, and Deaton was picked as the keynote speaker due to his ‚Äúsignificant contributions to the XRP community through his legal work and advocacy efforts.‚Äù Deaton went on to highlight his pleasure of being the keynote speaker at this event by pointing out Australia‚Äôs growing dominance on the 75,000 XRP holder list. ‚ÄúI could not say no, nor pass on the opportunity to meet many of them,‚Äù he tweeted. I checked the 75K #XRP Holder list. Australia üá¶üá∫ has moved to the #3 spot. About 53% of the 75K #XRP Holders are from the United States üá∫üá∏ The United Kingdom üá¨üáß comes in at #2.

While Ripple Labs battled the SEC in the courtrooms, Deaton was the attorney of choice for XRP investors who wanted to make their voices heard in the case. Support for Ripple had grown rapidly as many referred to the regulator‚Äôs actions as an overreach. Meanwhile, the number of XRP investors throwing their hats in the ring grew to over 75,000 on Deaton‚Äôs list. Related Reading: Can Ripple Control The XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In According to the attorney, being on this ‚Äô75K List‚Äô meant that XRP investors could potentially be able to seek reimbursement if the price of XRP were to suffer as a result of the regulator‚Äôs actions. The legal battle that began in 2020 is currently still ongoing with the SEC filing an interlocutory appeal in response to Judge Analisa Torres‚Äôs ruling back in July. So whether or not there will be any reimbursement for XRP holders impacted by the regulator‚Äôs actions remains to be seen. Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com"
