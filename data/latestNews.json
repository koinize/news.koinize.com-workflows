Crypto industry members including Ryan Wyatt, president of Polygon Labs and legal experts appeared before the committee to engage in a much more amicable dialogue. </p><p>This meeting was held just after the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-lawsuit-binance-coinbase-crypto-industry-comments#:~:text=Professionals%20across%20the%20crypto%20sector,for%20allegedly%20offering%20unregistered%20securities.\">SEC announced back-to-back lawsuits</a> against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. In Wyatt’s testimony, he <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/IDC_Wyatt_Testimony_Blockchain_Hearing_2023_06_07_e9c81155cb.pdf?updated_at=2023-06-05T15:54:09.404Z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">discussed</a> the potential of blockchain technology and its value to users, as well as the benefits of building a healthy and well-regulated blockchain ecosystem in the United States.</p><p>Wyatt began by addressing the fundamental problem that blockchains solve, which is the \"value extraction\" problem on the Internet. He explained that in the current era of the internet – referred to as \"Web2\", large centralized tech companies extract value from users by charging fees for goods and services and collecting user data for their own benefit.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, I had the privilege of testifying at the Innovation, Data &amp; Commerce subcommittee at a Congressional hearing focused on educating lawmakers on why this tech is important to all of us, and how it changes the value paradigm of the Internet.<br><br>We are in this together. <a href=\"https://t.co/l8OcDM12hB\">pic.twitter.com/l8OcDM12hB</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Wyatt (@Fwiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fwiz/status/1666506738080653312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>According to Wyatt, blockchains offer a solution to this problem by democratizing the Internet and creating a Web3 that is based on decentralized and transparent systems. Blockchains use cryptography and a network of computers to secure and maintain information, eliminating the need for a centralized authority. In this Web3 model, users have control over their data and can choose when, how, and whether to share it with applications and services. </p><p>In regards to how the U.S. government could partner with the industry to advance modernization, Wyatt mentioned that the current regulatory environment is a major barrier. By fostering a well-regulated blockchain ecosystem, the U.S. can maintain its competitive edge and ensure the technology industry thrives domestically:</p><blockquote>\"When regulation does not meet novel technology where it is, the U.S. loses its competitive edge over other countries.\"</blockquote><p>Finally, Wyatt argued that building a blockchain technology ecosystem in the United States is beneficial for Americans. It can drive economic growth and create jobs, both in the technology sector and non-technical sectors. It also allows for better consumer protection by leveraging the transparency of blockchains and aligning regulation with novel technologies. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-financial-services-committee-sets-date-to-discuss-future-of-crypto\"><strong><em>US Financial Services Committee sets date to discuss future of crypto</em></strong></a></p><p>Wyatt’s testimony provides several examples of Web3 applications and use cases, such as blockchain-based consumer loyalty programs, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world#:~:text=NFTs%20refer%20to%20nonfungible%20tokens,based%20video%20games%20and%20video.\">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) in the fashion industry, blockchain-based community organizations and blockchain solutions for supply chain management in the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Defense. </p><p>The hearing comes on the heels of a separate House hearing Tuesday, where the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-ag-committee-looks-at-digital-assets-regulatory-bill-dems-ask-how-to-pay-for-it\">Agriculture Committee grilled exchange executives and former regulators</a> on compliance and consumer protection.
