Once it completes testing, it will allow for “a more decentralized and efficient Superchain,” the post stated. The new system is currently deployed to the Optimism Goerli network. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/42960400-9d69-4083-bb0d-d2bd5875a3d5.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Optimism Goerli block explorer. Source: Etherscan</em></figcaption></figure><p>Currently, OP Stack-based networks use centralized sequencers to bundle transactions and submit them to Ethereum. Users cannot submit fraud proofs to block the sequencer if it submits incorrect data, creating the possibility of fraudulent transactions being confirmed if an attacker can control it. L2Beat has <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/optimism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">warned</a> of this risk in its report on Optimism, stating, “users need to trust block Proposer to submit correct L1 state roots.”</p><p>OP Stack-based networks like Optimism and Base are intended to be optimistic rollups — a type of layer 2 that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions\">relies on Ethereum for its security</a>. In a January 2021 essay, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that optimistic rollups <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">must</a> allow users to submit fraud proofs to block fraudulent withdrawals to Ethereum. Otherwise, they’re not truly decentralized.</p><p>In November 2022, Buterin <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">claimed</a> that some rollups could have “training wheels” that keep them temporarily centralized while they work on a fraud-proof system but argued that they should work toward decentralization.</p><p>OP Labs claims the new fault-proof system will help fulfill the goal of decentralization for OP Stack networks: “The system is designed to eventually enable secure bridging without central fallback.”</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-optimism-scaling-platform-op-bnb-hits-mainnet\"><strong>BNB Smart Chain Optimism-powered layer-2 opBNB hits mainnet</strong></a></em></p><p>In addition, it claimed the new system is modular, allowing each network to develop its own system for preventing fraud. It consists of three separate components: a fault-proof program (FPP), a fault-proof virtual machine (FPVM) and a “dispute game protocol.” Because these three components can be implemented separately, it opens up the possibility for each network to “custom-build a fault proof system.”</p><p>According to the post, this will create more diversity in the Optimism Superchain, ultimately making the whole ecosystem more secure. A network could even decide to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) as a type of fraud-proof, the team stated. ZK-proofs are generally utilized in zero-knowledge rollups, but not Optimistic ones.</p><p>OP Labs has been trying to build an interconnected web of blockchain networks <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/optimism-successfully-completes-bedrock-hard-fork-reducing-deposit-times-layer-1-fees\">called the “Superchain.</a>” To accomplish this, it created the OP Stack, a set of software tools that can be used to create custom blockchain networks. Avail network has <a href=\"https://blog.availproject.org/opevm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">created</a> “OpEVM” software designed to accomplish the same objective while using Avail as the base layer instead of Ethereum. Polygon’s ZK Supernets and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine Hyperchain are other examples of Superchain competitors.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/optimism-network-launches-testnet-fault-proof-system-pursuit-decentralization&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

As a result, long liquidations in the derivatives market force the asset's price further lower when combined with sell-pressure in the spot markets.</p><p>The past 24 hours have witnessed long liquidations worth around $23 million versus over $5 million in short liquidations, according to CoinGlass. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/42d0ebbb-3906-4f80-a552-9df31fdc3712.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto liquidation heatmap of the past 24 hours.

    "description": "BSV has bucked a bearish trend amid the general crypto market downturn, posting notable gains over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin SV (BSV) recorded an 8% 24-hour price increase, while Bitcoin succumbed to bearish pressure, dipping nearly 3% today, October 3. As a result of today’s uptick, BSV now trades at $40.4, representing an 8% increase in the last 24 hours. Also, the token has recorded over 31% seven-day increase, regaining over 34% of its past month’s gains.  Related Reading: Solana Outperforms 2 Top Altcoins – Its Ripple Effect On Prices These prominent strides confirm buyers&#8217; dominance in the BSV market today. However, given the bearish state of the general crypto market, how long can BSV sustain this rally? What factors triggered this dramatic surge? Let&#8217;s find out. Bitcoin SV Price Surges Amidst Controversy Surrounding CEO’s Resignation BSV price gains correlate with the sudden resignation of nChain&#8217;s CEO, Christen Ager-Hanssen, on September 29. nChain is a firm that offers blockchain-based services related to the BSV chain. Its former CEO, Ager-Hanssen, immediately announced his departure from the group on September 29.  Ager-Hassen mentioned reporting several issues to the nChain board, which included a conspiracy to defraud shareholders. He also stated that a significant shareholder orchestrated the conspiracy.  Further, he claimed to discover evidence that BSV creator Dr. Craig Wright manipulated documents to deceive the court that he was Satoshi.  However, Bitcoin SV&#8217;s supporter Calvin Ayre reviewed Anger-Hanssen&#8217;s departure. According to Ayre, Anger-Hanssen has never run a successful company and lies to steal assets Notably, Bitcoin SV sparked to life after nChain released a statement that Stefan Matthews would take over as acting CEO. Recent Tweet By Supposed Bitcoin Founder Boosts Investor Sentiment On BSV Another event that occurred around BSV was an October 2, 2023, tweet from an account claiming to be Bitcoin&#8217;s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly, the last tweet from this account was on October 31, 2018.  According to a recent tweet, Nakamoto stated that Bitcoin is a predicated machine. He revealed his desire to explore other aspects of the project not contained in the whitepaper.  The tweet attracted positive reactions, with one user stating that the first post since 2018 has to mean something. Since Bitcoin BSV supposedly aligns with the original Bitcoin vision, it benefited from this sentiment. The reactions likely increased investor confidence, leading to massive token demand and today’s 8% uptick.  Although the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and his involvement in this saga remains a mystery, these controversies positively affected BSV&#8217;s price. What Next For BSV? BSV has flipped the $32.6 resistance into support to form a large green candle on October 2. It faces the next resistance at the $40.4 price level. A break above this level will likely send BSV up to $42.  Since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the overbought zone at 81.9, it confirms the strong buying pressure pushing BSV up. Nevertheless, traders should expect a slight retracement in the coming days once the buyers begin to make a profit.
