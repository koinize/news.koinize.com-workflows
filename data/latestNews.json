During the event, deputy chief prosecutor No-Seong called for regulating the OTC crypto market due to money laundering concerns. </p><p>A google translated version of Seong‚Äôs statement read:</p><blockquote>\"Illegal virtual currency OTC companies have overseas corporations and are engaged in the business of converting illegally obtained virtual currency into Korean won or foreign currency. There is a need to regulate these companies as undeclared virtual asset trading businesses.\"</blockquote><p>The term \"OTC crypto market\" describes exchanges that are not officially recognised by the government. Virtual currency over-the-counter (OTC) transactions include all transactions outside regulated platforms including peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges. According to the report, there are a total of 172 cryptocurrencies available on Upbit, the largest regulated crypto platform in South Korea, while OTC platforms offer upto 700 cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The report cited several instances of the use of OTC platforms to convert virtual assets into Korean won. The International Crimes Investigation Department of the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office arrested and indicted three people on charges of engaging in illegal foreign exchange transactions between October 2021 and October 2022. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coin-center-responds-lawmakers-request-crypto-tax-guidance\"><strong><em>Coin Center responds to US lawmakers‚Äô request for crypto tax guidance</em></strong></a></p><p>The arrested trio were found to be purchasing $70.9 million (94 billion won) worth of virtual currency from overseas OTC at the request of Libyans and then sending it to Korea to be converted into cash, according to the report. The value of unlawful foreign exchange transactions made using virtual currency was estimated by the Korea Customs Service to be worth $4 billion (5.6 trillion won) last year.</p><p>South Korea over the years has become a country known for its stringent crypto regulations over the years and has several regulations in place to tackle crypto-related crimes.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-price-outlook-could-we-see-a-10-dip-due-to-supply-pressure/",
    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has found itself caught in a tug-of-war between buying pressures and bearish sentiment, leaving investors and enthusiasts wondering about the coin&#8217;s future direction.¬† A sudden dip in DOGE&#8217;s price sent shockwaves through the market, breaking a pivotal support trendline that had historically bolstered the coin&#8217;s recovery phases. This breach raised concerns of a continued decline, but recent developments suggest that the meme-inspired cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a fresh rally. One glimmer of hope for DOGE came in the form of newfound support at the $0.06 price level. This development, combined with the broader market&#8217;s bullish sentiment, contributed to a modest recovery earlier today.¬† Related Reading: Dogecoin Key Challenge: Will The $0.06 Support Level Hold? However, it&#8217;s important to note that the price has since experienced some corrections, highlighting the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency space. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.061802 on CoinGecko, reflecting a 1.0% decline in the past 24 hours and a 0.6% loss over the past week. DOGE‚Äôs Bearish Threat Looms¬† Despite the recent positive movement, DOGE remains vulnerable to potential bearish pressures. If bears manage to establish dominance around the overhead trendline, particularly at the $0.064 price level, the meme coin may face renewed selling pressure. In such a scenario, a decline of 10-12% could be on the horizon, potentially pushing DOGE prices toward the $0.057 region. DOGE market cap currently at $8.7 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, in a surprising turn of events over the weekend, Billy Markus, the creator of Dogecoin, took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the state of the Dogecoin community. Responding to a user&#8217;s lament about the decline in community engagement, Markus did not hold back.¬† He declared the Dogecoin community as &#8220;dead&#8221; for over a year, placing blame on its most active members for creating unnecessary drama rather than fostering a positive environment. I&#8217;ve observed a decline in the Dogecoin community recently. It appears that many are prioritizing ad revenue over engaging with our own community. It&#8217;s disheartening to see making $10-15 become more important than nurturing the community. üò¢ ‚Äî Tyler Milgate (@MilgateTyler) September 14, 2023 DOGE Continues To Shine While Markus&#8217;s words may seem harsh, they carry an air of irony. Dogecoin, with its iconic Shiba Inu mascot, remains a beloved figure in the meme-cryptocurrency landscape, transcending traditional expectations for digital assets. This ironic twist adds an element of intrigue to the ongoing Dogecoin narrative, as enthusiasts and traders eagerly await the next chapter in this rollercoaster journey. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) May Have A Chance At A Bullish Streak ‚Äì Here‚Äôs How Dogecoin&#8217;s recent price fluctuations, combined with the candid remarks of its creator, have ignited speculation about the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. As DOGE navigates the ups and downs of the crypto market, one thing remains certain: the world will continue to watch this meme coin with a mix of fascination and amusement. Whether it&#8217;s a fresh rally or more turbulence on the horizon, Dogecoin enthusiasts are always in for a wild ride. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.
