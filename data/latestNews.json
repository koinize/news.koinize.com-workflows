    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-activity-ada-price-soaring/",
    "description": "Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a price rut recently, but behind the scenes, activity on the Cardano blockchain is exploding. Transaction volumes and wallet addresses are all growing, showing that interest and adoption of the network are growing rapidly. All this activity has prompted analysis of how far the crypto can spike in the near future. Cardano On-Chain Activity Points To Future Price Growth Cardano&#8217;s growth in development activity in recent months has rivaled other cryptocurrencies, putting it on the map among developers. Metrics show that there are currently 1,322 projects under development. Similarly, Plutus V2 scripts recently reached 18,821, and Plutus V1 scripts also stand at 6,536 to make a total of 25,357, indicating the growth of smart contracts. Related Reading: Massive $29.3 Million Whale Transfer Threatens XRP Price With More Sell Pressure These scripts are essential for deploying smart contracts on the Cardano chain and have seen a 76% growth from 14,379 scripts recorded on January 1. At the same time, Cardano&#8217;s transaction count in the past two months has been something to boast about. The Cardano ADA network recently successfully completed 255,000 payments in 24 hours. Particularly, December and January saw Cardano process over 4 million transactions each month, showing the increasing network usage.  Active daily addresses have steadied above 30,000 since the beginning of the year, recently reaching 57,304 active addresses on February 4th. The total transaction count is now at 83.58 million. These metrics reflect the network&#8217;s ability to process a high number of transactions and its appeal to developers looking to build innovative crypto projects.  Price Targets Suggest ADA Could Reach $4 To $6 Long Term Despite the gloomy price action in the past month, these metrics point to Cardano price sentiment changing to a more favorable one. As a result, analysts predict a bullish turnaround, with one even putting a $4 to $6 price target by 2026. This represents a 730% and 1140% growth from the current price level. Related Reading: PEPE Ready To Make A Comeback? On-chain Indicators Have The Answer In a similar vein, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted a more bullish surge to $8 by January 2025, representing a 1558% surge from the current price level. Nevertheless, ADA has a lot of room to grow if Cardano can continue to attract developer and investor interest. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at $0.4825, with 44% of addresses still making a profit and 51% of addresses currently at a loss. While short-term volatility is likely and the road ahead still has obstacles, the long-term price outlook for ADA looks bright, and Cardano appears well positioned for future success in a wider crypto market bull run.  ADA price falls to $0.48 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Crypto Daily, chart from Tradingview.com"
