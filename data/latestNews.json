Binance regional manager Ben Rose shared details of the exchange’s debanking in the country at the Australian Blockchain Week on June 26. In May, the company announced that its dollar <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-suspends-aud-services\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-suspends-aud-services/amp\">services were suspended</a> after its payments provider Zepto was told to discontinue support for Binance. According to Rose, the move impacted around 1 million Australian-based customers, with Binance now seeking an alternative payment provider.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/78a38469-2dcd-4ea9-a705-e7bd2fa8a6b7.jpeg\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ben Rose (right) on stage at the Australian Blockchain Week.
