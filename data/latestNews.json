While we factored Grayscale win into our prev 65% odds, the unanimity &amp; decisiveness of ruling was beyond expectations and leaves SEC w &quot;very little wiggle room&quot; via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCStein?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCStein</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IyEGmWjuHa\">pic.twitter.com/IyEGmWjuHa</a></p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1696887691122548798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In his own post on X, Seyffart added that spot Bitcoin ETF approvals will likely be a “done deal” by Q4 2024, estimating the approval odds to have now skyrocketed to 95% by then.</p><p>Balchunas added that given the recent legal and public relations loss, a denial by the SEC will be “politically untennable.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the legal loss, there is also the PR loss (which matters bc it sets narratives, changes minds). And this got covered far and wide in mainstream media incl NYT, WSJ, CNN, AP, ABC &amp; on and on.
