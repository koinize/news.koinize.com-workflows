    "description": "<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter and Dogecoin (DOGE), is complicit in the rise to fame of the first meme coin cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Despite the crypto markets being hit by a renewed wave of meme coin speculation in recent weeks, more investors are dumping their Dogecoin (DOGE) bags to participate in other tokens like Uwerx, which have better use cases.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s find out why investors are taking this ruthless path to participate in the promising presale of Uwerx and recover their lost meme coin-laden portfolio.</p>\nDogecoin (Dogecoin): A Crypto Once Loved By All\n<p>Initially developed as a joke by two software engineers, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first ever meme coin created in 2013. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk, nicknamed the Doge Father, has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE) and continues to tweet about the meme coin until many investors caught onto the revelation, sending the token&rsquo;s price jumping on many occasions.</p>\n<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the world, having a market capitalization of over $10 billion but has fallen off the good graces of the entire crypto community. Currently having a trading volume of $169.945, 370, and trading at $0.0734, less than 90% of his all-time high price of $0.7316. </p>\n<p>In the recent wake of meme coin trading, even degen traders have shifted their attention off</p>\n<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) to focus more on new meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu(FLOKI), which are currently making all the waves in the meme coin world. Because of this, experts predict the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to reach a bare minimum of $0.095 in the last quarter of 2023.</p>\nUwerx (WERX): A Token Set To Ride The Wave And Establish Itself As The New Market Leader\n<p>Uwerx has been in every investor&rsquo;s mouth for completing their stage 1 and stage 2 presale in a record time of 17 days and 8 days, respectively.</p>\n<p>Uwerx platform is treading the least but most rewarding path of utility by offering freelancers a chance to enjoy the web3 community-first ambiance. With 5,000 registered users on the platform, they plan to expand and transform the trillion-dollar freelance economy with their hard-to-beat offerings to freelancers and clients. </p>\n<p>They are doing this by offering a wide range of benefits, like flagging a service fee of 1%, which is small compared to the 15% charged by popular freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Uwerkwill also provide more security and decentralization to the freelancers by allowing them to transact without needing a third party.</p>\n<p>Not only is Uwerx focused on creating the best freelance platform there is, but they also plan on rewarding early adopters with a test airdrop of the WERX token after the end of its presale rounds on the 31st of July. After three successful presales, the WERX token sells for $0.041 per token in its stage 5 presale.</p>\n<p>Uwerx contract has been certified by top auditing firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network, and its WERX token is currently listed on CoinSniper with pending listings on other platforms like Uniswap, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap.</p>\nUwerx (WERX) Is Set To Break Into the Bull Market In Style\n<p>Liquidity locking for a set period, renouncing contract ownership, reducing taxes to zero, and incentivizing holders are all markers for cryptos that plan on staying for the long term. These qualities will inevitably benefit Uwerx from the hyper-liquidity that will be deployed during the bull market.</p>\n<p>Strategic positioning is one of the ways to make the most out of any crypto, starting at the presale phase. You can check out the Uwerx project and join in on the presale before the price goes parabolic with these links:</p>\n<p>Join the Uwerx presale today and take advantage of the 15% presale bonus:</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">Presale: invest.uwerx.network</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">Telegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">Twitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">Website: https://www.uwerx.network/</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"s12\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/lunc-token-continues-to-surge-during-market-uncertainty-whats-behind-it/",
    "description": "Terra Classic (LUNC), the original chain left behind after the Terra Luna/UST collapse, has given a glimmer of hope to investors over the past few days. LUNC went into an uptrend amid heightened market uncertainty and bearish investor sentiment. The token has registered impressive gains over the past few days, leaving one to wonder about the reason behind such improvement.  At the time of writing, LUNC price has increased by 0.71% in the last 24 hours and 16.95% over the past seven days. High Buying Pressure Pushes LUNC Price Amid Bearish Sentiments The increased activities on the Terra Classic network are seemingly one of the factors behind LUNC&#8217;s recent price gains. Based on Coinmarketcap data, LUNC’s market capitalization and trading volume have gained 17.75% above yesterday’s value.  Related Reading: ApeCoin Holders Suffer Financial Pain As 95% Endure Negative Returns Although the price surge momentum has reduced slightly, LUNC remains among the top cryptos by trading volume. LUNC’s price increase has secured it a place among top cryptocurrencies in terms of trading volume. Other Notable Factors Behind LUNC Price Gains The price surge followed after the LUNC Burn Army shared news of the v2.1.0 upgrade proposal on June 3. The proposal&#8217;s governance vote started on June 7, while the upgrade will go live on June 14. This development generated a buzz in the LUNC community, attracting more attention to the LUNC token.  The v2.1.0 upgrade is one of the biggest events in the Terra Classic community. It aims to bring LUNC to parity with other blockchains, including Terra 2.0 and Cosmos chains. This parity will allow developers and projects to resume building on the Terra Classic Chain. The v2.1.0 upgrade adds new features and improvements to Terra Classic, including allowing a minimum of 5% commission for validators aimed at promoting fair compensation.  Also, it comes with Cosmwasm and two other security updates touted to improve the ecosystem&#8217;s security and reliability. Furthermore, the soon-coming upgrade will bring several notable changes to the Terra Classic ecosystem. The WasmVM upgrade will introduce multi-chain interoperability, extending Terra Classic’s capabilities.  Community-focused Improvement Initiatives Besides the v2.1.0 upgrade, several other community-backed initiatives are responsible for LUNC’s recent price boosts and trading volume increase. Among these is the token burn initiative, which enhances the network’s utility.  Furthermore, on June 6, the LUNC Burn Army introduced the Bug Bounty Incentive Program to foster application functionality, enhanced security, and network resilience. The Bug Bounty initiative aims to compensate ethical hackers, security researchers, and developers who identify and report security vulnerabilities.
