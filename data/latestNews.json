After two weeks, the portfolio is up around 2%, which is pretty much the same as the stock market. </p><p>Interestingly the bottom five picks lost more in percentage terms than the top five gained  Dollar Tree lost 17% after it missed earnings  so it might be more sensible in future to only invest in GPT-4s best five or 10 ideas, but well see how it works out.</p><p>The smaller-scale ChatGPT Crypto Trader account is tweaking a similar strategy that gets GPT-4s advice on when to go long on Ethereum.

Researchers from Microsoft published a 155-page paper called Sparks of General Intelligence back in March, arguing the latter was the case, apparently super <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/microsoft-ai-human-reasoning.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >impressed</a> that the GPT was clever enough to work out how to stack a book, nine eggs and a laptop on top of each other.</p><p>Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, thinks the rate of progress is set to continue, meaning we may be just a few years, maybe a decade away from AGI. But robotics researcher and AI expert Rodney Brooks argues that large language models like ChatGPT are not going to lead to AGI. He says they dont understand anything and cant logically infer meaning.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What the large language models are good at is saying what an answer should sound like, which is different from what an answer should be.” </p></blockquote><p>Another skeptic is AI writer Brian Chau, who is <a href=\"https://www.fromthenew.world/p/diminishing-returns-in-machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >writing</a> a three-part series called Diminishing returns in machine learning. He argues that AI development is bumping up against hardware limitations and the extravagant cost of training larger models and is starting to slow. He puts the chances of AGI at less than 5% by 2043</p><h2 id=\"h-chatgpt-s-loaded-dice\">ChatGPTs loaded dice</h2><p>One task thats beyond ChatGPT is rolling a die and giving you a random number. Ask it to do so, and itll invariably roll a four on its first go. Ask it for a number between one and 10, and itll pick seven. Ask it for a number between one and 30, and itll pick 17. (Bard is similarly nonrandom) One Redditor got it to roll a die 50 times, with the bot returning 31 fours, 12 threes, 4 sixes, 3 fives, and no ones or twos.” <br><br>What seems to be happening is the random numbers it produces are the ones that appear most frequently in its training data  because humans pick those same random numbers most often as well.
