The UN called this its first robot press conference. </p><p>Altogether nine robots were in attendance including Sophia, who serves as the U.N. Development Program’s (UNDP) first robot innovation ambassador, a robot healthcare service provider named Grace and a rock star robot called Desdemona.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9IN14e-PLk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The robots were able to make solid statements, some of which were pre-programmed responses. Sophia, for example, occasionally relies on scripted responses from a team of writers at Hanson Robotics, according to the company’s website. </p><p>At the conference, organizers did not clarify how much of the answers were scripted, though reporters were asked to speak “slowly and clearly” so the robots could process the questions. </p><p>When asked if AI-powered robots could govern better than humans, Sophia responded that: </p><blockquote>“I believe the humanoid robots have the potential to lead with a greater level of efficiency and effectiveness than human leaders.”</blockquote><p>She also said they don’t work with the same biases or emotions that could “cloud decision making,” along with processing large amounts of data. When challenged about learned biases and collaboration with humans she said “together we can achieve great things.”</p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-and-open-ai-sued-for-copyright-violations-sarah-silverman\"><strong><em>Sarah Silverman sues Meta and OpenAI for copyright violations</em></strong></a></p><p>When asked if humans could trust superintelligent AI systems, the robot Amica from Engineered Arts said “trust is earned not given” and as AI develops and becomes more powerful, she believes:</p><blockquote>“It's important to build trust through transparency in communication between humans and machines.”</blockquote><p>Her creator asked how we can know she would never lie to humans she answered, “no one can ever know that for sure but I can promise to always be honest and truthful with you.”</p><p>With the rise of AI, rumors and estimates of it<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-800-jobs-at-ibm-could-be-replaced-by-ai-within-years-suggests-ceo\"> replacing human labor</a> in the workforce have become more prevalent.
