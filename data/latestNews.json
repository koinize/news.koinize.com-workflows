The website’s front end is replaced by a fake update browser prompt which when clicked pulls the JavaScript payload from the Binance blockchain. </p><p>The actors frequently change the malware payloads and update website domains to evade detection. This allows them to continuously serve users fresh malware downloads disguised as browser updates, Green explained. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/c6ae8e63-6cd4-4abe-b8e5-d7b2d3fadb5e.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Screenshot of malware updates being deployed in BSC smart contract. Source: Certik </figcaption></figure><p>Another reason, according to security researchers at Web3 analytics firm 0xScope, could be because of increased security-related scrutiny on Ethereum. </p><blockquote>\"While we are unlikely to know the EtherHiding hacker's true motives for using BNB Smart Chain over other blockchains for their scheme, one possible factor is the increased security-related scrutiny on Ethereum.”</blockquote><p>Hackers may face higher risks of discovery by injecting their malicious code using Ethereum due to systems such as Infura’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-will-start-collecting-user-ip-addresses\">IP address tracking</a> for MetaMask transactions, they said. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-investors-under-attack-by-two-new-malware-reveals-cisco-talos\"><strong><em>Crypto investors under attack by new malware, reveals Cisco Talos</em></strong></a></p><p>The 0xScope team told Cointelegraph they recently tracked the money flow between hacker addresses on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum. </p><p>Key addresses were linked to NFT marketplace OpenSea users and Copper custody services, it <a href=\"https://0xscope.com/blog/Following-the-Money-on-EtherHiding-Hacks-1714610379257171968\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a>.</p><p>Payloads were updated daily across 18 identified hacker domains.
