    "description": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has been in the spotlight due to its price action. A notable crypto analyst, Pentoshi, shed light on the asset&#8217;s price trajectory, suggesting a possible uptick in value if current conditions prevail. It is worth noting that this analyst&#8217;s predictions come at a time when Ethereum¬†trails behind Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price rally. Notably, while Bitcoin has recorded a 12.5% increase over the past week, Ethereum&#8217;s gains are modest, rising by 8.4% during the same timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting ‚Äì Details Ethereum Price Bracket Significance According to the analyst&#8217;s post, Ethereum&#8217;s immediate future could see an upward trend if it manages to close the week within a specific price range. The suggested target zone, between $1,796 and $2,148, is critical, as highlighted by Pentoshi. Should ETH&#8217;s closing price fall within this bracket, the analyst posits a potential path cleared for Ethereum to reach or even surpass the $2,200 mark. While Ethereum lags Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance, the analyst remains optimistic about its prospects. Pentoshi indicates that Ethereum is approaching a &#8220;demand zone,&#8221; on the BTC/ETH ratio. Notably, this could stimulate buying activity and influence its price positively. $ETH Closing this weekly back inside the range opens up the doors to $2,200 Despite it severely underperforming BTC it&#8217;s now beginning to enter the demand zone on the btc /eth ratio BTC is bullish as long as above the 31.5-32.5k area thus I&#8217;ll continue to have bullish bias‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Hwoi8jwr2O ‚Äî Pentoshi üêß euroPeng üá™üá∫ (@Pentosh1) October 29, 2023 Bitcoin&#8217;s Bullish Standpoint Maintained Pentoshi is bullish on Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, provided it remains above a particular threshold. The $31,500 and $32,500 area is highlighted as Bitcoin&#8217;s support zone. The analyst maintains that staying above this range could sustain the positive outlook on Bitcoin. However, a dip below these levels would suggest re-evaluating this bullish analysis. Regardless, Bitcoin does not currently appear to be moving towards any support but instead seems to be pushing above any resistance.¬† In just four days, the asset has climbed from a trading price of $34,000 last Thursday to a present trading value of $34,760 at the time of writing. It‚Äôs worth noting that BTC has embarked on a significant uptrend, ascending more than 20% in the last two weeks.
