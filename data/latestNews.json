They are generally used to add supporting arguments to one side of the lawsuit, and emphasize how the case will have a broader impact beyond the involved parties. </p><p>As per the Aug. 11 <a href=\"https://t.co/QA7CjVHsLZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">filing</a> with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lummis stressed that “this is no run-of-the-mill enforcement case.” </p><p>The Senator asserted that with its lawsuit against Coinbase over <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\">alleged securities violations</a>, the SEC is pushing to obtain “primary influence” over the crypto sector at a time in which regulation and other factors are still “under active consideration by Congress and multiple agencies.” </p><blockquote>“The SEC brings this enforcement action in the midst of debates in the halls of Congress and around the world about how crypto assets should be regulated. The Constitution empowers Congress—not the SEC—to legislate in such an area of profound economic and political significance.”</blockquote><p>“Although the SEC seeks broad authority over crypto asset markets, most legislative proposals in Congress would instead grant much of that authority to other agencies. Unsatisfied, the SEC seeks to circumvent the political process to commandeer that authority for itself,” she added. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senator Cynthia Lummis (R.

The SEC cannot legislate by enforcement.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-decision-bitcoin-etfs-wont-leave-out-wall-street-giants\"><strong><em>SEC decision on Bitcoin ETFs won’t leave out Wall Street giants</em></strong></a></p><p>Lummis is not alone in filing an Amicus Brief supporting Coinbase’s motion to dismiss. </p><p>On Aug. 11, crypto advocacy groups including the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Chamber of Progress and Consumer Tech Association also submitted a joint filing. </p><p>In an X (Twitter) thread announcing the move, the Blockchain Association’s senior counsel Marisa Tashman echoed Lummis’ comments that the “SEC's regulatory authority extends only to what Congress granted it,” as she highlighted the risks of the SEC’s approach to the sector: </p><blockquote>“The SEC's interpretation threatens to sweep in many non-security assets - this can't be what Congress intended when it granted the SEC authority to regulate securities.”</blockquote><p>“The SEC takes the position that nearly all digital assets sold on the secondary market are investment contracts under the federal securities laws.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi/gmx-drops-whales-selling/",
    "description": "GMX, the native token powering GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange for trading complex crypto derivatives, is under intense selling pressure when writing on August 11. Trackers show that the governance token is down 7% on the last trading day, pushing monthly losses to 24%. This downturn has seen prices tumble close to $40, a critical support level last printed in January and June 2023.  Whales Dumping, Prices Fall Despite this setback, DeFiLlama&#8217;s data is stable as GMX&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains over $534 million. Most of the trading platform&#8217;s liquidity is locked in Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Additionally, another portion is locked on Avalanche, a fourth-generation Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The sell-off on August 11 coincides with actions by GMX &#8220;whales.&#8221; According to Lookonchain data, four whales sold 62,274 GMX worth $3 million. Address &#8220;0xb824&#8221; liquidated 19,786 GMX, translating to 514 ETH, and &#8220;0xa38a&#8221; sold 11,667 GMX for 305 ETH, losing $50,000 in the process. Meanwhile, &#8220;0X85b7&#8221; sold 20,000 GMX for 510 ETH, and &#8220;0x0b80&#8221; mirrored this move, dumping 10,820 GMX. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon Whales are selling amid a constant decline in TVL in DeFi. This contraction can be traced to the general cool-off from late 2021, when crypto prices peaked before dropping in 2022, crashing on-chain activity, especially in DeFi. At spot rates, it is changing hands at $46, an almost 50% decline from $91 registered in Q2 of 2023. Even so, the token is up nearly 4X from its all-time low. Whales&#8217; action, nonetheless, could send ripples of uncertainty throughout the GMX and DeFi communities. Crypto traders actively keep track of whale activity. Usually, when they sell, as was the case today, it could sow fear, leading others to follow suit, heaping more pressure on prices. GMX Launches v2 Beta On August 6, GMX released the v2 version in beta on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The exchange said this version introduces several enhancements, including support for more assets, including XRP. With v2, users can also utilize diverse collateral types for trading positions while trading more quickly with reduced fees and lower slippage.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange With v2, the exchange adds, is the introduction of isolated pools for liquidity providers to customize their exposure to preferred tokens. This version also incorporates augmented incentives for balancing open interest, offering a strategic avenue for hedging pools against trader profit fluctuations.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
