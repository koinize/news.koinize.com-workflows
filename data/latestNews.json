    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-open-interest-ath/",
    "description": "Ethereum has, for the most part, established a foothold above the $3,500 price level throughout the week as investors continue to anticipate a return to the $4,000 mark. Interestingly, the optimism has seen the open interest of Ethereum surging to new highs. The surge in open interest, although a bullish sentiment indicator, can also serve as a bearish signal of an impending change in market trend.  Ultimately, this metric added to the current dynamics of the Ethereum ecosystem, including regulatory uncertainty and scalability concerns hinting at a complicated price trajectory for the price of Ethereum. Ethereum Open Interest Reaches New High Open interest is an efficient method for tracking the total number of open positions in a particular contract. Recent market dynamics and institutional investor interest have seen the total open interest in Ethereum futures surging above records set in the 2021 bull market phase. Related Reading: The Bulls Are Back: Spot Bitcoin Inflows Surge With New Records According to data from Coinglass, the open interest on Ethereum futures, which has been on a surge since February 5, recently set a new high of $14.11 billion on March 15. This wasn&#8217;t particularly surprising, as a strong buying momentum from the bulls in the prior days saw the price of Ethereum surging past the $4,000 mark for the first time in two years.  However, Ethereum has since reversed from the $4,000 price level and is currently trading below $3,600. On the other hand, the total open interest on Ethereum contracts has maintained around its all-time high level, which allowed it to cross over $14.10 billion again on March 28. The open interest weighted average also went up to 0.0462%, indicating an increase in the demand for leveraged ETH long positions. The majority ($4.55 billion) in the Ethereum futures market were registered on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Bybit and OKX came in second and third, with $2.39 billion and $1.94 billion respectively. Interestingly, CME&#8217;s Ether futures also surged to $1.3 billion. At the time of writing, the CME&#8217;s Ether futures now sit at $1.31 billion, reiterating the committed bullishness among institutional investors. What’s Next For ETH? Ethereum has been trading flat since the beginning of the week and is currently on a 0.78% gain in the past seven days. All eyes are now on reports of the SEC looking into Ethereum&#8217;s security status, the industry awaits an official ruling similar to the one that was handed down in the XRP case that will finally provide clarity to the regulatory landscape.
