    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-primed-rally-1920/",
    "description": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh rally if it clears the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels. Ethereum is still struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. The price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a substantial decline if it breaks the $1,870 support. Ethereum Price Reaches Key Support Ethereum’s price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. ETH corrected lower below the $1,900 level, similar to Bitcoin. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. However, the bulls were active above the $1,870 support zone. There is also a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A proper move above the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels might send Ether toward $2,000. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,120. Any more gains above the $2,120 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,250 resistance. An intermediate resistance might be $2,200. Downside Break in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,890 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,780 in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Level – $1,870 Major Resistance Level – $1,920"
