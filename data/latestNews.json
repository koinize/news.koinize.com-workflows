    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-make-break-moment-220/",
    "description": "BNB price struggled to climb above $240 and corrected gains against the US Dollar. It is now approaching a major support zone at $220 and $215. BNB price is slowly moving lower toward the $220 support against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $225 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above $228. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Increase These past few days, BNB price saw a decent recovery wave above the key $220 resistance zone. Bitcoin rallied over 20% to $35,000 and helped BNB avoid a major downside break. The price climbed above the $225 and $230 resistance levels. However, it struggled near the $238-$240 zone. A high was formed near $237.6 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $235 level. BNB dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $208.3 swing low to the $237.6 high. It is now trading above $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $225 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $225 level. The next resistance sits near the $228 level. A clear move above the $228 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $238. A close above the $238 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $228 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $220 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $208.3 swing low to the $237.6 high. The next major support is near the $215 level or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). If there is a downside break below the $215 support, the price could drop toward the $207 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $202 level. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $220, $215, and $207. Major Resistance Levels – $225, $228, and $238."

    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has sustained an impressive bullish streak over the past week, marking a significant upward trajectory in its value. With seven out of the last eight days showing positive growth, the meme coin has not only managed to reclaim a critical low of $0.0000076 it registered in December last year, but has also encountered several notable barriers along its upward climb. In its journey through September, SHIB faced resistance from the established resistance zone and a daily bearish order block situated above $0.00000755. However, the October rally saw a significant shift, as the hurdle transformed into support, propelling the coin beyond the December low, with the current SHIB price according to CoinGecko standing at $0.0000078, indicating a 2.5% dip over the last 24 hours but still showcasing a substantial 14% surge over the past seven days.

Additionally, the analysis revealed that medium liquidation levels are concentrated within the range of $0.0000078 to $0.0000079. These findings indicate that traders and investors should closely monitor these price levels, as they serve as crucial points of interest, potentially signifying significant shifts in market sentiment and trading activity. The data suggests that these specific price points are currently important reference points in assessing the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price dynamics and potential market reactions. This information hints at the possibility of an extended pullback, potentially leading to a liquidity hunt that could drive SHIB towards the $0.0000077 mark. Source: Hyblock The medium liquidation level at $0.0000083 is a significant chart obstacle for SHIB, potentially posing a formidable challenge to any further price increases. It has historically acted as a strong resistance point, and breaking through it could be a key factor in SHIB&#8217;s future price performance. The bullish momentum of Bitcoin has the potential to be a crucial factor in helping SHIB overcome its current price obstacle, especially if Bitcoin surpasses the $35,000 mark. Bitcoin&#8217;s significant influence on the broader cryptocurrency market means that a strong Bitcoin rally could stimulate greater interest and investment in SHIB, possibly enabling it to exceed the $0.0000083 level. This highlights the interdependence of various cryptocurrencies and the impact of Bitcoin&#8217;s performance on its counterparts. SHIB seven-day price performance.

SHIB’s Growing Investor Interest Interestingly, Shiba Inu has witnessed a surge in the total number of addresses, currently reaching a new high of 3.63 million, as per data provided by IntoTheBlock. SHIB reached a market cap $4.626 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com This substantial increase in the number of addresses indicates a growing interest in SHIB among investors and traders. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data also highlights an uptick in Shiba Inu profitability, indicating that the positive price action has contributed to a favorable investment landscape for the meme coin. Shiba Inu&#8217;s recent price movements suggest a resilient and increasingly promising outlook, despite the challenges posed by key resistance levels and potential pullbacks. As Shiba Inu reverses its December downtrend, investors are eagerly watching for signs of a potential upward trend. The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s resilience and the enthusiasm of Shiba Inu&#8217;s community underline the possibility of brighter days ahead.
