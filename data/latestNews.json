The space is still fresh enough that a newcomer can get in on the ground floor of exciting new developments and take their place among industry pioneers.</p> <p>However, devs who are used to being “tech gurus” may hesitate at the threshold, uncertain where to begin their professional journey with blockchain. And there’s no doubt there’s important homework to be done before leaping in. Below, 10 members of <a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/?_ga=2.198681135.1484442309.1667485998-1927108766.1652715111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cointelegraph Innovation Circle</a> share some tips for curious developers who are new to blockchain coding and programming but want to join the growing professional community.</p> <h2>Get familiar with blockchain’s fundamental concepts</h2> <p>One tip for developers who are new to blockchain coding is to focus on understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, consensus mechanisms and smart contracts, before diving into specific programming languages or platforms. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/d44c746c-442d-4c14-bb46-c229b457455a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Irina Litchfield</a>,<a href=\"https://www.lumeria.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Lumeria</a></p> <h2>Study how transactions and the various consensus methods work</h2> <p>If you’re new to blockchain development, start by understanding the concepts of decentralization and consensus mechanisms. Blockchain isn’t just another database; it’s a paradigm shift in the way we handle and trust data. Study how transactions are added and verified on a blockchain, and learn the difference between proof of work, proof of stake and other consensus methods. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/bbcf43d3-bf13-4749-9aba-de9959380c45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Maksym Illiashenko</a>,<a href=\"http://mynftwars.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> My NFT Wars: Riftwardens</a></p> <h2>Start with one of the popular programming languages</h2> <p>Start by learning and mastering a popular and versatile blockchain programming language, such as Solidity. Focusing on a widely used language will provide a strong foundation, allow you to access numerous resources and tutorials, and facilitate collaboration with the broader blockchain development community. This will help you build the necessary skills and knowledge for successful blockchain projects. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/0d167285-44f8-41a6-9001-72aab6b4058d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Tomer Warschauer Nuni</a>,<a href=\"http://www.kryptomon.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Kryptomon</a></p> <h2>Explore open-source projects and practice writing smart contracts</h2> <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of the blockchain, learning from open-source projects and practicing writing smart contracts can lead to innovative breakthroughs, since the blockchain has almost unlimited possibilities.
