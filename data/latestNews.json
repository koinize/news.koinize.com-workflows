    "description": "<p>Prominent decentralized exchange Uniswap has confirmed that it has fired a prominent developer over his involvement in a $25,000 memecoin rug pull.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developer in question, AzFlin, or Allen Lin, orchestrated a rug pull hours after initiating the deployment of the FrensTech meme coin.&nbsp;</p>\nUniswap Moves To Fire AzFlin\n<p>Allen Lin, the Uniswap developer at the center of the storm surrounding the FrensTech meme coin rug pull, has lost his job at Uniswap. The sacking was confirmed in a post on X by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, with Uniswap moving quickly to distance themselves from the actions of their former employee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Wanted to let people know this person is no longer with the company. Not behavior we support or condone.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>AzFlin lost his job at the decentralized exchange following the FrensTech meme coin rug pull that saw investors lose 14 ETH, valued at around $25,900. The meme coin was launched on the social platform of the Coinbase Layer-2 base program, friend.tech.&nbsp;</p>\nHow The Rug Pull Was Orchestrated&nbsp;\n<p>A pseudo-anonymous user on X going by the name UniswapVillain initially made the Uniswap community aware of the fact that AzFlin had rug-pulled a meme coin project just hours after creating it. UniswapVillain noted that AzFlin initiated the rug pull by withdrawing support that was previously added to enable the trading of the FRENs token. Once the project had accumulated 14 ETH in fees, AzFlin removed liquidity and pocketed all the funds collected by the project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rug pull was orchestrated via the Hop Protocol, a decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. Furthermore, UniswapVillain added that the developer did not just remove liquidity from the project and meme coin. He also sold all the coins from which he had withdrawn the liquidity. He also added that the situation was particularly concerning, given AzFlin&rsquo;s association with Uniswap, one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Frenstech (@FrensTech) $FRENS was deployed a few hours ago by the dev, @AzFlina Uniswap employee. One hour and four minutes ago, he effectively rugged the project, moving 14 ETH off of Base chain through HOP. Multiple people have confirmed he is the dev, and there were numerous early Uniswap employee followers on Twitter. He removed liquidity he added from fees and pocketed 14 ETH of fees. He sold the tokens he removed from liquidity even. This is wild to me that someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this.&rdquo;</p>\n\nAzFlin Calls Sacking Net Neutral&nbsp;\n<p>An unremorseful AzFlin called his sacking &ldquo;net neutral,&rdquo; boasting that he had gained 600 new followers and the status of a crypto villain on X. While people have wondered why someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this, AzFlin has remained unrepentant. The bad actor simply gave an update about losing their job on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Got fired from UniSwap but gained new followers and Crypto Twitter villain status.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He also changed his bio on X, adding the words AzFlin &ldquo;Unemployment arc&rdquo; and further commented on the issue:</p>\n\n<p>\"To those who think I rugged 14E: that came from dev taxes. It belonged to me. I know whatever I say, the low IQ CT narrative has already been spun. I will not comment further on this anymore, everything is on chain.&rdquo;</p>\n\nThe Growing Menace Of Rug Pulls&nbsp;\n<p>Rug pulls have become increasingly common in the crypto space in recent times, primarily impacting newer tokens and decentralized exchanges. This comes against the backdrop of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum making record price moments that are not actionable, leaving investors desperate for a hefty profit. This is why traders should not buy into the hype of new projects and tokens pushed by influencers. Instead, they must do their own research and invest in reputable projects.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/silent-bitcoin-storm-glassnode-revelations/",
    "description": "In the dynamic realm of Bitcoin, the ability to discern patterns and trends from raw data is invaluable. Glassnode&#8217;s latest report, &#8220;Exhaustion and Apathy,&#8221; serves as a beacon, illuminating the intricate nuances of the current state of the market. Let&#8217;s delve deeper into the numbers and their implications. Historic Lows In Bitcoin Volatility The overarching theme of Glassnode&#8217;s findings is the unprecedented stagnation in Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility. The data reveals that the digital asset has been trading within a remarkably narrow $29,000 to $30,000 range. Historically, Bitcoin has been synonymous with volatility, making this current phase an anomaly. The report underscores this by highlighting the Bollinger Bands&#8217; tightness, noting, &#8220;The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%.&#8221; Such constricted movement has been a rarity in Bitcoin&#8217;s tumultuous history. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? Meanwhile, the dynamics between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH) offer a captivating narrative. Glassnode&#8217;s data indicates a significant shift in wealth between these two cohorts. The STH&#8217;s wealth has burgeoned by +$22B this year, while the LTH has witnessed a near-identical reduction of -$21B. This shift is not merely about numbers but also about market sentiment and strategy. The cost basis further elucidates this dynamic. The STH cost basis has surged by +59% YTD, settling at $28.6k. In stark contrast, the LTH cost basis lingers considerably lower, around $20.3k. This divergence suggests that recent market entrants might be paying a premium, potentially due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or speculative behavior. Glassnode&#8217;s exploration into spending patterns in this low volatility environment is also particularly enlightening. The data suggests that in such periods, the majority of coins moved on-chain have a cost basis that hews closely to the spot rate, resulting in minuscule realized profits or losses. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio, a pivotal metric in this context, is languishing at an all-time low. To put it in perspective, fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) have recorded a value lower than the current one, signaling a market teetering on the edge of a potential volatility resurgence. Segmented View Of BTC&#8217;s Supply The report&#8217;s segmented analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply, based on &#8216;investor holding time,&#8217; offers a layered understanding of market behavior. The &#8216;Hot Supply,&#8217; representing the most active coins, constitutes a mere 2.8% of all invested value in BTC. This suggests a market dominated by holders rather than traders. Related Reading: SHIB, PEPE, APE Gain Against Bitcoin, Santiment Explains What This Means The &#8216;Warm Supply,&#8217; spanning from a week to six months, has seen a modest uptick year-to-date, now accounting for around 30% of Bitcoin&#8217;s wealth. This segment&#8217;s behavior is crucial as it often acts as a bridge between short-term reactions and long-term convictions. The &#8216;Single-Cycle Long-Term Holders,&#8217; those entrenched in the 2020-23 cycle, are the behemoths, holding a staggering 63% of the invested capital. Their cost basis, as per Glassnode, stands at $33.8k, indicating an average unrealized loss of -13.3%. In juxtaposition, the classic LTH cohort, which includes the long-dormant and deep HODLed supply, boasts a cost basis of $20.4k, translating to an unrealized profit of +43.6%. This stark contrast underscores the lingering impact of the 2022 bear market and the cautious optimism of early adopters. In conclusion, Glassnode&#8217;s data-driven insights paint a nuanced picture of the Bitcoin market. The dominance of long-term holders, the historic lows in volatility, and the evident investor apathy all converge to suggest a market in a state of stasis. The numbers indicate a market that&#8217;s waiting, perhaps for a Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? or a significant event, to determine its next direction. At press time, Bitcoin was trading just above the 50-day EMA. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"
