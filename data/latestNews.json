    "description": "Finder’s board of crypto market experts has predicted a positive long-term increase in the price of Ethereum in 2023, 2025, and 2030.  Ethereum To Surpass $14,000 By 2030? The price of Ethereum has been on a fairly positive sentiment since the news of BlackRock’s Ethereum Spot ETF filing news. The cryptocurrency saw a spike that took its price above $2000 this week.  Industry specialists from Finder, an independent comparison platform and information service have stated that Ethereum will continue experiencing a price increase in the coming years.  Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Revenue Soars To A 4-Month High Of $10 Million The comparison platform has predicted that Ethereum would drop to $1,840 by the end of 2023 and Ethereum’s price at the time of writing is $2,060.8. Crypto specialists at Finder also expect Ethereum’s value to increase to $5,824 by 2025 and $14,411 by 2030. The financial information service platform has stated that the reason for this price prediction is due to Ethereum’s huge growth potential and the increasing demand for Ethereum staking.  Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,060. Chart: TradingView.com Lead Market Analyst at Swyftx, Pav Hundal has supported Ethereum&#8217;s price increase prediction. Hundal stated that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 may push the cryptocurrency’s price up, as historical patterns have suggested a potential upward movement for Ethereum’s value during past Bitcoin halving events.  “Historically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year. This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalization) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving,” Hundal stated.  Finder Experts Say BTC Still Holds Upper Hand Despite the positive outlook of Ethereum’s price in the future by Finder’s crypto experts, a large majority of Finder’s specialists have expressed skepticism about Ethereum&#8217;s market capitalization surpassing that of Bitcoin.  When asked if they saw ETH’s market cap “flipping” BTCs, 43% of the expert panelists remained unconvinced that Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin.  Creator of Seasonal Tokens, Ruadhan O. has stated that he believed that Ethereum’s utility surpassed Bitcoin’s however he does not see ETH’s market cap surpassing BTC’s. He explained that his reasons were due to Ethereum’s high competition with other altcoins in the crypto market.  Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook: Expert Forecasts Potential Rise To $5.5 &#8220;Ethereum remains expensive to use [and] it will lose market share to cheaper alternatives. Bitcoin isn&#8217;t useful. Nobody needs a Bitcoin. There&#8217;s no demand for Bitcoin&#8217;s utility at a lower price because there&#8217;s no utility. This is why Bitcoin isn&#8217;t losing market share to other proof-of-work coins,” O stated.  Featured image from Shutterstock"
