Some are discussing the creation of new currencies for international trade, while others are buying an increasing amount of gold to diversify their reserve. </p><p>Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), a nascent asset with many of the characteristics of gold, may also benefit from this trend in the long run. </p><p>To know more about the causes and implications of the U.S. dollar decline and the assets that will benefit from it, watch the latest Cointelegraph Report on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!</p></p>\n                \n            "
