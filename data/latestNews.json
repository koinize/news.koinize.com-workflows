    "description": "Optimism (OP), a prominent Layer 2 network, is experiencing a noticeable decline in network activity as the hype surrounding meme coins takes a dip. Once bustling with vibrant transactions and a fervent community, Optimism now faces a subdued atmosphere as users shift their attention away from these speculative assets.  The decrease in meme coin fervor has had a direct impact on the overall engagement within the Optimism network, prompting questions about its long-term viability and adaptability in an ever-changing crypto landscape. Can the Layer 2 network adapt to evolving market trends and sustain its relevance in the face of shifting investor preferences? Declining OP Price And Network Activity Raise Concerns The price of OP on CoinGecko is currently at $1.29, indicating a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. However, despite this recent downturn, the coin has managed to sustain a seven-day rally of 1.5%, suggesting potential resilience and market support. Source: Coingecko Nevertheless, Optimism, the Layer 2 network housing decentralized exchanges (DEXes), has witnessed a significant decrease in daily on-chain transaction volume, leading to a concerning 59% decline over the past week. A new OP price report reveals a decline in network activity on the OP Mainnet since mid-June. The number of unique wallet addresses involved in daily on-chain transactions has exhibited a downward trend during this period. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why As of July 2, there were 81,480 daily active addresses, representing a 45% decrease over the past three weeks. Source: Artemis These declining network activity figures raise questions about the future prospects of Optimism and its ability to attract and retain users in the face of changing market dynamics. Implications Of Waning Meme Coin Craze On Optimism Network The decline in network activity on Optimism can also be attributed to the waning craze surrounding meme coins, which have captivated the cryptocurrency market in recent months.  Meme coins, characterized by their humorous and often whimsical nature, gained immense popularity as investors sought quick and potentially lucrative investments. However, as the initial hype around meme coins fade, users are now shifting their attention towards other crypto assets, resulting in a noticeable decline in engagement on the Optimism network. OP market cap currently at $833 million. Chart: TradingView.com The implications of this shift in investor sentiment are significant for Optimism and its long-term viability. The network heavily relied on the surge of meme coin activity to drive transactions and foster a vibrant community. Can Optimism Win Back User Interest? With the decline in meme coin hype, Optimism now faces the challenge of retaining and attracting users who are seeking alternative avenues for potential gains.  Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price?
