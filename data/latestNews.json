The report, released on November 15, looked back at the history of crypto exploits in 2022, categorizing them into different types of vulnerabilities. It <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.ctfassets.net%2Ft3wqy70tc3bv%2F49ZvJaptCz8KMohM4Cjskm%2F93a55ebf17bd9298ff42337bfdf12122%2FImmunefi_Report_The_True_Origin_Of_Hacks___Top_Web3_Vulnerabilities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">concluded</a> that a full 46.48% of the crypto lost from exploits in 2022 was not from smart contract flaws but was rather from “infrastructure weaknesses” or issues with the developing firm’s computer systems.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/40d01c87-4998-45fd-88cf-d57441d4dedf.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Categories of Web3 vulnerabilities. Source: Immunefi.</em></figcaption></figure><p>When considering the number of incidents instead of the value of crypto lost, Web2 vulnerabilities were a smaller portion of the total at 26.56%, although they were still the second-largest category.</p><p>Immunefi’s report excluded exit scams or other frauds, as well as exploits that occurred solely because of market manipulations. It only considered attacks that occurred because of a security vulnerability. Of these, it found that attacks fall into three broad categories. First, some attacks occur because the smart contract contains a design flaw. Immunefi <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-confirms-bsc-halt-due-to-potential-exploit\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-confirms-bsc-halt-due-to-potential-exploit/amp\">cited the BNB Chain bridge hack</a> as an example of this type of vulnerability. Second, some attacks occur because, even though the smart contract is designed well, the code implementing the design is flawed. Immunefi <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/qubit-finance-suffers-80-million-loss-following-hack\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/qubit-finance-suffers-80-million-loss-following-hack/amp\">cited the Qbit hack</a> as an example of this category.</p><p>Finally, a third category of vulnerability is “infrastructure weaknesses,” which Immunefi defined as “the IT-infrastructure on which a smart contract operates—for example virtual machines, private keys, etc.” As an example of this type of vulnerability, Immunefi <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-s-ronin-bridge-hacked-for-over-600m\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-s-ronin-bridge-hacked-for-over-600m/amp\">listed the Ronin bridge hack</a>, which was caused by an attacker gaining control of 5 out of 9 Ronin nodes validator signatures.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-dao-debate-shows-devs-still-struggle-to-secure-cross-chain-bridges\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-dao-debate-shows-devs-still-struggle-to-secure-cross-chain-bridges/amp\"><strong>Uniswap DAO debate shows devs still struggle to secure cross-chain bridges</strong></a></em></p><p>Immunefi broke down these categories further into subcategories. When it comes to infrastructure weaknesses, these can be caused by an employee leaking a private key (for example, by transmitting it across an insecure channel), using a weak passphrase for a key vault, problems with 2-factor authentication, DNS hijacking, BGP hijacking, a hot wallet compromise, or using weak encryption methods and storing them in plaintext.</p><p>While these infrastructure vulnerabilities caused the greatest amount of losses compared to other categories, the second-largest cause of losses was “cryptographic issues” such as Merkle tree errors, signature replayability, and predictable random number generation. Cryptographic issues resulted in 20.58% of the total value of losses in 2022. </p><p>Another common vulnerability was “weak/missing access control and/or input validation,” the report stated. This type of flaw resulted in only 4.62% of the losses in terms of value, but it was the largest contributor in terms of the number of incidents, as 30.47% of all incidents were caused by it.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "
