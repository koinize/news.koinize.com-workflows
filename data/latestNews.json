The proposed new industry guidelines are intended to address these issues, and the EBA has given interested parties until Feb. 26, 2024 to comment. </p><p>In particular, the EBA suggests merging the AML/CFT criteria for payment service providers (PSPs) and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). It also proposes to oblige CASPs to “enable the transmission of information in a seamless and interoperable manner” by enhancing the interoperability of their protocols. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-tech-coalition-warns-of-over-regulating-ai-prior-to-eu-ai-act-finalization\"><strong><em>EU tech coalition warns of over-regulating AI before EU AI Act finalization</em></strong></a></p><p>Under the proposed new rules, CASPs will also be required to obtain and hold information on self-hosted addresses, ensure that the transfer of crypto-assets can be individually identified and verify whether that address is owned or controlled by the CASP customer. These requirements would be enforced when the transfer amount of the self-hosted account is above the 1000 euro mark, although the EBA doesn’t specify whether this is a monthly, daily or a single-time mark. </p><p>After the consultation process, the new guidelines should come into force on Dec. 30, 2024. </p><p>Last month, the EBA released a consultation paper assessing the suitability of management body members and shareholders or members holding qualifying stakes in issuers of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/asset-tokenization\">asset-referenced tokens</a> (ARTs) and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-asset-segregation-how-crypto-asset-management-works\">crypto asset service</a> providers (CASPs). </p><p>In July, the Authority encouraged stablecoin issuers to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-banking-authority-calls-for-early-adoption-of-stablecoin-standards\">voluntarily adhere to specific “guiding principles</a>” related to risk management and consumer protection. </p><p><strong><em><u>Magazine: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-substance-abuse-traders-trading/\"><strong><em>This is your brain on crypto.
