I have been assured by all the stakeholders and the ministries concerned that by December we will be able to launch digital IDs.”</blockquote><p>Digital IDs will be introduced in the country along with Maisha Namba, a system of lifelong personal identification numbers assigned to Kenyan citizens upon registration. The joint ID system will help the country to digitalize its registries and provide citizens with swifter access to state, educational and medical resources. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kenya-investigate-worldcoin\"><strong><em>Kenya forms parliamentary committee to investigate Worldcoin</em></strong></a></p><p>As the Principal Secretary of Immigration and Citizen Services, Julius Bitok <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliusKBitok/status/1690999348094533632?t=PJ5YIyQUgD6AgOngqGTy-w&amp;s=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">explained</a> in August:</p><blockquote>“The digital identity system will provide Kenyans with a secure and reliable way to verify their identity for a variety of purposes, including accessing gov’t services, opening bank accounts, and traveling [...] It will also help to reduce fraud and corruption, and improve efficiency.”</blockquote><p>In September, Bitok urged private businesses to <a href=\"https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/realtime/2023-09-25-bitok-urges-businesses-to-embrace-digital-id-to-beat-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">embrace</a> the digital ID systems, as they “enable innovative solutions like mobile banking and agent networks, transforming e-commerce processes.” He promised that the government will ensure the design of the digital ID will “facilitate commerce and ease business transactions.”</p><p>In June 2023, the Central Bank of Kenya <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-may-not-be-a-compelling-priority-says-kenya-s-central-bank\">expressed its doubts</a> about the necessity to implement the central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the short to medium term, referring to “other innovative solutions around the existing ecosystem” that could address Kenya’s “pain points” in payment. </p><p><strong><em><u>Magazine: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/cuba-bitcoin-revolution-adoption-embargo/\"><strong><em>The Truth Behind Cuba’s Bitcoin Revolution: An on-the-ground report</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

The value fluctuation of cryptocurrencies is one major obstacle. The ability of aid organizations to make effective plans and resource allocations might be impacted by price fluctuations. Careful financial techniques, such as instantaneous conversion to local currencies, are required to prevent losses resulting from market swings in order to alleviate this.</p><p>The digital divide in areas impacted by humanitarian crises is another issue. There are concerns regarding inclusion because not all beneficiaries may have access to the technology needed to use cryptocurrency. Aid groups need to think about other approaches and make sure that everyone may receive aid, regardless of their technological capacity.</p><p>The most important thing to consider while handling crypto transactions is cybersecurity. Cryptocurrencies’ decentralized and pseudonymous structure makes them vulnerable to hacking and scams by unscrupulous people. Strong security measures are essential to preserve money and keep beneficiaries and aid groups safe. Examples of such measures include encrypted wallets and secure transaction protocols.</p><p>Global legal systems and regulatory difficulties also vary. While some nations have welcomed cryptocurrencies, others have enacted stringent laws or outright banned them. Careful planning and adherence are necessary while navigating these varied legal environments to prevent legal issues and guarantee the legitimacy of aid activities. </p><p>Although they provide protection and privacy, cryptocurrencies also raise issues related to accountability and transparency. It’s critical to strike a balance between donor privacy and the transparency required for relief agencies and donors to monitor fund utilization. One way to resolve this moral conundrum is to implement transparent blockchain platforms that permit public inspection while safeguarding private data.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-18396-2\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Benefits of blockchain for charitable giving            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>Blockchain for charitable giving revolutionizes the sector by providing unprecedented transparency, efficiency and security. </em></p><p>Every transaction related to charity is made publicly available and recorded thanks to the decentralized and unchangeable ledger powered by <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know\">blockchain technology</a>. By ensuring that donations are being used as intended, this transparency fosters trust and boosts confidence in nonprofit organizations.</p><p>Moreover, by streamlining the donation process, blockchains lower administrative expenses and guarantee that a larger percentage of donations go straight to the intended recipients. By automating transactions when predetermined criteria are satisfied, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements\">smart contracts</a> — self-executing instructions on the blockchain — eliminate intermediaries and speed up the movement of funds. </p><p>Additionally, by enabling quick and affordable international transactions, blockchain permits gifts to be made without borders. The reach of charity endeavors is expanded by this accessibility, which enables organizations to connect with a worldwide pool of prospective donors.</p><p>Furthermore, interactive awareness campaigns may utilize a series of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world\">nonfungible tokens (NFTs)</a> that could educate people while raising funds by telling a story about the cause. Additionally, organizing challenges or competitions where participants create and submit NFTs relevant to the cause can raise donations through the sale of the winning NFTs.</p><p>Blockchain technology also improves data integrity and security. Blockchain’s cryptographic structure guarantees that once information is recorded, it cannot be changed without the consent of network members. The integrity of the entire nonprofit ecosystem is ensured by this immutability, which protects gift records and deters fraud. Because blockchain offers more transparency and lowers the risk of fraud, it not only draws in more contributions but also promotes consistent and long-term involvement with philanthropic projects.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-18396-1\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Understanding blockchain-based philanthropy            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>By utilizing blockchain technology, blockchain-based philanthropy, commonly referred to as crypto philanthropy, transforms charitable giving. </em></p><p>Blockchain-powered charity basically entails leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms to carry out charity activities and make donations. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digitizing-charity-we-can-do-better-at-doing-good\">Blockchain-based philanthropy</a>, in contrast to conventional methods, ensures unrivaled transparency and security.

Binance Charity is the charitable division of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which has been actively involved in a number of charitable endeavors. It concentrates on leveraging blockchain technology to provide accountable, effective and transparent philanthropy.</p><p>The Giving Block facilitates the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments by charity organizations. Even though it may not be a platform for charitable giving itself, it helps many nonprofits receive cryptocurrency donations, making cryptocurrencies more widely available for philanthropic giving.</p>            </p>        </div>                    <div data-ct-widget=\"explained-block\" id=\"explained-block-18396-0\">            <h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Challenges in traditional charity systems and the need for blockchain-based fundraising            </h2>            <p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                <p><em>The drawbacks of conventional charity systems, including limited visibility, high transaction fees and slow transaction processing, can be addressed by technologies like blockchain, which offer transparency, lower transaction costs and quick fund transfers.</em></p><p>There are various challenges that traditional charity systems must overcome to function effectively. The lack of transparency in the distribution and use of funds is one of the main problems. There is often limited visibility for donors regarding the use of their contributions, raising questions about possible mismanagement or inefficiencies. This could discourage prospective contributors from making a contribution, which would reduce the total amount of money available for charity endeavors.</p><p>Also, donations have less impact when financial intermediaries charge high transaction fees. These fees, which are typical of old systems, reduce the total amount that is available for charitable initiatives, thereby reducing their efficacy.</p><p>Moreover, delivery of vital help is delayed by slow transaction times, particularly with foreign donations. These delays can hinder emergency response operations and negatively impact the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.</p><p>In response to these challenges, innovative solutions like blockchain-based fundraising platforms have emerged. By using a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-are-changing-philanthropy-expert-take\">decentralized ledger to maintain transparency</a>, they enable contributors to monitor their contributions in real time. Furthermore, blockchain transactions are cheaper and faster, making it possible for charitable organizations to move money quickly and affordably, enabling them to deploy funds effectively and on time.</p>            </p>        </div>    </p>\n                \n            "
