    "description": "<p>The waitlist for the integration of a self-custody wallet TON Space within Telegram Messenger is now available for developers.</p>\nMerging Web2 and Web3\n<p>On Wednesday, August 9, the TON, a blockchain system originally created by Telegram, announced the launch of its self-custodial crypto wallet TON Space that would be integrated in the prominent messaging app. The product is now in its beta phase and available for developers only.</p>\n<p>By applying for the beta version of TON Space, developers will have a chance to integrate the wallet into their apps before everyone else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TON Space aims at facilitating the Web3 adoption by offering the whole user experience entirely within Telegram Messenger. Developers will be able to build their apps, integrate the blockchain, and unboard their users without leaving the platform.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The developers&rsquo; beta is a critical moment in launching the first self-custodial wallet built into a thriving Web2 platform,&rdquo; said Jordan Dunne, Head of DeFi at Wallet. &ldquo;The introduction of TON Space will allow blockchain developers to build Web3 services that feel like the intuitive mobile app experiences users have every day. Easy-to-use and all without ever leaving Telegram, with 800 million users every month, this opens up a staggering growth opportunity for builders.&rdquo;</p>\n\nMain Features of TON Space\n<p>As a self-custody wallet, TON Space will provide its users with full control over their assets, allowing them to store, trade, and manage crypto within Telegram. One of the unique advantages of TON Space is that it can be seamlessly linked to any app built on Telegram, all integrated within a single ecosystem. According to the press release, TON Space is the most highly anticipated feature among the users who wish to have full access to the TON network within Telegram Messenger.</p>\n<p>The custodial wallet is expected to open for consumer use by the end of Q3 2023. The team also plans to integrate NFT collectables and swapping services into the product by that time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The launch of TON Space is a significant milestone that establishes a new infrastructure layer for the TON ecosystem,&rdquo; commented Justin Hyun, Director of Growth at TON Foundation. &ldquo;The power to build decentralized applications and bots fully integrated inside of Telegram cannot be underestimated. These services, and their users, will now enjoy the infinite possibilities that come with the power to store, manage, and trade assets within Telegram.&rdquo;</p>\n\nTelegram vs Twitter?\n<p>By integrating the crypto wallet, Telegram, which has always had an unwavering emphasis on privacy and security, is now officially entering the Web3 space. The move makes the global messenger a key player in the industry, which could potentially compete with such giants as X (previously known as Twitter), recently bought and rebranded by Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "The Shanghai upgrade was one of the most anticipated blockchain events of 2023, expected to introduce a higher level of speed and scalability to the Ethereum network. However, the most important feature of the Shanghai upgrade was allowing validators and stakers to finally withdraw their staked ETH from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. To explain, the Beacon Chain was created to aid the smooth transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work consensus model to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, i.e., ETH 2.0.¬†Since its launch in 2020, many users have been staking their ETH tokens on the Beacon chain to facilitate network security and earn rewards. Albeit, those assets and the rewards they generate were inaccessible until after the Shanghai upgrade in 2023.¬† Prior to this network upgrade which occurred on April 12, 2023, the total number of staked ETH stood at 18.1 million, according to data by Dune Analytics. Four months later, the token analytics website Token Unlocks has offered more insight into how the Shanghai Upgrade has impacted the ETH staking activity so far. Related Reading: Ethereum: Historical Playbook Points To $3,800 In Coming Months Shanghai Upgrade Sparks Confidence In ETH Staking¬† On August 10, Token Unlocks posted on social media platform X that the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has yielded a positive result on ETH staking, with a significant rise in demand for LSD protocols &#8211; a liquid staking aggregator project designed to promote maximum yields for ETH stakers.¬† üî• Wrapped Up for Shanghai Upgrade üî• The Shanghai Upgrade fueled sector growth, and the demand for the LSD protocol keeps rising. Here&#8217;s what you can&#8217;t afford to miss: üîê 22.99m $ETH staked, ~18.86% of circulation (Overall) ‚úÖ 5.84m $ETH staked, ~4.8% of circulation (Since‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ZReOpNVTzD ‚Äî Token Unlocks (@Token_Unlocks) August 10, 2023 According to the report by Token Unlocks, there are currently 22.99 million staked ETH on the Ethereum network, accounting for about 18.86% of ETH‚Äôs circulating supply. The report also highlights that 25% of this currently staked ETH was staked after the Shanghai upgrade in April. This means that about 5.84 million ETH, constituting about 4.8% of ETH circulating supply, has been staked in the last four months. To emphasize the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on ETH staking, Token Unlocks noted that the net ETH staking ratio is up by 147%, with about 9.82 million ETH deposited and only 3.97 million ETH withdrawn post-upgrade. It is worth stating that there were some speculations that the Shanghai upgrade would lead to a large-scale withdrawal of ETH, which could negatively affect the crypto market. Interestingly, the report above paints a different reality, with many users now willing to stake ETH as they have the freedom to withdraw at will.¬† ETH trading at $1,856.8 on the hourly chart &#124; Source: ETHUSD chart on Tradingview.com ETH Elites Strengthen Grip On Coin Supply In other news, on-chain analytics firm Santiment reports a wealth accumulation trend in the ETH market. According to Santiment, the top 10 ETH addresses have significantly increased their ETH holdings in the last five years. Within this period, the market intelligence firm notes that these wallets have acquired 27.86 million ETH, increasing their holdings from 11.2% to 34.6% of the token‚Äôs supply.
