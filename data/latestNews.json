The price has risen above $40,000 again, but some analysts expect the bleeding to continue. Chris Burniske, partner at crypto venture capital firm Placeholder, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that he would not be surprised to see <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exec-20k-btc-price-before-new-all-time-highs\">Bitcoin drop to mid-to-high 20,000 levels</a> before a bottom is made.</p><p>One of the major reasons for Bitcoin’s recent fall has been the massive liquidations in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). However, JPMorgan analysts said in a Jan. 25 market report that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gbtc-sell-off-to-stem-jpmorgan-bitcoin-etfs-record-net-outflows\">bulk of the profit taking in GBTC</a> has “happened already,” meaning “most of the downward pressure on Bitcoin from that channel should be largely behind us.”</p><p>Every bull market has its share of corrections, which helps shake out the weak hands and allow the stronger hands to buy at lower levels. During a correction, waiting for a support level to be established before buying is generally a good strategy.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-analysis-1-26-btc-eth-bnb-sol-xrp-ada-avax-doge-dot-link\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
