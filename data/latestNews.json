The clawback seeks $39 million worth of ETH earned from the launch of Azuki’s controversial “Elementals” collection. It proposes to allocate any funds retrieved back to the DAO to “promote the growth of the entire Azuki community.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e9bf33f8-0313-46e4-98a2-c5d620d2bf68.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The AzukiDAO proposal seeks to claw back $39 million from Zagabond.

A small allocation of the 20,000 NFTs was airdropped to select Azuki holders.</p><p>The remaining NFTs became available for purchase at 4 pm on June 27. Existing holders of Azuki NFTs and holders of “BEANZ” — another derivative project — were given a 20-minute pre-sale window. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/secret-service-reveals-more-about-its-nft-collection\"><strong><em>Yes, the Secret Service has an NFT collection, and no, it’s not for sale</em></strong></a></p><p>The sale never went public, as the entire collection was snapped up in private sales in under 15 minutes.

Source: OpenSea</em></figcaption></figure><p>This drew widespread backlash, with grievances ranging from the small pre-sale window, to mint failures from an overloaded website, and the lack of originality in the new NFTs art.</p><p>NFT holders also expressed their concern that releasing 20,000 new NFTs would dilute the value of pre-existing NFTs in the collection. The controversy reached its peak when the project team reportedly transferred 20,000 ETH from the wallet soon after the collection was minted out. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/4-out-of-10-nft-sales-are-fake-learn-to-spot-the-signs-of-wash-trading/\"><strong><em>4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
