Meanwhile, several stable pools on Curve Finance were exploited on July 30 due to a reentrancy vulnerability in certain versions of the Vyper programming language. Losses topped $52 million, leading to a plummeting of Curve’s native CRV token. Amid the chaos, an ethical hacker managed to retrieve $5.4 million worth of Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) from an exploiter and returned it to the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance\">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> protocol. </p><h2>Hex founder faces SEC complaint over unregistered securities offering</h2><p>Controversial crypto entrepreneur and investor Richard Heart faces a lawsuit from federal regulators over an alleged unregistered securities offering. </p><p>In a July 31 filing, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that Heart had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-files-complaint-hex-founder-offering-unregistered-securities\">raised more than $1 billion</a> through the unlawful sale of Hex, PulseChain (PLS) and PulseX (PSLX). According to the complaint, Heart made claims of “grandiose wealth for investors” in marketing the tokens. The Hex founder faces charges related to federal securities violations and defrauding retail investors. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we charged Richard Heart (aka Richard Schueler) and three unincorporated entities that he controls, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX, with conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities that raised more than $1 billion in crypto assets from investors.</p>&mdash; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1686042971190272000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Like other crypto assets, Hex surged in popularity in 2021, reaching an all-time high around $0.48.
