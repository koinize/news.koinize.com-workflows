However, a DeFi narrative is building around <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/defis-next-big-thing-liquid-staking-derivatives#:~:text=LSDs%20are%20a%20relatively%20new,staked%20cryptocurrency%2C%20such%20as%20ETH.\">liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens</a> that could revive Ethereum’s network activity.</p><p>The percentage of gas consumed by DeFi protocols has dropped from 34% in 2020 to 8% to 16% presently, with NFTs commanding the maximum share of 25% to 30%, according to a recent <a href=\"https://insights.glassnode.com/defi-downtrend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a> from Glassnode.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/0473f74f-5f7f-4b33-93bb-d2e80526f7f2.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ethereum gas usage by transaction type.

Source: glassnode</em></figcaption></figure><p>The DeFi blue chip tokens have underperformed ETH during bullish market rallies and experienced a more severe drop than ETH “on the downside during the bear.” The analysts predict that since staking of ETH now yields 4%, it will act as a “new hurdle rate over which token returns must jump.” This yield represents the benchmark rate for ether investors.</p><p>Currently, leading lending protocols like Aave and Compound offer between 2-3% yields on lending stablecoins and ether. Moreover, DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound also come with smart contract risk which is eliminated with proof-of-stake (PoS) validators.</p><p>Staking has become popular among Ethereum investors, especially after the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which enabled redemptions from the staking contract.</p><p>By the end of May, Ethereum users staked 21.63 million ETH worth $40.021 billion, representing 18% of Ethereum’s total supply.</p><p>LSD platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool account for one third of this massive market. These applications offer tokenized representation of staked ETH, allowing investors access to the staking yields without compromising liquidity.</p><p>A growing trend among Ethereum investors is interacting with LSD-fi or LSD financialization, which aims to put the liquidity offered by the LSD tokens to use in DeFi applications.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/lsd-for-defi-tenet-layerzero-partner-to-drive-cross-chain-liquid-staking-adoption\"><strong><em>LSD for DeFi: Tenet, LayerZero partner to drive cross-chain liquid staking adoption</em></strong></a></p><h2>Is LSDfi the solution?</h2><p>Essentially, LSDfi leverages the liquidity of LSD tokens into DeFi like lending protocols and liquidity on exchanges for higher yields. Given that a considerable amount of ETH is staked with the LSD platforms, LSDfi has the potential to revive DeFi activity.</p><p>A Dune analytics dashboard by data analyst Defimochi shows the total value locked (TVL) in LSDfi protocols has touched $411 million, rising exponentially since mid-May. Some of the popular names in the sector are Pendle Finance, Lybra Finance, Curve Finance and Alchemix Protocol.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/75b01ca4-6af0-4bc5-95d2-64490d7a9248.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LSDfi total value locked.
