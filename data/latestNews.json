This means that users must transfer USDC from their Circle Account to an external Polkadot Asset Hub wallet address prior to using XCM.</p><p>When transferring USDT from Polkadot Asset Hub to other parachains via XCM, users must transfer back to Polkadot Asset Hub via XCM prior to depositing into their Circle Account, Circle said, adding:</p><blockquote>“Please do not attempt to deposit XCM-transferred USDC from a parachain other than Polkadot Asset Hub to your Circle Account, as it may not be recoverable and could result in a loss of funds.”</blockquote><p>Polkadot support on USDC is yet another addition to the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. With the latest addition, USDC now supports a total of 14 various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Tron, Stellar, Solana and others.</p><p>Similarly to other blockchain integrations, the latest integration with Polkadot aims to maintain Circle as a major interoperable cryptocurrency as well as support low cost payments. The addition of Polkadot features trading, borrowing and lending on parachains like Centrifuge, HydraDX and Moonbeam.</p><p>Launched in 2020, Polkadot is a network of multiple independent blockchains, also referred to as parachains. Such blockchains operate in parallel with each other to allow for faster transactions while benefiting from Polkadot’s overall security and decentralization.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-dai-depegged-more-than-usdt-sp-global-research\"><strong><em>Stablecoin depegging plagued USDC and DAI more than others: Analysts</em></strong></a></p><p>The number of blockchains supported by USDC is now higher than the number of networks supported by rival stablecoin USDT, which <a href=\"https://tether.to/en/why-tether/#:~:text=Tether%20tokens%20are%20built%20on,%2C%20Solana%2C%20TRON%20and%20Tezos.&amp;text=Tether%20tokens%20are%20among%20the,daily%20volume%2C%20offering%20unequalled%20liquidity.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">supports</a> a total of 11 networks at the time of writing.
