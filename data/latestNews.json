Thanks to the games open-ended gameplay, there is tons of community-built content available to enjoy.</p><p>Have you finished the standard content of the game? Then why not relive the industrial revolution with custom-built mods? Or enter a competition to see who can build a construction first against hundreds of others? There is a server for that.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/mkr/maker-mkr-records-higher-gains-as-market-turns-red-whats-behind-it/",
    "description": "The crypto market swiftly turned bearish from yesterday&#8217;s scarcely bullish outlook, and top coins have receded farther from their new-found support. But interestingly, MarkerDao’s MKR appears unperturbed by the market’s gloomy sentiment as MKR soared higher with massive gains, adding over 17% to its value on the day.  MKR Price Outlook Over the last day, the MRK token has witnessed several steep rise and fall. The digital asset reached a day-high of $1,203 at 2:30 am UTC on July 21, a 20% increase from its July 20 opening price. Related Reading: Best Bitcoin Roulette Sites And Crypto Roulette Games MKR had lost momentum shortly after the $1,203 peak spike, falling to $1,134. However, it continued the fluctuations before regaining momentum for a more bullish rise. At the time of writing, Maker&#8217;s price is changing hands at $1,162, with a 17.63% 24-hour price increase.  Maker’s current price is 26% higher than its value seven days ago and it may surpass $1,200 if it sustains the current bullish rally. A close look at MKR’s sudden price resurgence suggests the token might be riding on some other bullish waves. Possible Reasons Behind Maker’s Sudden Price Surge Maker&#8217;s dramatic price surge may be due to recent developments in the MakerDAO ecosystem. On-chain sleuth, Lookonchain, reported some conspicuous activities by top VC firms Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z and CMS Holdings, which are suspected to be responsible for the price surge. According to the report, a16z recently deposited large chunks of Maker tokens to Coinbase. The venture capital company deposited 12,864 MKR tokens worth approximately $12.6 million at the time.  The firm also reportedly transferred another 6,900 MKR, worth $8 million by today’s exchange rates, to a new address, presumably with plans to deposit the funds on an exchange. Currently, a16z holds around 12,396 MKR tokens worth ~$14.4 million. Also, Lookonchain reported that CMS, a blockchain-focused private investment company, reduced its recently acquired MKR holdings. CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR tokens worth $614,000 to Binance two hours before the sharp price surge. CMS previously withdrew 1,325 Maker tokens worth $1.54 million from Binance and Bitget at an average price of $793. The investment firm now holds 800 MKR, worth approximately $936,000. Implications Of a16z And CMS Holding’s Activities The unprecedented change in the token holdings of these top market players must have significantly contributed to the token&#8217;s price spike. The market positively reacted to the massive MKR sales, leading to increased trading volume and price surge. The sharp spike in MKR’s price can be interpreted this way: the trading activity of institutional investors like a16z and CMS Holdings draws more attention to Maker. The renewed interest could bring new buyers, exerting more demand pressure on the token and causing the price to spike further.

This potentially bodes badly for MKR as it could depress investor sentiment, causing massive selloffs which might push the price down. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink-holds-strong-with-19-rally-more-gains-in-the-pipeline/",
    "description": "Chainlink (CHAIN) has recently experienced a surge in its short-term price action, delivering considerable gains to its holders. The excitement surrounding this upward momentum has been palpable, but astute observers have noticed some intriguing indications that suggest this hike might not necessarily signify the peak for LINK.  Such a notion is not mere speculation; instead, it finds its foundation in the actions of LINK holders and the patterns observed in trading activity. These compelling insights offer a glimpse into the future trajectory of Chainlink and its possibilities. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 LINK Price Surge Fueled By Increased Accumulation, Network Activity LINK&#8217;s recent price surge has been underpinned by a significant token accumulation and notable activity on the Chainlink network. According to a LINK price report referencing Santiment data, the number of addresses holding between 0 to 1 million LINK has seen an incredible increase, potentially playing a pivotal role in driving the token&#8217;s value. Source: Santiment Coingecko data shows LINK registering an impressive $8.33 price, and a remarkable 24-hour rally of 19.0%. In the last week, the crypto has risen 15.0% in value. Source: Coingecko However, the surge appears far from an isolated event, as the accumulation rate has shown no signs of slowing down. Such consistent accumulation often suggests a growing conviction among investors and traders that LINK&#8217;s value may be on the verge of another substantial increase. Insights From Network Activity A telling metric, the adjusted price to Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence, provided intriguing insights into the Chainlink network&#8217;s current state. As the token&#8217;s price rose, the number of active addresses decreased. When looking at historical trends, this pattern has indicated previous upswings for the Chainlink network. Consequently, this data hints at the possibility of another impending price upswing for the LINK token. Bitcoin (BTC) trading at $29,855 today. Chart: TradingView.com The number of developers actively contributing to the Chainlink network has also experienced a significant increase since the first week of July. Technical analysts closely scrutinize chart patterns and price movements to identify potential trends and reversals. The recent rally in LINK&#8217;s price may have triggered breakout signals and attracted momentum traders, causing the price to surge even further. These technical indicators and chart patterns can act as self-fulfilling prophecies as traders react to them, potentially leading to a cascading effect on the token&#8217;s price. As the market evolves, tracking these key metrics, understanding market sentiment, and assessing broader market dynamics will be crucial in making informed decisions about LINK&#8217;s prospects.
