A target date of October 2023 was then set for the repayment of users’ assets. The registration process has been extended periodically for several years. Despite previous reassurances, Mt.

Gox was the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world when it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after discovering that 850,000 of its customers Bitcoin (BTC) had been stolen after years of subtle siphoning. The exchange has since recovered around 200,000 BTC.

At the time of the hack, the price of Bitcoin was around $580 apiece, meaning that many creditors would have realized gains on investment despite over half of their BTC being stolen.</p><p>In its communication to creditors, the trustee stated that payments could come as soon as the end of this year for registered creditors. However, like for the past decade, a caveat clause was included (as always): </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Please note that the schedule is subject to change depending on the circumstances, and the specific timing of repayments to each rehabilitation creditor has not yet been determined.”</p></blockquote><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-singaporean-fintech-raises-10m\">Singaporean fintech raises $10M </h2><p>Singaporean firm DCS Fintech Holdings has received a $10 million investment from Foresight Ventures for creating crypto-fiat on-ramping solutions. </p><p>According to the Sept. 21 announcement, DCS, which originally stood for “Diners Club Singapore,” the first credit card issuer in the city-state nation, will use the capital to develop “new payment solutions that provide a seamless connection between Web2 and Web3.” Its subsidiary, DCS Card Center, is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for issuing credit cards. CEO Karen Low commented:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The rapid evolution of Web3 today necessitates the bridging of payments into Web2, while the rise of fintechs is democratizing payments for consumers, creating demand for greater variety and refreshing experiences.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whale-8-1-million-of-eth-binance-buys-nfts/",
    "description": "Ethereum is under pressure and has just dropped below $1,600. However, on-chain data shows that a crypto whale, &#8220;0xb154&#8221;, has moved more coins from Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, to a non-custodial wallet. On September 21, the ETH whale transferred over $8.1 million of the coin.  Whale Moves More Ethereum From Binance, Buying NFTs When crypto prices contract, outflows from non-custodial wallets to centralized ramps, including Binance and Coinbase, tend to rise. This is because centralized exchanges supporting stablecoins or fiat, including the Euro or JPY, offer an interface where they can easily swap for the &#8220;safety&#8221; of the less volatile fiat currencies or tokens designed to mirror them, including USDT. Related Reading: Binance &#38; Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? That the holder is shifting tokens away from Binance regardless of the heightened volatility can signal confidence for ETH and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. It is not immediately clear what could have motivated the whale to move coins away from the exchange at this point. However, what&#8217;s evident is that ETH is down roughly 4% from September 21&#8217;s peak and moving further away from April 2023 highs when it rose to over $2,100. Records show this is not the first time the whale moved funds. On September 6, the investor withdrew 9,688 ETH worth $15.8 million from Binance. Less than two weeks earlier, the whale notably transferred 22,340 ETH, worth $41.2 million, to Binance. Related Reading: What The SEC’s Latest Announcement Means For The Crypto Industry A closer examination of the same address shows it has 24,556.59 ETH worth over $38.8 million at spot rates. Besides ETH, the address controls dust amounts of other periphery altcoins, including ZUM and SWISE. Apart from simply HODLing ETH, the whale has also been active on the non-fungible token (NFT) scene, looking at historical purchases. Over time, the investor has held over 100 NFTs where, on average, spent 0.2641 ETH; the latest purchase was on September 21. The investor has been actively accumulating NFTs since early April 2023 and has spent over 35 ETH. ETH And NFTs Are Fragile The whale has accumulated more ETH and NFTs when the crypto market is fragile. To illustrate, NFT trading volume is over 90% down from 2021 peaks.  Presently, ETH prices are down 25% from April 2023 peaks. When writing, bears have successfully forced the coin below June 2023 lows as the coin moves further away from the psychological $2,000 level. Candlestick arrangement points to weakness, suggesting that ETH could dump even lower to $1,400—or March 2023 lows, if sellers press on. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/this-binance-wallet-triggered-a-temporary-30x-surge-in-ethereum-gas-fees/",
    "description": "A cryptocurrency wallet associated with the prominent trading platform, Binance, has seen massive activity in the last 24 hours, leading to abnormally high transaction fees on the Ethereum network. Binance Wallet Incurs Nearly $850,000 Gas Fees In One Day A crypto wallet labeled “Binance 14” witnessed a significant transaction surge on September 21, rising above 140,000. As a result of this activity surge, transactions of the Binance-owned wallet consistently incurred gas fees of over 300 gwei, even though the network’s average fee was around 10 gwei. This gas fee jump and significant wallet activity have resulted in around 530 ETH (equivalent to nearly $850,000) in gas used on the Binance 14 address today.  Related Reading: Binance &#38; Deribit Traders Aggressively Short Bitcoin, Squeeze Incoming? The increase in transactions on the Binance wallet had a broader, albeit temporary, impact on the Ethereum network. Gas fees on the blockchain momentarily jumped from less than 10 gwei to above 330 gwei per transaction, according to blockchain data tracker Etherscan. Gas fees refer to the cost blockchain users incur or pay validators to conduct transactions or execute contracts on the Ethereum network. Fees depend on the blockchain&#8217;s demand and supply of processing power. This means when a network has many transactions, there is often a high demand for processing power, which increases gas fees. Possible Reasons For The Gas Fee Spike In the wake of this incident, Wu Blockchain reported that Binance said it was carrying out its wallet aggregation process when the gas fees were low to facilitate withdrawals and ensure the safety of user funds. Nonetheless, some prominent crypto community members have weighed in on the situation, offering possible explanations for the gas fee spike.  Martin Koppelmann, cofounder of the Gnosis chain, said on the X (formerly Twitter) platform that Binance might be using a “really inefficient script” to consolidate, leading to high transaction costs. Blockchain analysts at Scopescan gave a similar prognosis on the gas incident. The on-chain analytics platform said: Due to Binance consolidating funds from long-inactive deposit addresses, the Ethereum network is experiencing congestion, causing Gas fees to surge to 300 gwei. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price Adam Cochran, a popular crypto investor, suggested that the abnormally high transaction fees might have been due to Binance’s subpar APIs. In his X post, Cochran criticized the exchange’s technological infrastructure while casting doubts on its capacity to safe-keep “hundreds of billions in coins across multiple protocols.” According to CoinGecko data, the price of Ethereum currently sits below $1,600, reflecting a 2.8% decline in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, Ether maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $190 billion.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-investment-2023/",
    "description": "Over the years, Cardano (ADA) has grown to be one of the most beloved cryptocurrencies, securing its spot as one of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap in the process. However, while the Cardano network has grown tremendously, investors in its native ADA token have not been as lucky with profitability levels plummeting over the last two years. How Many ADA Holders Are Seeing Profits? Data from the on-chain tracking website IntoTheBlock shows that ADA might be the worst performer of the top 10 in terms of profitability. While the other assets in the top 10 have managed to maintain a reasonable profitability level for holders during the bear market, ADA has been in free fall. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery As a result of this, the tracker shows that the percentage of ADA investors seeing any kind of profit at this time has fallen to 0%. An alarming 95% of holders are reported to be seeing losses while 4% are sitting in neutral territory, meaning the prices at which these tokens were last moved correlate with the current price of the altcoin. Trackers shows 0% of ADA holders are in profit &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock To put this in perspective, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is sitting at 64% of holders in profit. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is at 52% of holders in profit. Dogecoin, which is one spot ahead of Cardano on the list, is at 41% of holders sitting in profit. Mid to long-term traders also completely dominate the ADA holder base. According to IntoTheBlock, 39% of all holders have held their coins between 1-12 months, while 61% of all holders have held for more than one year. Cardano Not Giving Up The Fight Despite the low profitability of the coin, investors seem to be looking toward ADA’s current price level as a good entry. This is evident in the CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report that showed that despite massive outflows from digital asset products, Cardano held strong. The altcoin was able to maintain its inflow trend with another $0.43 million flowing from institutional investors into the asset. Related Reading: This New Development Could Stop The Optimism (OP) Price Dead In Its Tracks Crypto analysts are also very bullish on the coin’s potential. One analyst, Kara Szabo, predicted that the price of ADA would rise as high as $5 in the next bull market, saying that the altcoin is in a prime price range for accumulation. Another analyst Hashtoshi, also said in an interview that he expects the altcoin to exceed its previous all-time high price marked in 2021. Hashtoshi attributes this expected rise to the network’s design and strong community backing the token.
