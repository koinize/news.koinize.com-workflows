Theres only one problem  at the moment, GPT-4 sucks at it.</p><p>Coinbase tried out ChatGPTs capabilities for automated token security reviews earlier this year, and in 25% of cases, it wrongly classified high-risk tokens as low-risk.<br>James Edwards, the lead maintainer for cybersecurity investigator Librehash, believes OpenAI isnt keen on having the bot used for tasks like this.</p><p>I strongly believe that OpenAI has quietly nerfed some of the bot’s capabilities when it comes to smart contracts for the sake of not having folks rely on their bot explicitly to draw up a deployable smart contract, he says, explaining that OpenAI likely doesnt want to be held responsible for any vulnerabilities or exploits.</p><p>This isnt to say AI has zero capabilities when it comes to smart contracts. AI Eye spoke with Melbourne digital artist Rhett Mankind back in May. He knew nothing at all about creating smart contracts, but through trial and error and numerous rewrites, was able to get <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/make-500-from-chatgpt-stock-tips-bard-leans-left-100m-ai-memecoin-ai-eye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >ChatGPT to create a memecoin called Turbo</a> that went on to hit a $100 million market cap.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">gm  <br><br>As someone with zero Solidity proficiency, I had an already efficient smart contract tailored to my own needs by AI.<br><br>I dumped <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Azuki?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >@Azuki</a>&#39;s smart contract into GPT-4 and had it ask me relevant questions. <br><br>Disclaimer: Professional human audits and devs are still important to <a href=\"https://t.co/K4UGfFC5dp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/K4UGfFC5dp</a></p>— SV (@0xSMV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xSMV/status/1636290229412970498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >March 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p>But as CertiK Chief Security Officer Kang Li points out, while you might get something working with ChatGPTs help, its likely to be full of logical code bugs and potential exploits:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You write something and ChatGPT helps you build it but because of all these design flaws it may fail miserably when attackers start coming. </p></blockquote><p>So its definitely not good enough for solo smart contract auditing, in which a tiny mistake can see a project drained of tens of millions  though Li says it can be a helpful tool for people doing code analysis.<br><br>Richard Ma from blockchain security firm Quantstamp explains that a major issue at present with its ability to audit smart contracts is that GPT -4s training data is far too general.<br><br><strong><em>Also read:</em> <em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/use-case-ai-crypto-money-payments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Real AI use cases in crypto, No. 1  The best money for AI is crypto</a></em></strong></p><p>“Because ChatGPT is trained on a lot of servers and theres very little data about smart contracts, it’s better at hacking servers than smart contracts,” he explains.</p><p>So the race is on to train up models with years of data of smart contract exploits and hacks so it can learn to spot them. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/risky-business-celsius-crisis-hated-accredited-investor-laws/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Risky business: Celsius crisis and the hated accredited investor laws</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/moon-man-mission-to-blast-crypto-satellite-into-orbit/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Space invaders: Launching crypto into orbit</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>“There are newer models where you can put in your own data, and that’s partly what we’ve been doing, he says. </p><p>“We have a really big internal database of all the different types of exploits.

It also uses Microsofts CodeBert pretrained programming languages model to help spot problems.</p><p>According to Edwards, in testing so far, the AI has been able to “audit contracts with an unprecedented amount of accuracy that far surpasses what one could expect and would receive from GPT-4.</p><p>The bulk of the work has been in creating a custom data set of smart contract exploits that identify the vulnerability down to the lines of code responsible. The next big trick is training the model to spot patterns and similarities. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Ideally you want the model to be able to piece together connections between functions, variables, context etc, that maybe a human being might not draw when looking across the same data.”</p></blockquote><p>While he concedes its not as good as a human auditor just yet, it can already do a strong first pass to speed up the auditors work and make it more comprehensive.<br><br>“Sort of help in the way LexisNexis helps a lawyer.
