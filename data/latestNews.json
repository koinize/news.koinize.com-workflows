The fund has already made five investment rounds, with two of these investments going toward Hong Kong-based startups.</p><p>The two Hong Kong startups include Mocaverse, an NFT project launched in December 2022 by Hong Kong blockchain firm Animoca Brands that raised US$20 million in September. Before that, in August, the Titan fund participated in the pre-seed funding round for Terminal 3, a Hong Kong-based Web3 data infrastructure start-up.</p><p>The $100 million crypto venture fund comes amid the drought of crypto funding related to the bear market and FTX collapse. According to data from Pitchbook, the value of global venture capital investments in crypto firms declined by 70.9% year-on-year, while the number of deals fell by 55%. This is in stark contrast to the bull market when crypto-based startups raised millions and the crypto ecosystem saw a new unicorn every other month.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-ceo-dont-start-crypto-company-in-us\"><strong><em>US ‘the only country’ crypto startups should avoid, says Ripple CEO</em></strong></a></p><p>The crypto VC fund launch in Hong Kong also signifies the city’s growing prominence as a safe crypto harbor.
