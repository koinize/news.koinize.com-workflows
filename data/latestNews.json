It takes CDD data and factors in the current BTC price, and its multiple then compares the 30-day result with the 365-day average.</p><p>“It is able to highlight when older coins begin to rapidly enter the market to be sold,” Swift explains in an instructional guide on LookIntoBitcoin. </p><blockquote>“This typically happens when longer-term participants look to take profits as price accelerates up in major bull market cycles.”</blockquote><p>The VDD Multiple currently measures 1.32, narrowly behind its 2023 peak of 1.37 seen in April. For Swift, this is a telltale sign of a “1st stage bull market.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/a9a1df88-1693-43e3-ab32-90f51176b44e.jpeg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin VDD Multiple annotated chart.
