In episode 43, Kena Amoah, CEO of MITA — a project building applications that combine metaverse, gaming and Web3 technology in Africa — explains how GameFi has evolved in the last few years and why it may lead the next wave of Web3 adoption. Amoah walks through the most significant GameFi developments of 2023 and highlights what trends he thinks will continue throughout 2024, as well as the problems that need to be fixed in the sector. </p><p>Amoah explains that the GameFi space is gaining traction because of the financial gains that may come with gaming and the decentralized nature of the entire space. With GameFi, developers are looking to build an experience that allows gamers to carry their credentials from one game to another. </p><p data-ct-non-breakable=\"true\">On why Web3 gaming is not taking off as expected in developing markets, Amoah explains that the user experience needs to improve to make it as easy as Web2 games. He highlights how new Web3 gamers may find simple things like wallet addresses confusing. He explains that onboarding needs to improve, and the selling point must go beyond being a blockchain game to giving gamers a fun experience. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hashing-it-out-crypto-narratives-gamefi-web3\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
