He had a limited scope while at OpenSea — where he worked in a non-management position. We have no awareness of his involvement with the projects in question.”</blockquote><p>“Furthermore, we have no connection to, or information about, the projects in question, as they took place before his time at OpenSea,\" said the company representative. </p><p>In October 2021, AnubisDAO raised 13,556 ETH — worth $60 million at the time — from crypto investors.
