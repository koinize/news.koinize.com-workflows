    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sei-token-rocks-altcoin-market-with-50-surge-whats-driving-the-momentum/",
    "description": "Turning the tide in the altcoin race, Sei Network&#8217;s SEI token has experienced an extraordinary 50% surge in the last 24 hours, outperforming the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This surge has pushed the token&#8217;s current trading price to $0.3638.  Attracting Global Attention?  According to CoinGecko data, Sei Network&#8217;s blockchain, explicitly built for trading, has optimized every layer of its stack to provide infrastructure for trading apps of all types.  Sei claims to outperform other Layer 1 blockchain, such as Solana and Aptos, by offering a native order-matching engine in Layer 1. This engine enables exchange apps built on top to scale more efficiently than ever. One of the standout features of the protocol is its speed, with a lower bound time to the finality of 300ms, making it the fastest chain in existence. This speed is achieved by implementing the Twin Turbo consensus, consisting of intelligent block propagation and optimistic block processing. According to CoinGecko, these innovations reduce the time required to achieve consensus securely and reliably. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? Moreover, Sei&#8217;s market-based parallelization sets it apart by offering a specialized kind of parallelization that differs from other leading blockchains. Additionally, Sei implements order batching to prevent frontrunning, enhancing the fairness and efficiency of its trading ecosystem. On the other hand, the Sei blockchain, launched on August 16, has amassed a market cap exceeding $380 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $1 billion. Notably, the blockchain has witnessed a surge in new user registrations, with over 40,000 new users joining in the past two days.  This influx of new users has further propelled the token&#8217;s market cap and trading volume, underscoring the growing interest in the Sei blockchain. Sei v2 Proposes Seamless EVM Integration Sei Labs co-founder Jayendra Jog recently unveiled the first “parallelized” Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), combining the aspects of Solana and Ethereum. According to Jayendra, this “hyper-optimized” execution layer leverages the tooling and mindshare surrounding the EVM, addressing a major pain point for developers.  As announced, Sei v2 introduces EVM support by integrating go-ethereum and enabling seamless deployment of contracts from other EVM chains. This compatibility allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum-based tooling and resources without additional effort.  Furthermore, optimistic parallelization eliminates the need for developers to define dependencies explicitly, enabling the chain to handle parallelization autonomously. This enhancement reduces developer friction and guarantees maximum parallelization of transactions whenever possible.  Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? Sei Labs’ co-founder stated that Sei v2 boasts orders of magnitude greater throughput with Sei&#8217;s speed than Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions.  The protocol&#8217;s upper bound of 12.5k transactions per second (TPS) is supported by early load tests, which have already observed over 5k TPS. Sei v2 will launch on a public testnet in the first quarter 2024. As Sei Network continues to garner attention from developers and traders alike, the future looks promising for this open-source Layer 1 blockchain.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-and-xlm-in-lockstep-expert-sheds-light-synchronization/",
    "description": "Recently, a notable observation has been the significant correlation between XRP and XLM&#8217;s price action. This phenomenon has caught the attention of industry experts and investors alike, leading to a deeper examination of the factors driving this trend. Ripple&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has weighed in on this topic, addressing the liquidity aspects of XRP and XLM. However, despite the visible correlation, Schwartz argues that more liquidity is needed in the XRP/XLM market to cause a notable price correlation. Related Reading: Stunning Correlation Emerges Between XRP And XLM, What’s Going On? This statement is based on data from CoinmarketCap, which illustrates the parallel price movements of these two cryptocurrencies over the past year. Schwartz&#8217;s insights provoke a deeper analysis of the potential reasons behind the alignment in their price behaviors. Coinmarketcap makes it easy to compare the charts of various tokens. Here&#8217;s XRP versus XLM over the past year: pic.twitter.com/qNzfIu2TTB — David &#8220;JoelKatz&#8221; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 18, 2023 Unraveling The Factors Behind XRP And XLM&#8217;s Correlated Price Movements David Schwartz has identified three key factors influencing the XRP-XLM price correlation. Firstly, he posits that the entire digital asset market is significantly interconnected. The market is still determining cryptocurrencies&#8217; long-term viability, so industry news tends to affect all tokens, not just specific ones. This broader market sentiment could drive the correlation observed in XRP and XLM. Secondly, Schwartz suggests that the dominance of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market could play a role. Given Bitcoin&#8217;s substantial market share and its influence on liquidity within the crypto space, movements in Bitcoin&#8217;s price often result in ripple effects across other crypto, including XRP and XLM. I think there are a variety of factors that might be at play and it&#8217;s hard to know which are real. One thing is that all digital assets track each other significantly. I think that&#8217;s because the market is still trying to figure out if they&#8217;re going to be a thing and so industry… — David &#8220;JoelKatz&#8221; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 18, 2023 The third factor revolves around the crypto community&#8217;s perception that XRP and XLM require similar market conditions to thrive. However, Schwartz noted that he is &#8220;not sure if he believes this.&#8221; Developments within the broader crypto industry could prompt parallel reactions from users of both tokens, leading to correlated price patterns. Diverse Perspectives: From Short-Term Volatility To Long-Term Convictions On the other hand, Bill Morgan, a lawyer and digital asset enthusiast, brings a different viewpoint, mainly focusing on XRPL token. Addressing recent market volatility, Morgan emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective when analyzing XRP&#8217;s price action. Responding to crypto community concerns about XRP&#8217;s performance, especially during heightened market movements, Morgan argues that convictions about the token should go &#8220;beyond short-term price fluctuations.&#8221; Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When Morgan&#8217;s stance is echoed by Matt, the Moon Lambo YouTube channel host, who points out that XRP&#8217;s price drop was not as severe as some in the crypto community perceived. Matt&#8217;s analysis places XRP at a moderate position among the top 50 coins by market cap in terms of gains and losses. This is correct but placed in the context of XRP’s price action over the last month it is not great. XRP is down over 2% over the last month. Many but not all top 50 coins are up over the last month. In that context the fall was harder comparatively than could have been expected… https://t.co/VrlD2k0mWu — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) December 19, 2023 However, Morgan notes that the token&#8217;s performance over the past month has been lackluster, falling by over 2% despite a market-wide rally. This observation suggests that XRP&#8217;s decline was more pronounced than that of some of its peers, warranting a closer examination of its market dynamics.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-growing-organically-like-bitcoinada-boom/",
    "description": "Taking to X on December 18, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, celebrated the network&#8217;s recent growth, noting that it&#8217;s mirroring the organic development of Bitcoin (BTC). While some have expressed concerns about network congestion, Hoskinson affirmed that Cardano is designed to handle such loads and has ample room for future scalability. Demand Increasing, Cardano Moving Away From &#8220;Ghost Chain&#8221; Status In a post garnering significant attention on X, the founder said he has been watching with &#8221; glee as some people worry about Cardano&#8217;s blocks filling up.&#8221; The founder reminded the community that it was only a few months earlier that the network had been slammed for being a &#8220;ghost chain&#8221; with no utility.  However, as the network &#8220;gets busy&#8221; and blocks fill up, Hoskinson assured the community that the platform is designed to handle rising demand with more room to grow in the future. While Cardano aims to compete with Ethereum as a smart contract platform of choice, its development is anchored on peer research, and progress has been systematic. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP 1,500% Move Against Bitcoin, What Are The Terms? Looking at block explorer data from Cexplorer, the average block saturation of Cardano stands at 56.98% as of December 18. This figure is higher than the monthly average of 44.5%. However, what&#8217;s clear is that block size has been gradually rising over the past two years. As of early 2021, the average block usage, measuring capacity, was 64kb.  This figure now stands at 88kb, signaling growth and more adoption from app developers. However, it should be noted that the maximum capacity in Cardano is an adjustable parameter. Accordingly, it can be changed in light of transactional demand. Cardano Refinements: Will ADA Prices Boom Like Bitcoin? Cardano is in the Basho stage after graduating from Goguen when the network activated smart contracts. With more dapps launching, the platform is optimizing to enhance performance and boost scalability. Scalability is a big concern in blockchains since it can directly determine how fast transactions are processed, a factor that also plays a big role in determining fees. Even so, unlike Ethereum, fees are stable in Cardano, regardless of network load. Related Reading: Santiment Breaks Down “Most Trending” Altcoins Of Past Week Hoskinson also highlighted Cardano&#8217;s organic growth in the post on X, attributing its success to the community&#8217;s involvement and engagement. The founder emphasized that venture capitalists, the crypto media, or influencers are not driving the platform, just like how Bitcoin grows.  This comparison could aim salvo at other smart contract competitors, including Solana. The FTX estate controlled a significant portion of SOL&#8217;s circulating supply. The defunct exchange will gradually sell SOL to repay creditors. Even so, whether ADA will follow the same trajectory as BTC in the long run remains to be seen. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/95-bitcoin-spot-etf-january/",
    "description": "The anticipation around a potential approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF is still high among crypto investors. This anticipation has been one of the main drivers of the price rally that has been witnessed over the last two months. Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponing its decision on multiple spot ETF filings, industry experts remain very positive that the regulator is on the verge of approving the first Spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin Spot ETF Coming In January 2024 Many experts have revised their expectations for if and when the SEC would approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF. At first, expectations were low. But as time has gone on, the expectations have risen quickly and analysts at Matrixport are part of the camp that believes a Spot Bitcoin ETF is on its way. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $22, Here’s When In a report released on Monday, December 18, Matrixport Head of Research Markus Thielen reveals a 95% chance that a Spot BTC ETF will be approved in January 2024. January carries the deadline dates for most of the 13 filings so far, and Thielen expects that the SEC will approve a spot ETF on January 10. The report points to the fact that BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, reviewed its S-1 filing with the SEC. Here, the regulator had given the asset manager instructions which included monitoring unusual price movements, storing all private keys in cold storage, and having procedures in the event there are Bitcoin forks. Additionally, the SEC also responded to Franklin-Templeton’s filing in November despite having until January to do so. This move, the analyst says, “gave the impression that the SEC is lining all issuers up to get approval by January 10, 2024.” Thielen explains the importance of the meeting the regulator had with BlackRock, saying,  “The SEC has never actively engaged with potential ETF issues and appears to have given all ETF issuers with whom it had discussions the same instructions.” BTC price shows high level of volatility &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Expectations After Approvals Given that Matrixport expects approvals to come in January, the analyst also gave their expectation for price when this happens. Thielen expects that Bitcoin will go on another rally once this happens and the price could rise as high as $50,000 in the first quarter of the year 2024 as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode, Can DOGE Price Reach $0.2? “We expect this correction to switch back into another leg higher in Bitcoin prices after Christmas as investors take advantage of the recent correction and position themselves for the likely Bitcoin Spot ETF approval period &#8211; January 8 to January 10, 2024,” the analyst said, alluding to the decline in price that Bitcoin has recorded over the last week. As for Grayscale, the analyst doesn’t believe that the SEC would allow for a conversion of the Bitcoin trust into a Spot ETF on January 10. However, they do expect 20% of precious metal demand to switch to Spot Bitcoin ETFs following the approvals. Featured image from Atlantic Council, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has recently shared his latest Bitcoin price prediction on X. Van de Poppe has now set his sights on new heights for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent post, the analyst expressed confidence that Bitcoin has concluded its corrective phase and is primed to test the $47,000-$50,000 range soon. Van de Poppe&#8217;s optimism stems from a critical market development: the potential approval of spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) by major financial entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment. This anticipated move, widely supported by industry experts, could catalyze BTC&#8217;s leap.

Ali, another market analyst, has raised concerns over Bitcoin&#8217;s recent slip below a crucial supply zone, ranging from $41,200 to $42,400. Leveraging on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, Ali pointed out that this zone is a stronghold for 1.87 million addresses, cumulatively holding around 730,000 BTC. He warns that a breach below this level could trigger a sell-off, potentially pushing Bitcoin down to the next demand zone between $37,500 and $38,700. #Bitcoin has slipped below a key supply zone, ranging from $41,200 to $42,400. In this area, 1.87 million addresses had accumulated 730,000 $BTC. This downturn might trigger these holders to sell, aiming to cut losses. If selling pressure increases, watch for a possible decline… pic.twitter.com/aTX1RWarkb — Ali (@ali_charts) December 18, 2023 However, in a positive twist, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, surpassing the $42,400 mark. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has witnessed a near 3% rise, trading around $42,548 at the time of writing. This resurgence is a strong indicator that Bitcoin has re-entered and solidified its position in the critical supply zone identified by Ali. Bitcoin Path To $200,000 By 2024 Beyond these immediate forecasts, Dan Tapiero, Managing Partner at 10T Holdings, envisions a broader transformation for Bitcoin and the crypto market. Tapiero, echoing insights from Real Vision&#8217;s CEO Raoul Paul, predicts that BTC could surge to over $200,000 by May 2024. This bullish trajectory is not just mere speculation. Still, it is backed by the anticipation of a significant liquidity influx into the BTC market, especially with the potential SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Introducing these spot ETFs, especially from traditional finance stalwarts like BlackRock, is poised to be a game-changer. It offers institutional investors a regulated avenue to dive into BTC, thereby enhancing the coin&#8217;s liquidity and, consequently, its market value.

The whales refer to the largest investors in the sector, who can hold some influence due to the size of their holdings.

How a whale moves could affect the market depends on what the whale intends to achieve with it. Generally, it&#8217;s hard to say with certainty about such a motive, but depending on the types of wallets involved and the direction of the coins&#8217; flow, some hints can be gathered. The two oldest transfers from the past day involved the movement of $5.1 million and $7.5 million worth of Dogecoin to the Robinhood platform. Below are the details for the older of the two transactions. Looks like the transaction needed a fee of just $0.41 to go through &#124; Source: Whale Alert As is visible, an unknown wallet was the sender of the transaction. Such wallets are unattached to any known centralized platform and will likely be investors&#8217; self-custodial addresses. When an investor shifts their coins from their wallets to exchanges, there is always a possibility the move has been made for selling purposes. As such, this deposit from the whale could be bearish for DOGE. The same would go for the other Robinhood deposit from the past day. Besides these two deposits, there has been one more exchange inflow transaction in this same window to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The Coinbase DOGE deposit from today &#124; Source: Whale Alert This $5.9 million deposit comes after Dogecoin recovered from its recent lows, so the whale may be looking to sell while some gains remain. The final transaction from the last 24 hours is the largest of the four, as it has seen DOGE worth a whopping $41.5 million shift across the network. However, this transfer is unremarkable because only unknown addresses have been involved in it.

Thus, unlike the other exchange deposits, this transfer could end up causing volatility in any direction, or it may not even have any influence. DOGE Price Dogecoin had recently plunged towards the $0.087 level but has since recovered above the $0.091 mark. The price of the memecoin appears to have run out of bullish momentum recently &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"
