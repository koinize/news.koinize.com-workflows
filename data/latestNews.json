It's not trying to be token specific.” </blockquote><p>Power said “it’s fair to assume” crypto-specific legislation will appear sometime in 2024 — but that it ultimately depends on how it is received by Australia’s lawmakers.</p><p>Crypto assets that change their function and utility over time will likely be subject to review, according to Power.</p><blockquote>“If they become very significant [...] Then they will graduate through the regulatory system.” </blockquote><p>He stressed the token mapping regulation will need to be “robust” in order to operate in a “tech-neutral” and “principles-based manner” to account for such changes.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/ae991817-4079-41ce-8657-7cbb1febeb5e.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Australian Treasury’s Trevor Power speaking at Australian Blockchain Week 2023.
