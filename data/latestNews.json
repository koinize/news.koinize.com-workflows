That includes a rebound across the market's top-ranking assets, with Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) gaining a modest 1.8% and 1.75%. Meanwhile, Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) was one of the best performers jumping 8.5%.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b49a2749-a5a7-4318-a105-9e7ce778dd1a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto total market cap daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The crypto market's intraday recovery coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">release of the U.S. Labor Department report</a>. The labor market added 209,000 jobs in June compared to 306,000 in the previous month, prompting hopes that the Federal Reserve may ignore raising interest rates in its July meeting. </p><p>\"Hawks could push for a September hike,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickTimiraos/status/1677320786833440768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noted</a> Nick Timiraos, chief economic correspondent at the Wall Street Journal, adding: </p><blockquote>\"Doves will want to at least skip and give more time to see if the data decay by Halloween. But the June jobs report will be old news by September. It neither shows a sudden stop or a big re-acceleration in hiring.\"</blockquote><p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-does-the-u-s-dollar-index-dxy-impact-cryptocurrencies-watch-macro-markets\">U.S. dollar index</a> (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, weakened after the jobs report headline, dropping to a two-week low.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/f145799f-242b-4099-98b2-c6f5823d8264.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DXY vs. crypto market cap trend comparison on hourly chart.

Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>As shown in the image above, the 50-day EMA has limited the crypto market's downside bias since late June 2023. For instance, the wave's last retest on June 29 preceded a 7.5% rebound in the crypto market's valuation. </p><h2>What's ahead for the crypto market?</h2><p>Despite weaker monthly jobs data, the market <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sees</a> a 95% probability of the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points (bps) in July. That risks limiting the crypto market's upside prospects in the month with one technical pattern potentially hinting at downside ahead.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today\">Here’s what happened in crypto today</a></em></strong></p><p>Notably, the crypto market has formed what appears to be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bearish-head-and-shoulders-pattern-forces-ethereum-traders-to-re-adjust-their-price-targets\">head-and-shoulders (H&amp;S)</a>, a bearish reversal pattern. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/0bcd52bc-8b07-4702-ac36-129c0fe5dab2.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto total market cap weekly chart.
