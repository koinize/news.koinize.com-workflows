The faster we can stop fraud, the more we can protect customers from harm.”</blockquote><p>Romero acknowledged the efforts of CFTC’s Office of Customer Education and Outreach which teaches people to spot, avoid and report cryptocurrency fraud.</p><p>“With the rise of crypto, more retail customers have come under the CFTC’s jurisdiction,” Romero said.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-issues-54m-default-judgment-against-trader-in-crypto-fraud-scheme\"><strong><em>CFTC issues $54M default judgment against trader in crypto fraud scheme </em></strong></a></p><p>The CFTC has doled out almost $350 million since the program started in 2014.
