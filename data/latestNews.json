    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/lunc/ustc-lunc-to-1/",
    "description": "The LUNC community has received a proposal from Genuine Labs, a group of experienced developers who aim to contribute to the Terra Classic ecosystem, something that could help revive the USTC and LUNC tokens.  What The Latest LUNC Proposal Is About According to the proposal titled ‘Genuine Labs Terra Classic Development Proposal,’ the developers who boast extensive experience in Cosmos stacks aim to work with L1 teams to improve the IBC Hooks and Packet Forward Middleware (PFM) features. They will also enhance the “end-to-end testing and interchain testing for the fee tax charging mechanism.” Related Reading: Google AI Predicts When XRP Price Will Cross $5 And What Will Drive It These plans, if implemented, apparently come with a lot of benefits for the Terra Classic ecosystem. For one, the IBC Hooks is said to be capable of enhancing liquidity and cross-chain DeFi applications. IBC-hook token transfers will also help facilitate direct dApp interaction. Meanwhile, the PFM will enable multi-hop transfers and robust interchain applications. Improving and integrating testing mechanisms also comes with its benefits. This will ensure that the tax mechanism is efficient and reliable and developers will be able to simulate real-world scenarios for thorough testing. Lastly, implementing this will also help accelerate development in the Terra Classic ecosystem.  If the proposal gets approved, Genuine Labs will carry out these plans in two phases. The developers also mentioned that implementation will last for for six weeks and will cost $16,000. So far, most validators seem to be in support of the proposal, as 57.32% of the total votes cast have voted in support of it.  The quorum is, however, yet to be met as just over 8% of those meant to vote have actually voted. Voting for the proposal will end on December 30. Therefore, there is still enough time for the proposal to scale through.  LUNC price at $0.00015 &#124; Source: LUNCUSDT on Tradingview.com Update On The Plan To Burn 800 Million USTC Bitcoinist had previously reported the LUNC community’s proposal to burn 800 million USTC from the Luna Classic treasury. Voting on the proposal had begun, and then, it looked more likely than not that the proposal was going to scale through. However, things have taken a drastic turn since then.  Related Reading: $10 Million Worth Of Dogecoin Exit Robinhood – What This Could Mean For Price Data from the voting forum shows that more validators have voted against the proposal since then. In fact, some of these validators have gone as far as voting against the proposal with their veto power. This is significant as the veto votes currently stand at 24.55% of the total votes cast so far, and the veto threshold is 33.40%.  Validators seem to be against this move due to the legal repercussions. This proposal was said to have legally absolved them, but they might still not think so and are choosing to be cautious. Voting ends on December 27, and it will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Featured image from Block Builders, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-dips-2220/",
    "description": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $2,350 resistance zone. ETH could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,200 support zone. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $2,350 resistance zone. The price is trading near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could attempt a fresh increase unless there is a close below $2,200. Ethereum Price Remains Supported Ethereum price failed again to gain pace for a move above the $2,350 level. ETH formed a short-term near $2,350 and recently started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. The price even spiked below $2,250. A low was formed near $2,247 and the price is now correcting higher. There was a move above the $2,265 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low. Ethereum is now near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,285 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low. A close above the $2,285 resistance could send the price toward $2,350. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a major increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,550 zone. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,285 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,220 level. The first key support could be the $2,200 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,200 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Level – $2,200 Major Resistance Level – $2,285"
