The new filing aligns with Grayscales ongoing effort to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a statement from the firm. The news comes weeks after Grayscale <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >won an SEC lawsuit for its spot Bitcoin ETF review</a>, with a court of appeals ordering the SEC to explain why it rejected Grayscales application in June 2023.

The suit claims that Gemini assured investors that the program was a low-risk investment, while investigations carried out by the office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James found that Genesis financials were risky. The lawsuit also charges Genesis’ former CEO, Soichiro Moro, and its parent companys CEO, Barry Silbert, with defrauding investors by attempting to conceal more than $1.1 billion in losses. In addition, the court case looks to ban Gemini, Genesis and DCG from operating in the financial investment industry in New York.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-former-ftx-engineering-director-faces-up-to-75-years-in-prison-following-guilty-plea\"><strong>Former FTX engineering director faces up to 75 years in prison following guilty plea</strong></h2><p>Nishad Singh, the former engineering director at now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-engineering-director-faces-prison-guilty-plea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >faces up to 75 years in prison</a> for charges related to defrauding users of the crypto exchange.

George Jarkesy argues that the SECs internal adjudication process, which lacks a jury and is overseen by an administrative law judge appointed by the commission, contradicts his Seventh Amendment rights. Effectively resulting in a single entity fulfilling the roles of judge, jury and enforcer.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_1-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24768\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_1-1024x682.png 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_1-300x200.png 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_1-770x513.png 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_1.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-winners-and-losers\"><strong>Winners and Losers</strong></h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"826\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WL-oct-21-01-1024x826.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24769\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WL-oct-21-01-1024x826.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WL-oct-21-01-300x242.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WL-oct-21-01-770x621.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WL-oct-21-01.jpg 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure><p>At the end of the week, Bitcoin <strong>(</strong><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>BTC</strong></a><strong>)</strong> is at <strong>$29,590</strong>, Ether <strong>(</strong><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>ETH</strong></a><strong>)</strong> at <strong>$1,607</strong> and <a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>XRP</strong></a> at <strong>$0.52</strong>.

Some might consider that a confirmation of a bull breakout, but this market is known for squeezes and fake outs so Im looking for more confirmations. For me BTC will also need to take out prior resistance at $30.5k, $31.5k and ultimately $33k to call a bull breakout confirmed and validated.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fud-of-the-week\"><strong>FUD of the Week </strong></h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_2-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24767\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_2-1024x682.png 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_2-300x200.png 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_2-770x513.png 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Digest_21-10_2.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-\"><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/california-files-order-against-nexo-interest-account-says-it-s-8th-state-to-take-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" ></a></h3><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fantom-foundation-hot-wallet-hacked-for-550k\"><strong>Fantom Foundation hot wallet hacked for $550K</strong></h2><p>The Fantom Foundation, the developer of the Fantom network, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fantom-foundation-hacked-october-17-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has been hacked for over $550,000</a> worth of cryptocurrency.
