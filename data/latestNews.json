    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/can-pepe-coin-floki-and-pomerdoge-hit-001-by-2023",
    "description": "<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>\nPepe (PEPE) Soar on Bullish Whale Activity \n<p class=\"s8\">Pepe (PEPE) is a cryptocurrency inspired by the internet meme Pepe the Frog. Surprisingly, Pepe experienced a phenomenal rally after its launch on April 16th, achieving a 7000% price pump within just 17 days.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">However, its price sharply dropped to $0.000001153 on May 12th, 2023, and has been on a decline since then. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe is bullish today trading at $0.00000143, an increase of 12% in the last 24 hours. This is coming after huge whale activity.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed that two whales bought over 1.56 trillion tokens. This is about 1,100 ETH ($2.06 million). Although Pepe's price has dropped, it still maintains a robust market cap of over $500 million. However, being a meme coin with no use case, Pepe would have a tough time reaching $0.01. Besides, Pepe will have to soar more than 600,000x to reach $0.01.</p>\nFloki Inu (FLOKI) Drops 8% on the Weekly Chart \n<p class=\"s8\">The Floki Inu (FLOKI) project initially started as a meme-coin based on Elon Musk's dog. However, it has since evolved into a fully-fledged web3 project, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The Floki token is now famously referred to as \"The People's Crypto.\" Meanwhile, Floki Inu is bearish on the weekly timeframe, trading at $0.00002243. This is an 8.01% price decline in the past 7 days.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Floki Inu is 93.46% away from its all-time high of $0.0003437. Similarly, Floki Inu's trading volume has been on a steep decline. It has dropped by about &nbsp;24.10% in the last 24 hours, a sign of low market activity and support from investors. Looking forward, Floki Inu has a bleak chance of hitting 0.01$ in 2023.</p>\nAnalysts: Pomerdoge (POMD) To Skyrocket 4,000%\n<p class=\"s8\">Unlike Pepe and Floki Inu, Pomerdoge has a great utility that would increase its price in 2023. Currently, the token's price stands at a mere $0.007. Despite this, analysts express a bullish outlook on the project, projecting an impressive 4,000% ROI for potential investors.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Pomerdoge aims to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain gaming market as a P2E cryptocurrency game. As per MarketsandMarkets, the global blockchain gaming market will hit $65.7 billion by 2027.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">Pomerdoge's vision is to foster global connections among players by offering an engaging and competitive gaming experience. The SolidProof and Cyberscope have already audited the project, ensuring user security. &nbsp;At the heart of the Pomerdoge ecosystem lies $POMD, the Pomerdoge token.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\">This in-game currency grants users access to a variety of benefits, including NFTs, rewards, and exclusive items from the Pomerdoge marketplace.</p>\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today\n<p class=\"s11\">Website: https://pomerdoge.com/</p>\n<p class=\"s11\">Telegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p class=\"s5\">The presale round of Tradecurve (TCRV) has taken the crypto world by storm with its eye-popping growth projection. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and TRON (TRX) have struggled to stop their investors from agitating. Tradecurve has become an instant hit after entering the market. It has raised around $180k during its presale so far.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>\nStellar (XLM) Settles With Mediocre Gains\n<p class=\"s5\">Stellar (XLM) has been one of the best performers in 2023. But the recent weeks have been mediocre for Stellar. The market value of Stellar (XLM) tokens has dropped by 12% in the past week. However, Stellar has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. However, the current trading price of Stellar is 90% down from its peak of $0.94.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Experts have cited Stellar&rsquo;s recent partnerships as the main reason behind the increase in the network&rsquo;s price. Stellar recently hit the headlines after Brazil&rsquo;s central bank selected it for the development of its digital currency,</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Digital Real. Besides, Stellar is now connected to Polkadot through the Pendulum parachain, which has added to the bullish momentum of XLM. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.0943.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>\nTRON&rsquo;s (TRX) Development Activity Plunges\n<p class=\"s5\">Analysts have been closely observing the price trajectory of TRX since the US SEC filed a lawsuit against TRON founder, Justin Sun. Notably, TRON (TRX) lost 6% of its market value in March. Hence, any event having ramifications on TRON is of significance for investors, who will then decide to stay with the network.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Besides a lawsuit against its founder, TRON has also suffered from a 36% plunge in the development activity on the network. These bearish events forced TRON to unveil its new staking mechanism called Stake 2.0.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">However, TRON has faced criticism after unveiling the new staking mechanism, as some of its community members have raised questions about the preparedness of the network for this update. A TRON token is currently available to purchase at $0.0653.</p>\nTradecurve (TCRV) Prepares a Solid Foundation For Mega Launch\n<p class=\"s5\">The overall crypto market is expanding its ecosystem rapidly. Its user penetration is expected to be 8.8% in 2023, and 12.5% by 2027, and the number of crypto traders can clock over 994 million in the next five years. Tapping this huge target market, Tradecurve (TCRV) is pegged to become one of the top three trading exchanges in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Existing trading platforms are either dealing with only cryptocurrencies, or exclusively facilitating the trade of conventional derivatives. But Tradecurve is a revolutionary platform thatallows the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, commodities, ETFs, bonds, and more, on from a single account. </p>\n<p class=\"s5\">It has also rolled out an educational academy, where investors can learn new techniques and strategies to polish their skills.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Its presale phase is currently advancing through stage 1, and the price of TCRV tokens is $0.018. It is forecasted to jump by 50x during the presale phase, and 100x after getting listed on Uniswapand multiple CEXs. So, if you are willing to convert your thousand dollars into millions, lock your TCRV now before the tokens get sold out. </p>\n<p class=\"s13\">To find more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token, visit the links below:</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Website: https://tradecurve.io/</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Buy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Twitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Telegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.
