    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is attempting a fresh increase from the $0.4720 zone. ADA could start a fresh rally if there is a close above the $0.5350 resistance. ADA price is moving higher above the $0.500 zone. The price is trading above $0.512 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.510 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could accelerate higher if there is a clear move above $0.535 and $0.550. Cardano Price Eyes Fresh Increase After forming a base above the $0.4720 level, Cardano started a fresh increase. ADA price was able to climb above the $0.485 and $0.500 resistance levels to move into a positive zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.510 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. The bulls pushed the pair above the $0.520 resistance zone. However, the bears are now active near the $0.535 resistance zone. ADA price is now trading above $0.512 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $0.4718 swing low to the $0.5354 high. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.535 zone. The first resistance is near $0.545 and $0.550. The next key resistance might be $0.565. If there is a close above the $0.565 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.600 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.620. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.535 resistance level, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.520 level. The next major support is near the $0.5040 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $0.4718 swing low to the $0.5354 high. A downside break below the $0.5040 level could open the doors for a test of $0.485. The next major support is near the $0.4720 level. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.520, $0.5040, and $0.4720. Major Resistance Levels – $0.5350, $0.550, and $0.600."
