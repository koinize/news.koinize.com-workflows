That's the kind of blight the Ordinals Protocol brought to Bitcoin.</p>\n                    <p><p>The inception of the Ordinals Protocol on the Bitcoin network has sparked extensive debate among enthusiasts and skeptics alike. At its core, the integration of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world\">nonfungible tokens (NFTs)</a> on Bitcoin — which the protocol facilitated — is unaligned with Bitcoin’s original design and ethos. It represents a disruptive and unwelcome diversion.</p><p>Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) was conceived as a decentralized digital currency, primarily focused on facilitating financial transactions. Its design and architecture were meticulously crafted to serve this purpose, ensuring security, efficiency, and accessibility. The introduction of NFTs via Ordinals represents a significant departure from this foundational objective. </p><p>Its implementation raised concerns among some developers and users, who describe it as exploiting a vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol. This perspective suggests that the integration of Ordinals was not a planned or natural evolution of Bitcoin's capabilities but rather a manipulation of its existing framework. Such a viewpoint casts doubt on the legitimacy and long-term viability of Ordinals within the Bitcoin ecosystem, which also risks diluting its original vision and confusing its user base about its primary function.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-put-digital-graffiti-bitcoin-blockchain\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

The new feature will allow these so-called “layer 3” networks to reduce data publishing costs by up to 90% when compared with using Ethereum for data availability and without relying on a permissioned solution, according to the announcement.</p><p>Madara networks publish <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained\">zero-knowledge validity proofs</a> to Starknet, which is itself a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions\">layer 2 of Ethereum</a>. For this reason, they are often referred to as “Layer 3s.” These networks use a common sequencer that is decentralized by default. The decentralized nature of the sequencer <a href=\"https://docs.madara.zone/architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">should</a> help to ensure that transactions cannot be censored, the team claims. Madara chains are customized for specific applications. Mangata Finance, Kakachain, Tobi and Alakazam are a few examples of these custom networks.</p><p>Avail is a network designed to handle data availability for the Ethereum ecosystem. If an Ethereum layer-2 uses Avail for data availability, it publishes validity proofs to Ethereum but leaves the compressed transaction data on Avail. This reduces the cost of transactions but also requires Avail to be operating at all times to facilitate deposits and withdrawals. A network that stores transaction data off chain in this way is called a “validum,” which is often contrasted with a full “rollup” that has higher transaction fees but publishes all data to Ethereum.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/avail-collaborates-starkware-reduce-costs-layer-3-madara-appchains\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
