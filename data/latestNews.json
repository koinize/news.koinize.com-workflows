Major AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard show the capabilities of generative AI to comprehend and produce human-like writing.</p><p>According to Visa’s chief product and strategy officer Jack Forestell, generative AI has a promising future in the financial world. He said:</p><blockquote>“While much of generative AI so far has been focused on tasks and content creation, this technology will soon not only reshape how we live and work, but it will also meaningfully change commerce in ways we need to understand.”</blockquote><p>Visa’s latest move into generative AI comes on the heels of significant efforts to apply AI technology in the company’s ecosystem.</p><p>Visa <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2023/09/13/30-years-of-1694624229357.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">says</a> it was one of the first firms in the world to pioneer AI use in payments back in 1993, deploying AI-based technology for risk and fraud management. In 2022, Visa’s real-time payment fraud monitoring solution, Visa Advanced Authorization, reportedly helped prevent an estimated $27 billion in fraud.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-yuan-app-adds-prepaid-mastercard-visa-payments-tourists\"><strong><em>Digital yuan app adds prepaid Mastercard, Visa top-ups for tourists</em></strong></a></p><p>In 2021, Visa also <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17701.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> VisaNet +AI, a suite of AI-based services focused on fixing delays and confusion with managing account balances and other issues of daily settlement for financial institutions.</p><p>Some of the tools in the VisaNet +AI suite include Smarter Stand-In Processing, which aims to improve payment experiences during outages by mirroring issuer approval decisions.
