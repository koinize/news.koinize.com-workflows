It's just the USD number. And, two, the number listed here does not match what was in the database.”</blockquote><p>An exhibit in the Oct. 6 trial shows the alleged code used to generate the size of the so-called \"Backstop Fund” or public insurance fund. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From yesterday&#39;s exhibits in US v.

This was supposedly in an attempt to hide the loss, as Alameda’s balance sheets were more private than those of FTX.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-slams-sam-bankman-fried-sympathizers\"><strong><em>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton slams Sam Bankman-Fried sympathizers</em></strong></a></p><p>In addition to revealing the allegedly fraudulent nature of FTX’s insurance fund, Wang claimed that he and Nishad Singh were prompted by Bankman-Fried to implement an “allow_negative” balance feature in the code at FTX, which allowed Alameda Research to trade with near-unlimited liquidity on the crypto exchange. </p><p>On Oct. 5 Wang — who has already pleaded guilty to all charges pressed against him <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-goes-on-trial-week-review\">— admitted to committing wire fraud, commodities fraud and securities fraud</a> with Bankman-Fried, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and former-FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
