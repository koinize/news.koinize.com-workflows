Meanwhile, the peg ratio for crypto-backed and commodity-backed stablecoins was far less at 77% and 50%, respectively.</p><p>\"Only seven fiat backed stablecoins have been able to keep their deviations from the peg below 1% for more than 97% of their life span,\" BIS wrote. Both Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>) and USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>) met this test standard. However, \"All other fiat-backed stablecoins temporarily lost their pegs more frequently and with much larger deviations,\" the financial institution continued.</p><p>BIS also warned that some stablecoin issuers do not solicit independent certified public accountants to examine their reserves, and for those who do, the reserve reports often do not follow a common reporting standard. \"Due to this lack of clarity, it is unclear whether these stablecoins would be able to convert users' stablecoins at par on demand, and what the financial stability implications would be of a potential run,\" the entity stated.</p><p>In March, Circle's USDC briefly depegged over 10% from its 1:1 exchange rate with the U.S. dollar after its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-slowly-repegs-on-unconfirmed-reports-of-svb-resolution\">reserve deposits became temporarily stuck</a> in the failed Silicon Valley Bank.

Bitcoin derivatives markets have seen a huge build-up of open interest, rising above $16 billion at the time of writing, per CoinGlass <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data</a>.

That has resulted in solid rallies in several altcoins, which have broken out of long basing patterns and are showing signs of starting a new uptrend. Altcoins may witness bouts of profit-booking but are likely to remain in focus as long as Bitcoin does not crumble below $30,000.</p><p>What are the critical support levels in Bitcoin that need to hold for the uptrend to continue? Will the altcoin rally sustIain, or is it time to book profits?</p><p>Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin continues to trade inside a narrow ascending channel pattern, indicating that buyers are cautious at the current levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/e247f37f-28f8-4554-b1b6-72cd630cb038.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($33,612) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers propel the price above the channel, it will suggest that the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. That could clear the path for a potential rally to $40,000. This level is likely to attract strong selling by the bears.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are booking profits. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $32,400 and eventually to $31,000.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) has been slowly moving higher toward the significant resistance at $2,000. This is an important level to watch out for as the bears stalled the up-move at $2,000 on two previous occasions in May and July.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/375d37e0-df47-48b7-b264-e6bd8d98d7cc.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the ETH/USDT pair does not give up much ground from $2,000, it will suggest that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. There is a minor resistance at $2,200, but if this level is scaled, the up-move may pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $3,500.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1,800), the next stop is likely to be $1,746. </p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) has been in a recovery phase for several days. The price reached $256 on Nov. 6, where the bears stepped in to stall the up-move.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/72f74c25-d61f-4975-938d-0fc96f2d018e.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sellers will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($232), which is a necessary level to keep an eye on. </p><p>If the price rebounds off this level with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity. The BNB/USDT pair could then travel to $265, where the bears may again pose a substantial challenge.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bears are back in the game.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) climbed above the $0.67 resistance on Nov. 6, but the bulls could not surmount the next barrier at $0.74.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/499b26db-eaca-40bd-9924-0d43d1fbd442.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>That may have tempted short-term bulls to book profits, which pulled the price below $0.67 on Nov. 7. The long tail on the day’s candlestick shows that lower levels continue to attract buyers. If the price remains above $0.63, it will improve the prospects of a retest of $0.74. Above this level, the XRP/USDT pair may rise to $0.85 and then to $1.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below $0.63, it will signal that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair could then slip to the 20-day EMA ($0.60).</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) has been consolidating in an uptrend. The price is stuck between the overhead resistance at $48 and the support at $38. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/85ad69bf-75ac-48ab-967d-594a831f5a0f.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart.

The price could climb to $48, which may witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If bulls overcome this obstacle, the SOL/USDT pair could jump to $60.</p><p>If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($36.30). That could start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($27.35). </p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days. The price reached $0.38 on Nov. 6, where the bulls are likely to face solid resistance from the bears.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/054293c6-705e-4c8b-b13f-d8d150d94559.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The price pulled back on Nov. 7, but a minor positive is that the bulls purchased at lower levels, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. Buying indicates that the bulls expect the overhead resistance to be scaled.</p><p>If buyers drive and sustain the price above $0.38, the ADA/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $0.42 and subsequently to $0.46. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $0.33.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Buyers are trying to shove Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) above $0.08. The previous attempt in July had fizzled out at this level; hence, the bears will again try to guard $0.08 with vigor.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/3e76fc4a-4935-41eb-80cb-65f48d2f3eb0.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.07) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If buyers do not give up much ground from $0.08, it will increase the likelihood of a break above it. The DOGE/USDT pair could then surge toward the psychologically crucial level of $0.10.</p><p>If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to swiftly yank the price back below the 20-day EMA. That could signal a range-bound action between $0.06 and $0.08 for some time.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/toncoin-ton-price-11-month-high-telegram-giveaways\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/toncoin-ton-price-11-month-high-telegram-giveaways/amp\"><strong><em>Toncoin (TON) price skyrockets to 11-month high after Telegram launches 'Giveaways'</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) surged above the overhead resistance of $2.59 on Nov. 8, indicating that bulls are in control.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/1bc5b8e5-f095-4a9f-b51f-b891c89fc615.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">TON/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that quickly, it may trap several aggressive bulls who could rush to the exit.

After a brief consolidation, the bulls asserted their supremacy and resumed the up-move on Nov. 5.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/c2a275fd-71db-4872-878b-e2bbe8be5bf9.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LINK/USDT daily chart.

If buyers bulldoze their way through, the LINK/USDT pair may jump to $15 and thereafter to $18. The bears are expected to fiercely defend this level.</p><p>The vital support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($11.18). A break and close below this support will indicate that the bullish momentum may be reducing. </p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) pierced the overhead resistance at $0.70 on Nov. 6, indicating that the bulls are in the driver’s seat.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/d35e8556-e21a-43f1-b3c2-1bffcfdde345.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart.

This suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That started the next leg of the uptrend toward $0.80. This level may act as a minor hurdle, but if crossed, the MATIC/USDT pair could reach $0.90.</p><p>The rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, cautioning of a possible consolidation or correction in the near term.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-parabolic-rally-600000/",
    "description": "The argument for the Bitcoin price to reach above $200,000 has been going on for a few years now with a number of crypto pundits maintaining their stance. This has not changed, especially with the most recent prediction from one crypto analyst who puts the BTC price above $200,000. But what’s most interesting is the timeframe in which this analyst expects the leading crypto to reach this level. Halving To Trigger Parabolic Rally Crypto analyst TradingShot posted another eye-catching prediction on the TradingView website, putting the Bitcoin price as high as $200,000. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin Vortex bullish cross as well as the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW) bottoms to gauge when BTC might go on its next parabolic rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Climbs Above $0.075 To 3-Month High, But Metrics Show It’s Far From Done TradingShot explains that a parabolic rally for the cryptocurrency often starts after a Halving Event. Now, a BTC halving event takes place roughly every four years and it’s an event in which the block rewards for miners are cut down in half, thereby reducing the rate at which new coins are being brought into circulation. The crypto analyst’s prediction in this instance uses the next Bitcoin halving event which is expected to take place sometime in Q2 2024. As the analyst explains, this is an event that “starts the (final and most aggressive) Parabolic Rally sequence of the Bull Cycle.” Source: Tradingview.com One other important event that happens after the halving takes place is the BBW which bottoms once the halving is completed. This often marks the end of a short downtrend, and “may have as a Support a (dotted) Lower Lows trend-line,” as TradingShot explains. When Will Bitcoin Cross $200,000 The expectation for the BBW to bottom out in early 2024 carries the basis for a Bitcoin parabolic rally above $200,000. Once it does this, there is only a short timeframe that the crypto analyst sees before the asset is able to reach this level. A Bullish Cross formation as has been the case historically, is expected to trigger “a long-term sequence of straight green candles (Parabolic Rally) straight to the Bull Cycle&#8217;s peak.” This marks the beginning of the bull market. Related Reading: Why Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Picks Bitcoin Over Cash And Gold TradingShot explains that if this happens, then the Bullish Cross would appear on the 2-Month (2M) candle. This will put the timeframe in the vicinity of January 2024. If this analysis is correct, then BTC could be only a few months away from making a new all-time high. At the upper band of this parabolic rally, Bitcoin sits above $650,000. Given that BTC is currently trading just above $35,300, it would mean an over 1,700% rally.
