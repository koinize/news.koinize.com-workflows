    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/crypto-research-firm-says-sell-all-your-cardano-ada/",
    "description": "K33 Research, a prominent entity in the cryptocurrency research sector, has released a scathing report on Cardano (ADA), sparking widespread discussion in the crypto community. The report bluntly advises investors to divest from Cardano, citing a lack of meaningful use for its native token, ADA. Sell All ADA Now? In a detailed examination, K33 Research asserts that the Cardano network suffers from a significant lack of practical application, which is essential for the inherent value of its native token. The report states, &#8220;A smart contract network needs meaningful use for its native token to have any value. The Cardano network, however, has no meaningful use or any credible track to get it.&#8221; Addressing the counterargument often presented by Cardano supporters regarding the network&#8217;s daily transactions averaging around 90,000, the report argues that these do not equate to meaningful blockchain activity. The report further elaborates, &#8220;There’s nothing else going on in the Cardano Network than exchange transfers and a group of bagholders fabricating blockchain activity.&#8221; Related Reading: Cardano’s 2024 Kickoff: First Two Weeks Show Major Updates, Report K33 Research highlights the absence of external evidence supporting any significant activity on the Cardano network, contrasting it with other protocols where real activity is corroborated by external proofs. This lack of external validation is termed as &#8216;proof by contradiction&#8217; by the research firm. One of the most telling indicators of inactivity, according to the report, is the situation of stablecoins on the Cardano network. K33 Research points out that the absence of major stablecoins like USDT and USDC on Cardano is a clear indicator that no meaningful decentralized finance (DeFi) activities are taking place. The only stablecoins present are reportedly Cardano-collateralized and valued at 76 cents to the dollar, which it refers to as &#8220;another word for nothing.&#8221; Future Outlook For Cardano K33 Research is pessimistic about Cardano&#8217;s future, drawing parallels with other blockchain projects that started with no traction and later faded into irrelevance. The report notes that successful blockchains evolve over time, whereas &#8220;creationistic, grand idea, subsidized bootstrapping, and no real use-blockchains&#8221; eventually lose their luster. It cites examples like IOTA, NEO, and EOS to illustrate this pattern. Related Reading: Is Cardano The Next Solana? Institutional Investors Clamor For ADA Exposure Despite Cardano&#8217;s current market valuation of $19 billion, K33 Research attributes this to its availability on various exchanges and its appeal to new crypto investors. The report critiques the narrative surrounding Cardano, describing it as &#8220;scientific mumbo-jumbo&#8221; that might mislead newcomers. &#8220;Ada is a well-established coin that is tradeable ‘everywhere’, also on smaller local exchanges, making it one of the coins that are &#8216;pushed&#8217; to aspiring crypto investors. Cardano also has an enticing story for newcomers, with Cardano being branded as &#8216;the peer-reviewed research-driven blockchain network&#8217;,&#8221; the report mentions. However, K33 Research foresees a decline in this allure, predicting that the number of new investors attracted to Cardano will dwindle. Moreover, K33 Research casts doubt on the long-term viability of ADA, citing a lack of rally in its price compared to other strong smart contract tokens during recent market rallies. &#8220;Ada has not rallied in line with other &#8216;stronger&#8217; smart contract tokens when markets have improved,&#8221; the report states, suggesting a gradual fade from relevance rather than an abrupt disappearance. According to K33 Research, the market doesn&#8217;t rapidly eliminate such coins but instead &#8220;bleeds them out&#8221; over time. The report concludes, &#8220;Things never happen overnight, and these processes often take years to play out fully. Still, all price signals also point to Ada gradually disappearing from the crypto map.&#8221; At press time, ADA traded at $0.531. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-classic-maintains-32-steady-rise-whats-driving-etc-up/",
    "description": "The recent approval of the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, triggering a significant surge in various altcoins, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) taking the spotlight. Often overshadowed by its more well-known sibling, Ethereum, ETC has emerged as the clear winner in the aftermath of the groundbreaking news, experiencing an impressive surge of over 31% in the past seven days. Related Reading: Solid TVL Slingshots SUI Price To Break $1 For New All-Time High – Details Ethereum Classic Trading Volume Up Since the SEC&#8217;s approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF on January 10th, Ethereum Classic has skyrocketed by a staggering 30%, currently maintaining a trading value around $26. This meteoric rise has been accompanied by a remarkable 270% increase in trading volume, soaring to a substantial $1.8 billion. Such robust figures underscore a palpable surge in investor confidence, suggesting the potential for further gains in the near future. While Bitcoin itself witnessed a modest price increase, briefly touching $47,000, Ethereum stole the limelight by breaking a 20-month barrier and surpassing $2,600. Ethereum Classic currently trading at $26.36 on the daily chart: TradingView.com This remarkable 10% surge within a mere 24 hours has positioned Ethereum at its highest value since May 2022. Analysts attribute this impressive performance to Ethereum&#8217;s robust underlying technology and recent network upgrades, cementing its status as a favorable option for investors after Bitcoin. The approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF is not the sole catalyst for this altcoin rally; the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for later in the year, is also playing a pivotal role in bolstering bullish sentiment. ETC price action in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko This event, occurring approximately every four years, involves a reduction in the number of newly minted Bitcoins and has historically coincided with price appreciation in the cryptocurrency market. The confluence of these factors has created a perfect storm for Ethereum Classic, propelling it towards the coveted $30 mark. ETC Strong Performance Industry experts anticipate that this milestone may be achieved soon, fueled by Ethereum Classic&#8217;s impressive trading volume and market capitalization, which has surged by 34% to cross the $4 billion mark since the ETF news broke. Related Reading: Chainlink Rises 17% – Is LINK On Course To Hit $20 This Week? However, amidst the euphoria surrounding this surge, it remains crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the impending halving event offer promising prospects, unforeseen factors can swiftly alter market dynamics. The recent ascent of Ethereum Classic serves as a compelling testament to the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market and the substantial impact of major regulatory decisions. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other altcoins respond to these developments and whether Ethereum Classic can sustain its lead in this post-ETF era.
