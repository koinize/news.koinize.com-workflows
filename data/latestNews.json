History Of Polygon Polygon, initially launched as Matic Network in 2017, was developed to address critical blockchain scaling and usability issues. In May 2020, the Matic Network debuted its mainnet on Ethereum. During this phase, the network was predominantly managed by the Matic Foundation, which gradually began to onboard third-party validators for decentralized control. The network underwent a significant transformation in February 2021, rebranding to Polygon. This change marked an expansion of its capabilities, including the integration of ZK-rollup technologies and various other scalability solutions. Following this, the project continued its momentum by acquiring technologies like Hermez and Mir Protocol, and launching initiatives such as Polygon ID in June 2022 and Polygon Supernets in October 2022. The introduction of Polygon zkEVM in March 2023 further cemented its commitment to enhancing scalability and privacy. What Is Polygon 2.0? Polygon 2.0, announced on June 12, 2023, represents a series of proposed upgrades aimed at unifying all Polygon protocols under the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology umbrella. This ambitious plan includes upgrading the PoS network to a zkEVM Validium network, which uniquely stores transaction data off-chain, maintained by the network&#8217;s validators. The initiation of Polygon 2.0&#8217;s &#8220;Phase 0&#8221; on September 14, 2023, marked the beginning of implementing these upgrades. This phase was driven by the release of several critical Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) that laid out the foundational changes for the network&#8217;s transformation. These proposals aimed to ensure that existing users and developers on the network would not be immediately affected, ensuring a smooth transition. MATIC Becomes POL A cornerstone of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade is the transition from the existing MATIC token to the new POL token. This transition was officially set in motion with the POL token contract going live on the Goerli testnet on October 4, 2023. The POL token is designed to serve as the native token of the upgraded ecosystem, supporting a variety of roles across the ZK-based L2 chains. The POL token starts with a supply of 10 billion, allowing for a one-to-one migration from MATIC, and features an annual emission rate of 2%. This emission is strategically planned to support validator staking rewards and contribute to a community treasury, emphasizing a balanced and sustainable network growth.

Polygon Price Prediction The 1-week chart of MATIC/USD depicts the most crucial levels in the medium to long term. For the analysis of these price levels, we use Fibonacci retracement levels and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to identify potential support and resistance levels. Fibonacci Retracement Levels: 0.236 Level (Approximately $0.92): This level, derived from the Fibonacci retracement, is a potential resistance zone. If the price of MATIC approaches this level, traders might expect some selling pressure, as it&#8217;s a common retracement level where price reversals can occur. 0.382 Level (Approximately $1.29): This is another key resistance level. A break above this could signal strong bullish momentum, possibly leading to higher price levels. 0.5 Level (Approximately $1.59): The halfway point of the Fibonacci retracement levels is considered a psychological level of market sentiment. It may serve as a strong resistance level where the price could face considerable challenges. 0.618 Level (Approximately $1.89): Often referred to as the &#8216;golden ratio,&#8217; this level is crucial. If the price were to move past this point, it might indicate a potential trend reversal from previous declines. 0.786 Level (Approximately $2.32): Approaching this higher retracement level typically indicates a substantial recovery from past downtrends, signifying that the price is nearing the previous highs from which it retraced. Exponential Moving Averages: 20-Week EMA: MATIC has recently breached the 20-week EMA at $0.65, which it had been trailing below since mid-April 2023. This move indicates a potential shift in short-term sentiment from bearish to bullish. 50-Week EMA: The price is currently approaching the 50-week EMA at $0.77, a crucial resistance level that traders often watch. If MATIC can sustain above this level, it might confirm a stronger bullish trend over the medium term. 100 and 200-Week EMAs: These longer-term EMAs represent more substantial levels of support and resistance and could indicate the overall health of the market. A breach above the 100-week EMA (approximately $0.95) would be a strong bullish signal, while the 200-week EMA would be indicative of a long-term bullish reversal. Current Status As of November 7, MATIC is trading around $0.7087, having recently conquered the 20-week EMA. The next critical level for MATIC to test is the 50-week EMA. If it successfully breaks and holds above this level, the next significant resistance would be at the 0.236 Fibonacci level of $0.92. These levels, coupled with market sentiment and fundamental developments within the ecosystem, will be pivotal in determining MATIC&#8217;s price trajectory in the coming weeks and months.
