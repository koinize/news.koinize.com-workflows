    "description": "<p>In recent weeks, the crypto market has traveled through a bumpy road, with its fair share of ups and downs. For one, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have introduced new updates to improve their shaky position.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the same time, Tradecurve (TCRV) launch has captured a lot of attention. This new project has become an instant hit due to its uniqueness, and enormous growth potential. Its ongoing presale has broken records.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>\nCardano&rsquo;s (ADA) Network Activity Falls\n<p>The Cardano (ADA) community is hopeful that the recent developments in its ecosystem, including the release of a novel Dynamic P2P networking scheme, will increase the traction on the network. Dynamic P2P has been launched to bring scalability and modularity to the Cardano network. However, experts have raised concerns over the latest on-chain data related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As per Santiment&rsquo;s data, the number of daily active addresses on the Cardano network has plummeted by 71% in the past month. The social dominance of Cardano has also taken a hit. Subsequently, the exchange rate of Cardano has suffered a drop of 23% in the last 30 days. At press time, Cardano is available to change hands at $0.29.</p>\n<p></p>\nSolana (SOL) Aims To Benefit From Firedancer\n<p>To get out of the clutches of bears, and prevent its price from falling further, Solana (SOL) has shifted its focus to the NFT space. This shift in focus has come as Solana has taken a dip of 11% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, the current exchange rate of Solana is $19.19, which is 93% below its peak of $260.06. However, the new validator client for Solana, Firedancer, is expected to provide market support to SOL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As per the data from Messari, Firedancer can lower latency times on the Solana network, enhancing DeFi maturity. This, in turn, will enable faster transaction processing on Solana, attracting more users to the network. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out the declining TVL of Solana.</p>\n<p></p>\nTradecurve Presale Becomes More Appealing With 50x Growth\n<p>According to data, about 5 new cryptocurrencies enter the market every day, and there are more than 26,000 digital currencies in circulation. Subsequently, crypto trading has also boomed. However, existing crypto exchanges have been criticized for their high fees, limited investment options, and data insecurity. To address these issues, and meet dynamic market demands, Tradecurve (TCRV) has launched a disruptive crypto exchange.</p>\n<p>This new Web3 trading platform enables users to invest in different markets, such as forex, equity, cryptocurrency, CFDs, and more, with a single account. What is more exciting for traders is the platform&rsquo;s privacy feature. It does not require users to fulfill any KYC requirements. Contrary to this, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood mandate users to share their private details.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the platform boasts high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1, and a VIP account service.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/whales-and-institutional-investors-acquire-over-47-billion-of-bitcoin-btc-inqubeta-qube-poised-for-1000-growth-in-2023",
    "description": "<p class=\"s5\">In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, two significant developments have taken center stage, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. InQubeta (QUBE) stands out as a revolutionary cryptocurrency, seamlessly integrating the realms of crypto, AI technology, and profitability. Simultaneously, Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a remarkable surge in market performance, fueled by the accumulation of over $4.7 billion worth of Bitcoin by whales and institutional investors.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">The success of InQubeta's ongoing live presale, coupled with its diverse ecosystem encompassing high-profit potential and popular NFTs, makes InQubeta poised for 1000% growth in 2023. This projected growth is also thanks to InQubeta's focus on facilitating the crowdfunding of AI startups and providing a secure, transparent, and rewarding platform for every investor.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Let's explore how InQubeta is poised for 1000% growth in 2023 while whales and institutional investors acquire over $4.7 billion of Bitcoin.</p>\nInQubeta (QUBE) Effectively Leverages Crypto, Profitability, and AI Synergy\n<p class=\"s5\">InQubeta is an outstanding crypto platform that highlights blockchain technology and AI innovation. It facilitates the connection between AI startups and investors to actualize its fundraising mission for beginner AI companies. The second stage of the ongoing InQubetapresale is witnessing remarkable momentum, attracting many investors eager to acquire QUBE tokens at a market-friendly rate of $0.0098 per token. InQubeta has sold over 174 million QUBE tokens and raised over $1.3 million.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">InQubeta's high-profit guarantee convinces investors of its capability to experience 1000% growth before the end of 2023. InQubeta aims to maximize returns and provide enticing rewards for investors in the DeFi market. InQubeta's native QUBE coin operates on a deflationary model, strategically reducing its supply to instill a sense of exclusivity and scarcity among QUBE token holders, encouraging them to hold their tokens for future gains. Holding QUBE tokens presents an opportunity to accrue 300% profits on investments due to the appreciating value of the QUBE coin throughout the presale.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">InQubeta's engaging NFT marketplace contributes to its potential to grow by 1000% in 2023. This virtual marketplace serves as a space for AI startups to exhibit their curated collections of popular NFTs. The unique NFTs attract QUBE investors to actively support their preferred AI startups by purchasing NFT assets. As an incentive, AI startups can offer discounts on products and services or rewards as equity-based NFTs, further solidifying InQubeta's reputation as one of the best DeFi investment prospects.</p>\n<p class=\"s8\"></p>\nBitcoin (BTC) Rises in Value Following a Surge in Accumulation\n<p class=\"s5\">Bitcoin utilizes its native BTC token to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity as a pioneering crypto project many cryptocurrencies imitate. Between late June and July 4, 2023, whales and institutional investors in the BTC cryptocurrency actively amassed billions of dollars of Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Their holdings ranged from 10 to 10,000 BTC, totaling over 154,600 BTC and yielding over $4.7 billion.</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">This surge in accumulation occurred after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed for a spot in the Bitcoin project's exchange-traded fund (ETF). Afterward, the BTC token recorded heightened trading activity, propelling the price of each Bitcoin to rise above $31,000, reaching a new yearly high. Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has speculated that this progressive price trend may lead to the value of the BTC token possibly surpassing $300,000 in the future.</p>\nConclusion\n<p class=\"s5\">Investors and enthusiasts in the DeFi market are intrigued by the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by whales and institutional investors and the promising growth of InQubeta's QUBE coin. The influx of billions of dollars into Bitcoin's funding showcases the continued interest and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency, with price predictions reaching new highs. Conversely, InQubeta's unique combination of crypto, profitability, and AI technology positions it as one of the best DeFi cryptocurrencies, with a projected growth of 1000% in 2023.</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">Visit InQubeta Presale</p>\n<p>Join The InQubeta Communities</p>\n<p class=\"s5\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its finalized global regulatory framework for crypto assets. </p>\n<p>On Monday, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its recommendations for a global regulatory framework for crypto-assets to &ldquo;promote the comprehensiveness and international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches.&rdquo;</p>\nFSB Bases Framework on Principle of &ldquo;Same Activity, Same Risk, Same Regulation&rdquo; &nbsp;\n<p>The FSB is an international organization that monitors the global financial system. The organization published guidelines for a global approach to crypto-related activities.</p>\n<p>The board was tasked by the Group of 20 Nations (G20) to coordinate the delivery of an effective regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework for crypto-assets in light of recent events that took place in the digital asset industry.</p>\n<p>The G20 previously said in a document summarizing the outcomes of meetings held with finance ministers and central bank governors that the FSB, IMF (International Monetary Fund), and BIS (Bank for International Settlements) are to deliver papers and recommendations establishing standards for a global crypto regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>The FSB&rsquo;s document consists of two sets of recommendations: high-level recommendations for crypto regulation in general and &ldquo;revised high-level recommendations&rdquo; for a &ldquo;global stablecoin.&rdquo;</p>\nFSB Maintains Respect for Privacy\n<p>According to the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations, crypto platforms must segregate clients&rsquo; digital assets from their own funds and must clearly separate their functions to avoid conflicts of interest. Regulators are responsible for ensuring tight cross-border cooperation and oversight.</p>\n<p>Despite stricter oversight measures, the FSB respects the principle of privacy. The international organization demands local regulators to ensure that there is no activity that &ldquo;may frustrate the identification of the responsible entity or affiliated entities.&rdquo; the regulator points to DeFi protocols in its recommendation of privacy and states:</p>\n\n<p>Authorities should have access to the data as necessary and appropriate to fulfil their regulatory, supervisory and oversight mandates.</p>\n\nFSB Requires Stablecoin Issuers to Have At least One &ldquo;Governance Body&rdquo;\n<p>In its guidelines, the FSB addressed global stablecoin arrangements (GSCs) across jurisdictions to address their potential risks at a domestic and international level while supporting responsible innovation and providing adequate flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic approaches.</p>\n<p>The board mandates any stablecoin issuer to have one or more identifiable and responsible individuals or legal entities it calls a &ldquo;governance body.&rdquo; It further requires issuers to maintain minimum reserve assets at a 1:1 ratio unless the issuer &ldquo;is subject to adequate prudential requirements&rdquo; equivalent to commercial bank standards.</p>\n<p>The FSB also introduced a potential obligation for &ldquo;global stablecoin&rdquo; issuers to obtain a permit to operate in each jurisdiction. Guidelines state:</p>\n\n<p>Authorities should not permit the operation of a GSC arrangement in their jurisdiction unless the GSC arrangement meets all of their jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory, supervisory, and oversight requirements, including affirmative approval.</p>\n\nImplementation of Recommendations To Be Reviewed by End 2025\n<p>The guidelines published by the FSB make up the first part of a global crypto framework, with further guidance from the IMF and BIS to come.</p>\n<p>The FSB and the IMF will jointly submit &ldquo;a synthesis paper integrating the macroeconomic and regulatory perspectives of crypto assets&rdquo; in September 2023.</p>\n<p>The IMF will also independently report on the &ldquo;potential macro-financial implications of the widespread adoption&rdquo; of CBDCs. At the same time, the BIS will provide a report on analytical and conceptual issues and possible risk mitigation strategies related to crypto assets.</p>\n<p>The FSB said it will review the state of implementing its recommendations worldwide by the end of 2025.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius-is-selling-more-pain-for-bnb-link-and-snx/",
    "description": "Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender, has started selling its non-Bitcoin and non-Ethereum crypto assets, records on July 17 indicate. According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, Celsius has transferred approximately $23.5 million of various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ZRX, LINK, BONE, and SNX, to FalconX and OKX, respectively. Different amounts of these tokens were transferred by Celsius, a move that, while it could be positive for creditors, may impact the token valuations of those projects. Celsius Selling Altcoins  Lookonchain revealed that Celsius moved $8.5 million worth of LINK, the native currency of Chainlink, a middleware protocol linking on-chain smart contracts to external but verified data. At the same time, it also moved $7.84 million worth of SNX, the native token of Synthetix, a protocol allowing users to trade derivatives called synths, was transferred. Celsius also went on to move $3 million worth of BNB, the coin behind the sprawling Binance ecosystem, $2.26 million worth of 1INCH, the token aggregator, and $1.9 million worth of ZRX, the token behind one of the first decentralized finance platforms, Ox Protocol. The bankrupt lender also moved $709,678 worth of FTT, the token behind the collapsed FTX exchange, to FalconX. In response, FalconX has started depositing these tokens to Binance for selling. Related Reading: $18 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Accumulated At $30,200 – BTC Bull Run Incoming? The only token moved to a different exchange was BONE, where Celsius moved $235,000 of the meme token to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, OKX. While OKX caters to retail and institutional investors, FalconX serves institutional investors, offering diverse services, including liquidity provision and risk management. So far, a large tranche of tokens held by Celsius has moved through FalconX. In late June, Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York allowed Celsius to start converting all their tokens to either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two currencies that would be allowed to pay back creditors. All conversions were set to begin on July 1. Altcoins Taking A Hit The transfer also comes amid a favorable ruling that saw a US Judge say XRP, one of the major altcoins, is not a security and can be traded like a commodity, just like Bitcoin. However, even though news pumped altcoins, mostly XRP, momentum tapered during the weekend, and most altcoins fell back from last week&#8217;s highs.

The coin currently oscillates within a $30 range as bears dominate price action. From the daily chart, BNB has resistance at $260 and is down over 30% from April 2023 highs.  LINK and SNX are seeing similar price actions, both recording losses on the 24-hour chart. LINK is down 2.97% to be trading at $6.63, while SNX is nursing 3.94% losses, bringing its price to $2.64. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
