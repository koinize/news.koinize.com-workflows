William Mapan, whose 250-piece Distance collection just sold out at 2ETH each, explains using a crayon and die.</p>\n                    <p><p><strong>Generative artist William Mapans latest collection, “Distance,” sold out in less than 24 hours despite launching in the middle of a very weak NFT market.</strong></p><p>From his early long-form generative series “<a href=\"https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/dragons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Dragons</a>” on the Tezos blockchain to the highly sought-after “Anticyclone ArtBlocks collection that currently commands a 5 ETH floor, Mapan has a unique way of capturing the hearts and minds of collectors.<br><br>But many people in the public still dont understand what generative art even is. Mapan has a unique way of explaining the often misunderstood genre by boiling it down to a piece of paper, a crayon and a die.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It can be really hard to explain but usually the way I explain is to put away the code, put away the blockchain, put away everything. Just take a piece of paper, a crayon and dice. Imagine drawing two by two boxes on that paper, so four boxes total. You then throw the dice  if the roll shows up as a three or below, you draw a square; if the dice shows four or above, you draw a circle into one of the boxes.</p></blockquote><p>You just made an algorithm; you just made a set of rules and introduced some randomness in there. Thats basically what generative art is, you build a set of rules, an algorithm and then introduce randomness. Then you try to control that part of the space.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Strands-of-Solitude-010-by-William-Mapan-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Strands of Solitude #010 by William Mapan\" class=\"wp-image-23995\" width=\"299\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Strands-of-Solitude-010-by-William-Mapan-Medium.jpeg 360w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Strands-of-Solitude-010-by-William-Mapan-Medium-169x300.jpeg 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Strands of Solitude #010 by William Mapan (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the grid of two by two, the parameter of space is very reduced, but as soon as you expand to different parameters, you can get many different outputs.

You just write down your rules and just follow them, and thats it.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fine-line-technique\">Fine line technique</h2><p>Mapans work straddles the line between appearing as if its physically or digitally made, a technique other artists such as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/fidenza-tyler-hobbs-wrote-a-program-to-make-art-that-is-now-worth-millions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Tyler Hobbs</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/creating-organic-generative-art-from-robotic-algorithims-emily-xie-nft-creator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Emily Xiu</a> have a reputation for.</p><p>I like to activate senses, feelings and memories.

He kindly explained it all to me, and it started to make sense over time. I started in the Tezos ecosystem, which was a very community art-driven vibe, Mapan says.</p><p>It intrigued me that you could put an algorithm on the blockchain, and when people mint it, they buy an iteration that triggers your algorithm on demand. It was a new way to think about your work.

One of the bills would stop the Federal Reserve from running any test programs on CBDCs without congressional approval, while the other would stop federal banks from using CBDCs for some services and products. </p><p>The principal political adversaries to a digital dollar are heavyweights such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who have thrown their hats into the ring to become president a year from November. </p><p>In July, DeSantis said that CBDCs would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ron-desantis-vows-to-ban-cdbc-in-the-us\">never happen under his administration</a>, citing concerns over consumers losing power over their own money. Kennedy, on the other hand, a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-invested-up-to-250-000-in-bitcoin-after-miami-conference\">known proponent of Bitcoin</a>, is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rfk-jr-elaborates-position-on-cbdc-crypto-it-isn-t-just-criminals-who-want-privacy\">rallying against the digital dollar</a> as it will “vastly magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke.“</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">No CBDC in Florida <a href=\"https://t.co/p9pwSTmrlN\">https://t.co/p9pwSTmrlN</a></p>&mdash; Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1637818887382396928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In May, Cointelegraph reported that according to its own research, more than 130 countries were <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/state-of-cbdc-report-by-cointelegraph-research\">at some stage of research into a CBDC</a>, and only eight had rejected the idea outright. These countries are diverse, from France and Switzerland to Haiti and Bhutan. So, the question must be asked: Why would a country like the United States be so opposed to having its own digital currency?</p><p>The idea of a CBDC in itself is nothing too taxing. In essence, digital dollars would be based on blockchain technology rather than having traditional dollars moving around between accounts. That would dramatically decrease transfer times, cut fees, and do away with the “middlemen” — the intermediaries along the way who slow things down and take a cut for themselves. </p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that in 2021, there were still 5.9 million “unbanked’ households in the United States, a massive number by any standard.</p><p>A CBDC would mean that the Federal Reserve would effectively oversee all the bank transfers in the country, as there would be no alternative. And having everything under one roof means one mistake or failure would affect everyone rather than be limited to one bank, for instance. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-state-governments-spur-blockchain-adoption-in-public-administration\">Indian state governments spur blockchain adoption in public administration</a></em></strong></p><p>But perhaps the biggest argument against a CBDC is that, for cryptocurrency purists, having a central institution overseeing a currency is the very thing crypto was designed to avoid. Why now make a U-turn?</p><p>Political motivations play a significant role in the discussion in the United States. In March 2022, President Joseph Biden said his administration would “place the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC.” </p><p>This provided fodder for the Republican party to come out against the plan, citing invasion of privacy and claiming it was another form of government control. DeSantis even came out with an Orwellian prediction of the government stopping its citizens from buying fossil fuels or guns if such legislation were in place.</p><p>This is not to say that the U.S. hasn’t looked into a CBDC, as it has extensively. </p><p>In 2020, the Federal Reserve launched <a href=\"https://dci.mit.edu/project-hamilton-building-a-hypothetical-cbdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Project Hamilton</a> to study the viability of a CBDC. By 2022, it had developed a system that took elements from the workings of Bitcoin but moved away from its rigid blockchain backbone. The result was a system that can <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59aae5e9a803bb10bedeb03e/t/61fc25f91a0df9037488eb7d/1643914745989/Hamilton.Whitepaper-2022-02-02-FINAL2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">process</a> 1.7 million transactions per second, light years ahead of the Bitcoin blockchain and quicker even than Visa, which can deal with about 65,000 transactions per second.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DM-94zQ-hZY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>David Millar, data center coordinator at Santander, told Cointelegraph: “The leaps forward they made during Project Hamilton were truly staggering. When we heard of the progress they were making, we believed that our entire infrastructure would need to be completely revamped within the next five years.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the project completed its initial phase in December 2022 and went no further. Once again, voices of dissent from Congress attacked the project, saying it had been carried out solely with academics and the public sector in mind and the average citizen would not benefit. Millar added: </p><blockquote>“The time and effort that went into Hamilton and the results they produced; it’s a tragedy that most of it will never see the light of day.”</blockquote><p>The issue of privacy is one of the most prominent foes of the digital dollar. The main argument of the dissenters is that if there is to be a digital dollar, it should effectively be like the cash dollar is now, with its benefits of anonymity coupled with the power and speed of a cryptocurrency. Those who favor a digital dollar argue that we already have such a thing, but it’s just not called that yet. Credit card money is digital for all intents and purposes, and are any of us mailing cash to Amazon to pay for things? </p><p>The world is moving toward a cashless society, and the U.S. is no exception. In 2022, only 18% of all U.S. <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2023/may/2023-findings-from-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">payments were made in cash</a>, down from 31% in 2016. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-killed-translation-industry-easytranslate-boss-change-human-jobs/\">‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change</a></em></strong></p><p>The U.S. is also a country of strange contradictions. While it surges ahead in many areas, such as technology, its banking system remains rooted in the traditional, with check payments still being the norm. Dragging a whole nation away from that is a tall order.</p><p>So, what does the future hold for a potential U.S. CBDC? Well, very little. Project Hamilton closed with no indication of a second phase, and according to <a href=\"https://www.darrellduffie.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Darrell Duffie</a>, a professor of finance at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, while work is continuing, it has slowed to a snail’s pace, and “nobody is charging ahead openly.” </p><p>It seems for the foreseeable future, this will be one part of the cryptosphere where the U.S. is not a pioneer. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

The token name &amp; other parameters are designed to be passed in by values given by GPT in the code's constructor.”</blockquote><p>CroissantETH also explained how ChatGPT’s first attempts at potential names for its ERC-20 token were not ideal. The developer’s solution was to integrate data from the top traded Uniswap tokens to give the LLM a more natural sounding output.</p><blockquote>“GPT-4 evidently had a much better understanding of crypto culture while also offering its own creativity in responses.”</blockquote><p>To ensure the token was made solely by GPT before deploying the contract, CroissantETH addressed ownership of the private keys and the contract contract with a solution that rules out any human intervention.</p><blockquote>“Once the contract is deployed, ownership is immediately revoked and 100% of the tokens are added alongside 2 ETH to liquidity on Uniswap upon creation.”</blockquote><p>Thus AstroPepeX (APX) was created by ChatGPT, sending 65,000,000,000 APX tokens and 2 Ether (ETH) in liquidity to Uniswap’s decentralized exchange.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s time to let GPT takeover.<br><br>I just ran the script, &amp; it created:<br><br>AstroPepeX<br><br>65,000,000,000<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$APX</a><br><br>0xed4e879087ebD0e8A77d66870012B5e0dffd0Fa4<br><br>(Note: There is a require condition that limits transfers &gt;0.5% of the supply)<br><br>Enjoy! <a href=\"https://t.co/FjoQpDdhM3\">pic.twitter.com/FjoQpDdhM3</a></p>&mdash; ‍.eth (@CroissantEth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CroissantEth/status/1704261552730214581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Using exclusive access to blockchain analysis tools from Nansen 2’s beta, Cointelegraph confirmed that APX tokens have indeed moved onto DeFi platforms like Poloniex and centralized exchanges including Bitget, MEXC and LBank.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/b5cb3812-a225-4e4f-8559-f31777834dbe.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Nansen 2 beta's Token God Mode dashboard for the AstroPepeX token.</figcaption></figure><p>Poloniex also promoted the listing of the token on X (previously Twitter), opening deposits and trading on its exchange on Sept. 21.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AstroPepeX <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/APX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#APX</a> is Poloniex newest listing! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CroissantEth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CroissantEth</a><br><br>Deposit will be opened on September 21st, 12:00 (UTC)<br><br>September 21st (UTC), Post-only mode will be enabled on 12:00 &amp; Full trading will be enabled on 13:00<a href=\"https://t.co/d17DLkFcUL\">https://t.co/d17DLkFcUL</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewListing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NewListing</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#crypto</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zzKPVFSVoZ\">pic.twitter.com/zzKPVFSVoZ</a></p>&mdash; Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1704827511463674023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>AstroPepeX’s website links to its Ethereum address and social media handles.
