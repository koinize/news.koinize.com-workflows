Cointelegraph examines whether bulls or bears will have the upper hand.</p>\n                    <p><p>Bitcoin's (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) market is preparing for a $10.1 billion options expiry, a significant event set to occur on Dec. 29 at 8:00 am ET. The latest data indicates that call (buy) options hold a clear advantage, but bears could significantly limit their losses by pushing Bitcoin's price below $42,000.</p><p>Both sides have incentives to influence Bitcoin's spot price, but as the deadline approaches, one can gauge the outcome based on the expiry price. The options market leader, Deribit, boasts an impressive $7.7 billion open interest, but the surprise comes from the runner-up, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), with $1.38 billion. The CMEâ€™s open interest is more than double that of OKX, which is in third place with $630 million.</p><p>The impending approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January has a substantial impact on the December options expiry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notably changed its approach in how it engages with ETF proponents. Instead of outright rejections, the SEC has been actively <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-updates-deadline\">engaging in dialogue with ETF creators</a>. This shift in approach is a positive signal and raises expectations of potential ETF approval in January. This alone explains why bears are unlikely to succeed in suppressing Bitcoin's price below $40,000 ahead of the year-end BTC options expiry.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-and-bears-prepare-for-end-of-year-10b-btc-options-expiry\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
