    "description": "<p>MuesliSwap, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Cardano blockchain, has taken the decision to refund users who faced unintended losses due to a \"misunderstanding\" regarding slippage mechanics within its platform.</p>\nRefunding Users Affected by High Slippage\n<p>The team behind MuesliSwap has acknowledged that users have been grappling with substantial slippage issues over the past year. On August 8, they openly admitted that they needed to adequately clarify the intricacies of the slippage feature in their protocol via a statement on X (formerly Twitter).</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To make amends, we will be refunding affected users who encountered high slippage on the MuesliSwap pools in the last 12 months from our project funds. Additionally, immediate action has been taken to remedy the slippage issue in the MuesliSwap order book&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>basically, MuesliSwap has pledged to refund users who have experienced high slippage within the past year. The team also promptly made adjustments to fix the slippage problem within the MuesliSwap order book.</p>\n<p>Affected users can expect the refund process to span up to four weeks. The funds will be automatically distributed based on an analysis of a user's on-chain trading history.</p>\nUnderstanding Slippage and Its Impact\n<p>Slippage, a concept widely recognized in trading, refers to the difference between the intended trade execution price and the actual price due to factors like market liquidity. DEX users can manually set a slippage threshold according to their comfort level.</p>\n<p>The Cardano-based DeFi, MuesliSwap's unique approach to slippage involved allowing decentralized matchmakers to either return the extra slippage amount or retain the difference, adding an extra layer of complexity. Unfortunately, this approach led to confusion, particularly among new users.The team has promised to remedy the situation so as to prevent similar confusion amongst users, stating,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Going forward, our DEX protocol will provide clear and accurate information on slippage when interacting with our pools. Your trading experience matters, and we're determined to make it seamless!&rdquo;</p>\n\nUser Concerns Across Cardano DEXs\n<p>Slippage concerns have been voiced across various DEXs operating on the Cardano network. A trader on August 4 highlighted the challenges of executing large trades due to substantial slippage, impacting overall trading value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The team also responded to another trader who enquired about the process, stating that all trade-related information would be fetched from the blockchain automatically and traders would not need to fill out any form to get the refund.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MuesliSwap's commitment to addressing slippage-related concerns reflects its dedication to refining the user experience and maintaining a transparent ecosystem for the Cardano community.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/whale-purchases-steth-in-the-past-day-reasons-why/",
    "description": "The crypto verse has recently witnessed a massive splash as an unidentified entity dove deep into the Ethereum ecosystem. A recent report from Lookonchain reveals that in a span of 24 hours, the whale has purchased $10 million worth of Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH). The Big Purchase And Past Activities Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, broke the news earlier today on their X (formerly known as Twitter) account revealing that a whale address was responsible for the withdrawal of 10 million Dai (DAI) from Maker. The smart whale withdrew 10M $DAI from @MakerDAO and bought 5,403 $stETH again at an average price of $1,851 6 hrs ago.https://t.co/rIWyjsfRpf pic.twitter.com/aGwmc46gmc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 10, 2023 According to the firm, this withdrawal wasn&#8217;t without purpose as the whale used the funds strategically invested to purchase 5,403 Lido Staked Ethereum, each at an average price of $1,851. Related Reading: Lido’s ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals For those tracing the activities of this whale, this isn&#8217;t a maiden voyage into the stETH seas. As reported by Lookonchain, this exact address recorded two hefty transactions on 24 July 2023. The first transaction saw the whale dispensing 5.17 million USD Coin (USDC) to acquire 2,802 stETH at a rate of $1,844 each. Not stopping there, the whale converted a subsequent 10 million USDC into 5,421 ETH, which was then fully transitioned to stETH. Possible Reasons For Buying stETH While the motives of crypto whales, just like their real-world counterparts, often remain beneath the surface and obscured from the prying eyes of small investors, given the nature of this particular whale&#8217;s stETH acquisitions, it&#8217;s plausible to hypothesize some reasons behind its latest move. Strategic staking could be a reason behind the whale&#8217;s $10 million stETH purchase. Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism through ETH 2.0 has opened doors for staking returns. Acquiring stETH, a representation of staked ETH, could be a strategic move by the whale to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity. Another plausible hypothesis could be speculation for price appreciation. It is worth noting that the whale might anticipate a significant price appreciation in the near future and investing a sizable amount can yield substantial returns if the price moves in the favored direction. Related Reading: Ethereum: Is Lido (LDO) Doomed To Repeat Three Arrows Capital’s Fate? Diversification of their portfolio can also be a possible reason behind the whale&#8217;s substantial stETH purchase, especially given the significant amounts of USDC previously deployed by the whale, so moving some of these holdings into stETH may be a calculated strategy to achieve diversification. However, despite the large buys, stETH hasn&#8217;t seen any significant movement. Particularly, the asset has only declined by 0.5% with a current trading price of $1,850.
