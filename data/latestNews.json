    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/starknet-closer-to-full-evm-compatibility-with-kakarot-testnet",
    "description": "<p>Zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution Starknet has moved closer to full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility with the upcoming August launch of Kakarot, a new testnet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kakarot&rsquo;s team has also announced that it has received backing from Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca, Starkware, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.&nbsp;</p>\nGetting Closer To EVM Compatibility&nbsp;\n<p>Kakarot CEO and co-founder Elias Tazartes stated that Starknet while being a leading zero knowledge rollup in the Ethereum ecosystem, lacks Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. As a result, there is a significant barrier to entry. Starknet has gained popularity among developers to help scale decentralized applications, transactions, and computations on Ethereum using its native language, Cairo. According to developers on Starknet, Cairo makes it easier and faster to develop, review, and maintain new code. However, Starknet&rsquo;s lack of Ethereum compatibility could deter some developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The greatest impact that Kakarot can have is to make Starknet EVM compatible. Kakarot right now is like a Solidity or any language engine. Eventually, you will be able to put that engine within Starknet to make it EVM compatible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tazartes revealed that the idea for the zkEVM was first mooted during a Starkware conference held in July 2022. By October, the team was able to get together for a week and begin working on the new zkEVM. By December, coding for the project was complete, and the team was ready to create a fully functional execution layer. Tazartes also revealed that Buterin invested in Kakarot thanks to his enthusiasm for a multiple-zkEVM approach to build out the Ethereum ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For Vitalik, the more zkEVMs, the better, because as long as you have a wide diversity of architecture and diversity of approaches&hellip;then this is really good for the space as a whole.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\nCustom Virtual Machine&nbsp;\n<p>Currently, Starknet runs its own custom smart contract Virtual Machine called the Cairo VM, which is able to leverage Cairo. This means that Starknet does not come with direct EVM compatibility out of the box, which could prove to be a significant hurdle moving forward. According to Tazartes,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Some teams really need to be able to use Solidity. For example, if someone wrote a DEX or an AMM for the Ethereum ecosystem and now has 60,000 lines of code already audited, ready to go, but it&rsquo;s only on EVM chains.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If developers wanted to use Starknet, they would need to hire a new dev team, write and audit the code, and maintain the two code bases. Tazartes described this as &ldquo;prohibitively expensive.&rdquo;</p>\nKakarot zkEVM Secures Backing&nbsp;\n<p>The Kakarot zkEVM team also announced on the 2nd of June that it had closed its pre-seed funding round. Investors in the seed round include Ledger co-founder and VP of innovation Nicolas Bacca, blockchain scaling firm Starkware, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and several others. Kakarot uses STARK proofs for provable transactions and blocks, ensuring security and transparency. Through these validity proofs, Kakarot is able to leverage Ethereum&rsquo;s security while also offering low costs.&nbsp;</p>\nProject Roadmap&nbsp;\n<p>The project roadmap states that in the first phase, Kakarot will be an EVM on the Starknet Layer 2, helping open the door to a range of possibilities, and facilitate the expansion of the Starknet ecosystem. In the subsequent phase, Kakarot and Starknet&rsquo;s Madara sequencer will be combined into a unified stack. This will enable Layer 3 zkEVMs. According to the team, integrating Madara and Kakarot will help the teams deploy zkEVM app chains and settle transactions on Starknet using validity proofs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As a result of computing on another layer, gas costs are (asymptotically) exponentially lower than on L2, and performance (TPS) is higher. The scalability of rollups stacks and multiplies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Visit Wildcoins Casino → Using Litecoin for Online Gambling Litecoin, as an alternative cryptocurrency, offers a unique opportunity for online gambling. It operates on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority, making it a decentralized digital currency. Playing at Litecoin casinos when online gambling involves a process similar to using traditional currencies, but with the added benefits of speed, security, and anonymity that cryptocurrencies offer. To use Litecoin for online gambling, you first need to purchase Litecoin on a cryptocurrency exchange. Once you have Litecoin in your digital wallet, you can deposit it into your online casino account, much like you would with traditional currency. When you&#8217;re ready to cash out your winnings, you can withdraw them back into your Litecoin wallet. What Makes Litecoin Gambling Sites Better? Instant Payments with Litecoin One of the key features of the best Litecoin casino websites is the ability to make instant payments. Traditional banking methods can take days to process transactions, but Litecoin transactions are almost instantaneous. Even when comparing different crypto gambling sites, Litecoin casinos are the better choice. Because LTC has a faster block generation rate than Bitcoin, this allows for quicker transaction confirmation. In the end, this means you can deposit and withdraw funds quickly, allowing you to start playing or cash out your winnings without delay. Secure Online Gambling Sites The best Litecoin casinos offer enhanced security features that make it a safe option for online gambling. It uses a proof-of-work algorithm called Scrypt, which is less resource-intensive than the SHA-256 algorithm used by Bitcoin. This makes it more secure against hardware brute-force attacks. Furthermore, all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, the blockchain, making it nearly impossible to tamper with or forge transactions. Lower Fees Another advantage of playing at Litecoin casinos is the lower transaction fees. Traditional online casinos often charge high fees for deposits and withdrawals. However, because Litecoin casino transactions do not involve banks or other financial institutions, the fees are typically much lower. This makes it a more cost-effective option than real money online gambling. Enhanced Privacy at Litecoin Casinos LTC transactions do not require personal information, which allows you to maintain your privacy when litecoin gambling online. This is a significant advantage for players who prefer to keep their gambling activities private. A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Litecoin at Online Casinos The Process of Buying Litecoin Before you can start gambling at a Litecoin casino, you need to purchase some LTC. This can be done on various cryptocurrency exchanges using traditional currency or other cryptocurrencies. The process is similar to buying stocks or other assets. You will need to create an account on the exchange, deposit funds, and then purchase Litecoin. Recommended Wallets for Storing Cryptocurrencies Once you have purchased Litecoin, you will need a digital wallet to store it. There are several types of wallets available, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline, providing the highest level of security. Software wallets are programs that you install on your computer or smartphone, while online wallets are web-based services that store your cryptocurrency on the cloud. Protect Your Litecoin Investments It&#8217;s important to take steps to protect your crypto funds, this includes using secure wallets, updating your wallet software, and keeping your private keys safe. Private keys are a crucial security feature of cryptocurrencies, as they are required to access your funds. If your private keys are lost or stolen, you will lose access to your funds. Deposit and Withdrawals at Litecoin Casinos Once you have LTC in your wallet, you can deposit it into your online casino account. The process is similar to making a deposit with traditional currency. Go to the deposit section of the casino, select Litecoin as your payment method, and enter the amount you want to deposit. The casino will provide a Litecoin address for you to send your funds to. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds will be available in your casino account. Cash Out Your Winnings in Three Easy Steps Go to the withdrawal section of the casino, select Litecoin as your withdrawal method, and enter the amount you want to withdraw. Provide your Litecoin wallet address for the casino to send your winnings. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds will appear in your Litecoin wallet. Best Casino Games for Litecoin The best Litecoin casino platforms offer a wide range of games, including slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, and more. Some also offer live dealer games, which provide a more immersive gambling experience. The availability of games can vary between casinos, so it&#8217;s important to check what games are available before depositing funds. Here are some of the most popular casino games: Litecoin Slots Slot machines are a staple in any casino. At Litecoin &#38; Bitcoin Slots, players can bet LTC on each spin. The gameplay is straightforward: players spin the reels and hope to land on a winning combination of symbols. The winning conditions vary based on the specific slot machine, but generally, players win when they land certain combinations of symbols on the paylines. Live Dealer Roulette Roulette is a game of chance where players bet on where a ball will land on a spinning wheel. In Litecoin Roulette, players place their bets using Litecoin. The gameplay and winning conditions are the same as traditional roulette, with players winning based on where the ball lands in relation to their bets. Crypto Crash Games Crash gambling casino games are quickly gaining popularity at Litecoin casinos. Players bet a certain amount of LTC and watch as a multiplier increases from 1x upwards. The multiplier can crash at any random time, and the goal is to cash out before it does. If the player cashes out before the multiplier crashes, they win their bet multiplied by the number at which they cashed out. If the multiplier crashes before they cash out, they lose their bet. Dice Dice is a simple yet popular Litecoin casino game. Players bet LTC and predict whether the roll of a dice will result in a number higher or lower than a predetermined number. If the player&#8217;s prediction is correct, they win, with the payout based on the probability of their bet. Moon Moon is a crypto-specific game similar to Crash casino games. Players bet LTC and watch as a spaceship takes off, with the multiplier increasing the further it goes. The spaceship can crash at any time, and the goal is to cash out before it does. The winning conditions are the same as any Crash game. LTC Sports Betting Sports betting with LTC is an exciting, safe, and innovative way to engage with your favorite sports events. The best Litecoin casinos have a sportsbook, allowing users to place bets on a wide range of sports, from football and basketball to horse racing and esports. Just like other crypto sports betting, you can bet on outcomes, scores, player performances, and more. Crypto Bonuses in Litecoin All of the best Litecoin casinos offer promotions to attract and retain players. These can include welcome bonuses, deposit bonuses, free spins, and more. It&#8217;s important to read the terms and conditions of these promotions carefully, as they often have wagering requirements that must be met before you can cash out your winnings. Popular Bonus Types Here are some of the most popular bonuses that players can take advantage of at Litecoin casinos: Welcome Bonus This is the most common type of bonus offered by all the best Litecoin casinos. It is typically offered to new players as a way to encourage them to sign up and start playing. The welcome bonus usually matches a certain percentage of the player&#8217;s initial deposit. For instance, a casino might offer a 100% match bonus up to a certain amount of Litecoin. It&#8217;s also common to receive free spins as part of the welcome bonus package. No Deposit Bonuses This bonus is particularly attractive to new players because it doesn&#8217;t require them to deposit any LTC to claim it. Instead, the online casino gives the player a small amount of funds to start playing with. This allows players to try out casino games without risking their own money. Free Spins Many Litecoin casinos offer free spins as part of their bonus promotions. Usually, the free spins can be used on specific slots and give players the chance to win without having to wager any of their own funds. Reload Bonus This bonus is offered to existing players who make additional deposits. It&#8217;s a way for the litecoin casino to reward loyal players and encourage them to keep playing. Like the welcome bonus, it usually matches a certain percentage of the player&#8217;s deposit. Cashback Some Litecoin casinos offer a cashback bonus, which returns a percentage of the player&#8217;s losses over a certain period. This can help mitigate losses and give players some extra motivation to keep playing. VIP and Loyalty Programs Almost all Litecoin casinos have a VIP or loyalty program that rewards players based on their activity at the casino. These programs often offer a variety of bonuses, including exclusive free spins, higher deposit limits, and even personal account managers. Wagering Requirements and Terms Wagering requirements are the number of times you must bet your bonus money or free spins before you can withdraw winnings. These requirements can vary widely between Litecoin casinos, so it&#8217;s important to read the terms and conditions carefully. Other terms to look out for include game restrictions, time limits, maximum bet limits, and that it isn&#8217;t limited to one crypto like a Bitcoin casino bonus. Safety and Security in Litecoin Casinos While the best Litecoin casinos offer many benefits, it&#8217;s important to ensure that the casino you choose is safe and secure. This includes checking that the casino is licensed and regulated, uses secure encryption technology, and has a good reputation.

They operate similarly to traditional online casinos but offer the added benefits of faster transactions and lower fees associated with cryptocurrencies. What is a Welcome Bonus at LTC Casinos? A Welcome Bonus is a promotional offer provided by many Litecoin Casinos to attract new players. It typically involves deposit bonuses with a certain percentage of bonus funds. The bonus funds can be used to play litecoin casino games on the platform but usually come with wagering requirements that must be met before they can be withdrawn. Can I get Free Spins at Litecoin Casinos? Free spins are common promotional offers at LTC Casinos. The Free spins may be offered as part of a welcome bonus, a standalone promotion, or as a reward within casino games. Any winnings from free spins may be subject to wagering requirements. Can I withdraw my Welcome Bonus in LTC? Yes, you can withdraw your welcome bonus in LTC, but usually, you must first meet the casino&#8217;s wagering requirements. These requirements stipulate that you must wager the bonus amount a certain number of times before it can be withdrawn. Just like online casino real money websites the specific requirements vary by casino, so it&#8217;s important to read the terms and conditions. Are Litecoin Casinos safe to play? The safety of a Litecoin gambling site depends on several factors, including its licensing, regulation, and security measures. The best Litecoin Casino brands are licensed by a recognized gambling authority, use secure encryption technology to protect player data, and offer provably fair games that are regularly audited by independent bodies. Responsible Gambling Litecoin gambling should always be a form of entertainment, never a means of financial gain. This is especially true when it comes to gambling at Litecoin casinos. As a responsible gambler, you must be aware of the risks involved and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Firstly, it&#8217;s important to note that you must be at least 18 years old to participate in any form of gambling, including at a Litecoin casino. This age restriction is in place to protect young individuals from the potential negative impacts of gambling sites. When gambling at LTC casinos, or any other site, it&#8217;s crucial to only play with what you can afford to lose. Cryptos are highly volatile, and their value can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. This can add an extra layer of risk to your gambling activities at online casinos. Here are some essential tips to ensure responsible gambling: Set a Budget: Decide on a specific amount of LTC that you are willing to risk. Once this limit is reached, stop playing. Time Management: Limit the amount of time you spend at the litecoin casino. It can be easy to lose track of time when you&#8217;re engrossed in a game, so setting a timer or alarm can be helpful. Understand the Casino Games: Before you start betting, make sure you fully understand the rules of the game you&#8217;re playing. This includes the odds of winning and the potential payouts. Avoid Chasing Losses: If you find yourself on a losing streak, it can be tempting to keep playing in an attempt to win back what you&#8217;ve lost. However, this can lead to even greater losses. Seek Help if Needed: If you feel that your online gambling habits are becoming problematic, don&#8217;t hesitate to seek help. There are numerous resources available, including counseling services and online support groups. Remember, the goal of gambling should be to have fun. If it&#8217;s causing you stress or financial hardship, it&#8217;s time to step back and reassess. Responsible gambling is important for a safe and enjoyable experience at Litecoin casinos."
