Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were both charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm was arrested and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-arrested-tornado-cash-developer-released-on-bail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >released on bail a few days later</a>, while Semenov was added to the U.S. list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.

The law enforcement actions are a continuation of a U.S. government crackdown on Tornado Cash that began last year due to its alleged role in laundering funds of the Lazarus Group, a North Korean-linked hacking collective. Tornado Cash has been implicated in several other hacks as well. All told, the mixer has laundered over $1 billion in ill-gotten gains, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sam-bankman-fried-is-low-on-meds-living-on-3-peanut-butter-in-prison\"><strong><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried is low on meds, living on $3 peanut butter in prison</strong></strong></h2><p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-jail-meds-peanut-butter-prison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >appears to be having a tough time behind bars</a>, eating only bread with peanut butter to accommodate his vegan diet while exhausting his supply of prescription medication.

    "description": "One of PEPE&#8217;s early adopters is officially out after making over $1.7 million in profit, translating to a 54,725x gain in less than six months. In a tweet shared by Lookonchain on August 26, the meme coin trader bought 1.69 trillion tokens, spending roughly $36, minutes after the project was launched in late April 2023. However, by the time the trader exited, less than six months later, selling off all his tokens, he had realized a decent gain, raking in 1,001 ETH, or roughly $1.7 million at spot rates. PEPE Whale Exits Trackers reveal that the trader first sold 0.69 trillion before fully exiting and liquidating 1 trillion PEPE on August 26, pocketing $885,000 or 537 ETH, pushing his total haul to 1,001 ETH. Considering the pseudonymous nature of Ethereum from where PEPE started trading through Uniswap v3, the trader&#8217;s identity cannot be ascertained. PEPE is one of the more successful meme coin projects in 2023. The token&#8217;s meteoritic rise&#8211;and crash&#8211;over the past couple of months illustrates its volatility. For the project&#8217;s early success and popularity, because of traders buying in and aiming to ride the trend mainly because of fear of missing out (FOMO), PEPE ended up being listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, with support by Binance being the highlight.

The token peaked at $0.0000044839 and have since crashed 81% to $0.0000008674 as of August 26. This price level is an important reaction point marking June 2023 lows and is a primary support level. If bears press on, PEPE may fall to retest $0.0000004984, the opening price when the token began trading when it was listed on Binance on May 1. Meme Coin Trending, Team Transfers Tokens While PEPE is a top-trending token on CoinMarketCap, a tracker owned by Binance, at the time of writing August 26, the whale opted to exit via Uniswap v3. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading multiple tokens, primarily those on Ethereum. It is the second last iteration of the DEX and uses concentrated liquidity. PEPE is also available on Uniswap v2, but most trading is concentrated on Binance and KuCoin, two of the world&#8217;s leading centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

The transfer also coincided with the multisig parameter changes. Only two signatories will be required to effect a transfer, down from five out of eight.
