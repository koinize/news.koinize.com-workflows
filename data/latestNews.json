Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and most altcoins have risen sharply from their 52-week lows, but are still languishing well below their respective all-time highs. This suggests the start of a bullish move, which still has a long way to go.</p><p>One of the most important triggers for the crypto bull market in 2024 is the approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more Bitcoin ETFs get greenlighted in January, then it is bound to boost sentiment and set the stage for the start of a bull move. </p><p>In a bullish environment, market participants do not pay much attention to the negative news, but every positive development is cheered by pushing the price higher. Additionally, the bullish sentiment is likely to spread to altcoins as well. Hence, if Bitcoin rises, several altcoins are likely to march higher.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-spot-etfs-and-a-bull-market-why-eth-sol-okb-and-inj-could-thrive-in-2024\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
