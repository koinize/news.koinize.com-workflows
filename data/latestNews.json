The price soared on Aug. 29 after Grayscale scored a victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the euphoria was short-lived as the price gave back all the recent gains on the news that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-grayscale-gains-wiped-with-sec-spot-etf-delays\">SEC delayed the decision on all seven </a>spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications. </p><p>News related to Bitcoin ETFs has been the major trigger for the markets in the past few days.

According to CoinGlass data, Bitcoin has seen negative returns in September for the past six consecutive years. Will the trend continue in 2023?</p><p>The weakness in Bitcoin is affecting several major altcoins, which have dropped close to their strong support levels. Will the decline extend further or is it time for a bounce to happen? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls failed to defend the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,947) on Aug. 31. That started a sell-off which pulled Bitcoin below the breakout level of $26,833.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/0dd04025-4207-4108-83de-c011170e39df.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The price action of the past few days shows that the BTC/USDT pair has been oscillating inside the large range between $24,800 and $31,000. Typically, traders buy the dips to the support of the range and sell near the resistance. The same is expected from the bulls at $24,800.</p><p>If bears want to seize control, they will have to sink and sustain the price below $24,800. If that happens, the pair may extend the fall to $19,500. There is a minor support at $24,000 but that may not hold for long.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) rebound off the strong support at $1,626 fizzled out at $1,745 on Aug. 29. This indicates that bears remain active at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/57d49a86-36da-4fb8-9c38-f2e485ce3229.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to build upon their advantage by pulling the price below the $1,626 to $1,550 support zone. If they are successful, it will signal the start of a new downtrend. The ETH/USDT pair could then nosedive to the next formidable support at $1,368.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price sharply rebounds off the current level, it will indicate that the bulls are fiercely defending the support. That could drive the price to the 20-day EMA ($1,702) and subsequently to $1,745 which may act as a resistance. </p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) recovery halted at the 50-day SMA ($234) on Aug. 29 and the bears yanked the price below the important support at $220 on Aug. 31.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/ec56eda6-0907-46de-a304-81281578c4ab.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have the upper hand. The bears will try to sink the price to the psychological support at $200. If this level collapses, the BNB/USDT pair could reach the next major support at $183.</p><p>If bulls want to start a relief rally, they will have to push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($222). The pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA and later to the resistance line.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>The long tail on XRP’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) Aug. 31 candlestick shows that the bulls are trying to protect the support at $0.50. However, the price action on Sep. 1 shows that the bears are keeping up the pressure.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/37a49962-072f-46c5-a470-7d8c83e3920c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price plunges below $0.50, it will suggest that bears are back in control. That could start a downward move to the formidable support at $0.41. The bulls are likely to defend this level with vigor. A bounce off the support could keep the XRP/USDT pair range-bound between $0.41 and $0.56 for some more time.</p><p>If the price rebounds off $0.50, it will suggest that the pair may attempt a rally to $0.56. The bulls will have to overcome this roadblock to start a new up-move to $0.63 and thereafter to $0.73. </p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been range-bound between $0.28 and $0.24 for the past several days. The bulls kicked the price above the range on Aug. 29 but could not sustain the higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/fdbeb60a-e2f7-4a52-98c3-73903ea51442.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>That may have tempted the short-term bulls to bail out of their positions. The selling picked up further and the price slipped below the uptrend line on Aug. 31. The bears will next try to sink the ADA/USDT pair below the vital support at $0.24.</p><p>If the price rebounds off $0.24, the pair may continue to consolidate inside the range for a while longer. On the contrary, if the price dips below $0.24, it will signal the start of a down move to $0.22 and eventually to $0.20.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls are struggling to start a recovery in Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>), indicating that demand dries up at higher levels. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/a1ff29c2-05cb-4650-8bd3-19cdc2b3c787.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The DOGE/USDT pair could dip to the solid support at $0.06. Buyers are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break below it may resume the downtrend. The pair could first skid to $0.055 and then to the final support near $0.05.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $0.06, it will signal that the bulls are buying the dips to this level. The bulls will then again try to overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may surge to $0.08.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) returned from the 20-day EMA ($21.37) on Aug. 30, which shows that bears remain in command. The price has reached the vital support at $19.35. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/4ac156d0-f9d9-4556-831e-94eb694ef9fd.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the $19.35 support gives way, the selling could intensify and the SOL/USDT pair may slide to $18.</p><p>Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to start a recovery, they will have to quickly shove the price above the overhead resistance at $22.30. If they do that, the pair may soar toward $26. The 50-day SMA ($23.42) may act as a hurdle but it is likely to be crossed.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rsi-showdown-btc-price-new-2-week-low\"><strong><em>Bitcoin lines up RSI showdown as BTC price slips toward new 2-week low</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) is in a strong uptrend. The bears tried to stall the rally near $1.77 but the bulls did not give up much ground. That shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/1624ce53-a906-415f-9470-07848f2cb37b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ALTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buying resumed on Sep. 1 and the TON/USDT pair has reached the pattern target of $1.91. If buyers scale this level, the up-move may continue and the pair may skyrocket to $2.38. This level may witness profit-booking by the traders.</p><p>This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below $1.66. Such a move will suggest aggressive selling at higher levels. That could then sink the pair to the breakout level of $1.53.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($4.56) on Aug. 30, indicating that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/930a4215-8694-4930-83de-47e27f723244.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOTUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The selling picked up further on Aug. 31 and the DOT/USDT pair dropped to the vital support at $4.22. This level is likely to witness a battle between the bulls and the bears. If the price plummets below $4.22, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend to $4.</p><p>Buyers have their tasks cut out. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly drive and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could surge to the overhead resistance at $5.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) failure to maintain above the 20-day EMA ($0.58) on Aug. 29 may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. The bulls tried to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on Aug. 30 and 31 but the bears held their ground.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/1c964aee-c637-4bf8-b54a-aa1b7a6d78f2.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AMATICUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the immediate support at $0.53. If they can pull it off, the MATIC/USDT pair may slump to the crucial support at $0.51.</p><p>If the price turns up from the current level, it is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA and again at the 50-day SMA ($0.66). On the other hand, a break below $0.51 could resume the downtrend. The next support is at $0.45.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description": "The trend in the total supply of the stablecoins may have hinted in advance that the Bitcoin rally wouldn&#8217;t last too long. Bitcoin Stablecoins Supply Hasn&#8217;t Moved Much Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the latest news has been unable to make the stablecoins supply budge. The &#8220;stablecoins supply&#8221; here refers to the total circulating supply of all stablecoins in the sector. Generally, investors use stables to escape the volatility associated with most coins in the rest of the cryptocurrency sector. Thus, whenever this metric rises, new tokens of the stablecoins are being minted because there is a demand for converting to them from the other assets or fresh demand is coming into the market. Such investors who seek safety in these fiat-tied tokens usually do so because they don&#8217;t want to exit the cryptocurrency sector completely; they only require a temporary place to station their capital. When these holders eventually find that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile coins like Bitcoin, they swap their stablecoins into them, thus putting buying pressure on their prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $26,000 As Miners Sell Big Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoins supply over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has marked a specific correlation between the Bitcoin spot price and the stablecoin supply. It would appear that all the major increases in the former during the past year have come following rises in the latter metric. There are three instances of this trend in this period: the first formed before the January rally, the second before the March rebound, and the third before the June surge. Related Reading: Here’s What Bitcoin Price The Bull Market Will Start According To This Analyst From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the price increase in the asset wasn&#8217;t caused by the increases in the supply of the stables but rather the decline in them that followed afterward. The increases in the supply of the stablecoins likely occurred because of fresh capital injections. When this new capital was deployed into Bitcoin and the others (when the indicator declined), the assets obtained the fuel for their rallies. With the most recent rally in the asset instigated by the news of Grayscale&#8217;s victory against the US SEC, there was no such pattern in the supply of these fiat-tied assets. This may have been one of the early signs that the rally wasn&#8217;t backed by constructive market growth, as the stablecoins supply has only been moving sideways. The Bitcoin retrace below the $26,000 level may have only been a natural consequence of this weak structure. BTC Price Bitcoin had earlier fully retraced the gains of the Grayscale rally, but it would appear that the decline isn&#8217;t over just yet, as the asset has now gone below the $26,000 level it had been at before the surge. BTC has plunged during the past couple of days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"
