Given its finite supply, it’s free from the issues that the US Government is facing right now,” he said. </p><p>Still, Gilbert notes that while <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-crisis-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\">the U.S. banking crisis</a> and the debt-ceiling debacle highlights the inherent utility of an asset like Bitcoin, any investors hoping for current events to provide a massive surge in the value of Bitcoin should tone down their expectations.</p><p>“There’s more fear than optimism in the short term due to the uncertainty of these issues and the liquidity problems they will cause,” Gilbert said. “When the banking crisis happened, it dialed down inflation and rate hike expectations, which is why we saw Bitcoin rally.”</p><p>These sentiments were echoed by Matteo Greco, a research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International, who <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/bitcoin-rises-as-investors-await-vote-on-tentative-debt-ceiling-agreement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">told</a> CNBC that the current downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price is due primarily to investor fears of the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hodlers-exited-capitulation-above-20k-new-metric-hints\"><strong><em>Bitcoin hodlers exited ‘capitulation’ above $20K, new metric hints</em></strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hodlers-exited-capitulation-above-20k-new-metric-hints\"><strong><em></em></strong></a>Typically when central banks raise interest rates, investors choose to take their money out of risky assets like cryptocurrencies and growth stocks.</p><p>“Given Bitcoin was so depressed in 2022, the expectations of this high-interest rate environment changing saw investors take an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at heavy drawdowns. Rate hike expectations have changed significantly so far this year and in the last few weeks,” Gilbert added.</p><p>On Gilbert's assessment, if Fink’s fears of further rate hikes come true, this could see the price of Bitcoin fall further from its current price. If the inverse happens, and the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hiking cycle in June, Gilbert says that investors can expect to see some positive price action for Bitcoin. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/63b1924a-b77b-415c-9c88-e8010a2571a8.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">The price of Bitcoin over the last year.
