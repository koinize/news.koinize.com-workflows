    "description": "BitMex founder Arthur Hayes has revealed that he is diverting his interest toward Ethereum (ETH) while disclosing a bold prediction for the crypto asset. Arthur Hayes Doubling Down On Ethereum Arthur Hayes recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his optimism and prediction about the future of Ethereum, and the post has since caused quite a stir in the entire cryptocurrency community. Renowned for his perceptive market analysis, Hayes claimed to have had a revelation on ETH during one of his meditations, and this prompted him to significantly alter his cryptocurrency holdings. He sarcastically asserted in the X post to have gotten the direction from the Lord.  Related Reading: Ethereum Price Will Skyrocket Due To AI-Driven DAO Revolution: Arthur Hayes Following this supposed heavenly direction, Hayes allegedly sold his Solana holdings and increased his stake in Ethereum. In addition, he has predicted a spike that would take the price of the cryptocurrency asset to an astounding $5,000. He further conveyed his love and appreciation for Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Hayes called Vitalik an Archangel while doing so. Hayes&#8217; evaluation of the market dynamics might have played a role in his choice to divert from Solana to Ethereum. In another X post, Arthur Hayes shared a chart of Ethereum to back up his predictions. The crypto exchange founder has urged the crypto community to &#8220;get down&#8221; on the digital asset. The BitMex founder&#8217;s projections come after his previous call, in which he predicted that Solana&#8217;s price would hit $100. Hayes&#8217; prediction has appeared to be almost accurate, as the digital asset&#8217;s price has recently reached a peak of $99. Since mid-December SOL has been demonstrating a rally, increasing by an astounding 350%. Despite the fact that Solana is displaying an upward trajectory, Hayes seems to think that Ethereum still has the potential to outperform SOL. Glassnode Co-Founders Give Next Target For The Crypto Asset Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, cofounders of Glassnode and collectively known on X as Negentropic, have highlighted the next target for Ethereum. According to the cofounders, the next target for ETH is $2,500 and has urged the community to keep an eye on this level. Related Reading: Is Ethereum (ETH) Ready For A Monster Move In January 2024? Negentropic asserted that the asset reaching the $2,500 target will be triggered by market enthusiasm. Another target identified by the founders is $2,700, which ETH will attain by continuous ambitious push. The co-founders also highlighted a support level at $2,100, which was once a resistance level but now a key zone. However, Negentropic pointed out that the level has now turned out to be critical for short-term rebounds. In addition, they asserted that if ETH ends up breaching the support level, it might activate the 50-Day EMA. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,307, indicating a 1.30% increase in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased by 19% to $16,690,793,321, its market capitalization has increased by 1.31% to $277,454,559,883. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "Wyckoff Analysis (WA) aims to understand why prices of stocks and other market items move due to supply and demand dynamics. It typically is applied to any freely traded market where larger or institutional traders operate (commodities, bonds, currencies, etc.). In this article we will apply WA to the cryptocurrency Cosmos ($ATOM) to make a forecast for approximate future events. Cosmos Price Data from MEXC Futures &#124; Source: ATOMUSDT.P on tradingview.com. Link to the raw image: https://www.tradingview.com/x/r8asKWOI Cosmos $ATOM is currently in Phase D of a Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic #1. Note the volume spike near where I placed the SC and Spring. In Wyckoff Analysis these typically must align even if the overall form isn&#8217;t perfect. The only slight anomaly is that the ST dips sharply below the SC breaking the ICE (not labeled). There are Advanced Schematics that you can find online that accommodate many of these anomalous formations. Phase D is where demand greatly overcomes supply leading the rallies on higher (or noticeably increasing) volume. When an LPS occurs that is typically a favorable (even optimal) place for a long position. It recently finished a Reaccumulation, to which it&#8217;s rallying sharply. Below are the typical schematics for both Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic #1 and a Reaccumulation for reference.

In this case it&#8217;s at $18, but $15 is a preliminary target it must concretely clear first. Doing some more work using the Horizontal Count method with PnF charts yields different results. My settings are currently a $0.25 box size and a three box reversal on a High-Low lookback. When using the Horizontal Count method Extended Congestions need to be accounted for differently. The main thing is finding the relevant column in and out to create the Congestion Box. In our case that&#8217;s from 13 to 20 December 2023 spanning 7 bars. Since this is a Reaccumulation &#8220;breakout&#8221; we will need to add the value from the formula the Horizontal Count uses. 7 x $0.25 x 3 = $5.25 The relevant low to add this to is $10.25 so the PnF target is $15.5.
