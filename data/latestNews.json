Moon Lambo said XRP has grown by 85% this year, implying a positive overall trend.</p><p>Several weeks have passed since Judge Analisa Torres delivered the highly anticipated ruling that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">XRP is not considered a security</a> in certain circumstances. This decision caused a significant surge in the price of the cryptocurrency within the broader <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future\">Web3</a> ecosystem.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It’s all about expectations. Unless we were in a full bull market - led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> - I never believed XRP would hit an ATH, even after a good ruling and I said that when asked about my expectations on price (although I did expect it to break $1 tbh).

While he didn’t anticipate XRP reaching a new all-time high after the ruling, he did expect the price to surpass the $1 resistance level.</p><p>However, neither of these scenarios unfolded despite the token experiencing a significant surge of over 70% following the ruling to hit $0.84.</p><p>XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 over six years ago. While surpassing that price level may be overly ambitious, Deaton remains optimistic that getting $1 is possible.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-ripple-ceo-slams-sec-over-use-of-xrp-report-in-lawsuit\"><strong><em>Ripple CEO slams SEC over the use of XRP report in lawsuit</em></strong></a></p><p>However, the lawyer said it is linked to the price of Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>).
