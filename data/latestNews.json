In a March 11 letter, Democrat senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler claimed that allowing any further approvals of crypto ETFs would see investors exposed to thinly traded markets rife with fraud and manipulation. The senators also urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to take several specific steps with the already launched Bitcoin ETF products, requesting that BTC ETF brokers and advisers be subjected to further regulatory scrutiny.

Closing arguments began in London on March 12 in the lawsuit brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) lawsuit against Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claimed to be Nakamoto since 2016. Wright has been accused of massive document forgery for supporting his claim of being the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder. COPA was seeking injunctive relief to prevent Wright from further claiming to be Nakamoto.</p><p>Prosecutors <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/united-states-prosecutors-lewis-kaplan-ftx-sam-bankman-fried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">are asking for a sentence of 40-50 years</a> for the former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.
