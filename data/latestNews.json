But after his money dried up one summer, he scored a six-week gig as a professional game tester  and he’s never looked back.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690009192.jpeg\" alt=\"Mighty Bear Games' Simon Davis' guitar collection\" class=\"wp-image-22374\" width=\"261\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690009192.jpeg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690009192-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Davis ever-growing guitar collection. (Simon Davis)</em> </figcaption></figure><p>During his time in the gaming industry, Davis has held management and product lead positions at gaming companies including King Digital Entertainment, Ubisoft, Bigpoint, AKQA, Empire Interactive, and Laughing Jackal. </p><p>In 2017, Davis teamed up with some friends and fellow industry veterans to launch Mighty Bear Games in Singapore, where they intended to focus on creating traditional games  before pivoting to blockchain in 2022. And in 2023, the firm launched an open beta for Mighty Action Heroes, its first Web3 gaming title.</p><p>Davis, who also goes by “Papa Bear,” said every Mighty Bear employee receives a “bear title.” Some of Papa Bear’s employees include “Arty Bear,” “Bear-Abel,” “Excel Bear,” and “Bear McNumbers.”</p><h3 id=\"h-why-the-pivot-to-blockchain-gaming\">Why the pivot to blockchain gaming?</h3><p>I was lucky enough to kind of get into Bitcoin by accident in 2015, so Ive been in the space for a few years. In 2021, I started playing with NFTs, and Im lucky enough to be also based in Southeast Asia, so I could see firsthand what was happening with Axie [Infinity]. I think, for me, as someone who lived through the transition to free-to-play, it felt very much like a moment, kind of like when Farmville came out on Facebook. </p><p>I think that for live service titles [games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Apex Legends], a dominant business model is going to emerge to revolve around player-owned and operated economies. Because I dont believe you can have virtual worlds without digital property rights, essentially.</p><p>And I think that does enable a lot of new things that were really starting to scratch the surface on. So, I think that really was the pull factor.</p><h3 id=\"h-what-format-do-you-think-serves-as-the-best-way-to-attract-users-to-blockchain-gaming\">What format do you think serves as the best way to attract users to blockchain gaming?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690008256-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"The Mighty Bear Games team\" class=\"wp-image-22378\" width=\"379\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690008256-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690008256-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690008256-770x578.jpeg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo1690008256.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Mighty Bear Games team. (Simon Davis)</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think mobile gaming is going to be the dominant platform because of geography. You see this if you look at the charts for the countries that have a great slope of interest in crypto or Web3. They tend to be countries where existing payment rails are not super developed.</p><p>People are largely unbanked in places like Indonesia and Brazil. These markets are mobile-first. Like, people in the Philippines and India are not necessarily using high-end PCs. </p><p>So, you need to go where the users are. And this is a bit of a spicy take, but this is why Im very bearish on people making super HD high-end Web3 games because its just not where the markets are today. So, you see a lot of these teams raising, like, mega bucks to make console-quality titles, but if no one can play them, then they arent going to do very much.</p><h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-think-the-current-hurdles-are-for-large-scale-blockchain-gaming-adoption\">What do you think the current hurdles are for large-scale blockchain gaming adoption?</h3><p>A lot of people talk about it in terms of silver bullets, right? Like, Oh, we need one good game, or like, We need to solve the wallet problem. I dont think its any one of those things. I actually think it is just a lot of lead bullets, a lot of small things that need to happen. </p><p>What Ive experienced today is still pretty terrible, and scary, like social recovery. And its starting to become a thing, but that needs to become a lot easier.<br><br><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/toxic-twitter-tribalism-crypto-toxygen/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Toxic Twitter Tribalism: The Fuel Powering the Crypto Rocket?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/collectivism-collaboration-crypto-art-world/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Art Week</span>                            <p>Connecting the Dots: Collectivism and Collaboration in the Crypto Art World</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div> </p><p>I just think, in general, it needs to be as easy and as brainless to use as a Web2 experience. And so I think there is an inherent conflict today with how people think about Web3, you know. They say things like, Oh, you need to educate the users, or, Train people to hold their private keys.</p><p>But you know, my mom doesnt want to hold her own private keys. She does all her trading on Crypto.com. We need to make it essentially idiot-proof so anyone can do it.</p><p>I think were still quite a long way away, but I am seeing meaningful improvements, actually. Im seeing products that are going to go to market next year which are going to help a lot. </p><p>I dont know how old you are, but Ive just turned 40 this year. I remember in the 90s setting up a home internet connection on dial-up. It took me two days of calling technical support and someone telling me like configs. I was having to go in and change manually and stuff. And now, you know, we solved that, right? And then, the internet became a mass market, and then people could just put a CD in their computer, and it just worked. I think we need to get to that stage.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/-2023-07-24-121116-1024x760.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-22382\" width=\"-805\" height=\"-596\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/-2023-07-24-121116-1024x760.png 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/-2023-07-24-121116-300x223.png 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/-2023-07-24-121116-770x572.png 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/-2023-07-24-121116.png 1111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Mighty Action Heroes. (Game website)</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"h-do-you-think-the-bad-rap-blockchain-nft-gaming-gets-is-a-big-issue\"><strong>Do you think the bad rap blockchain/NFT gaming gets is a big issue? </strong></h3><p>Its funny because gaming got a pretty bad rap in the 90s. You know, everyone was talking about how games were making children violent. There was a big moral panic, just like there was in music a few years before.</p><p>But I think that when you start to get these things in peoples hands and experience them, perceptions change. I do think a lot of the reputation that we have in crypto and Web3 is deserved. There are a lot of bad actors exploiting the lack of regulation, but the things that excite me: Ive seen some games, for example, that allow players to earn small amounts of Bitcoin, And this sort of things retention numbers are very strong, like the initial metrics are very promising. And I think thats a really nice use case.</p><p>Reddit is also a great example, right? They put NFTs in the hands of huge numbers of people. A lot of people didnt even realize they were interacting with NFTs. So then they had their first taste, and yeah  there are some stats that have come up, and not a huge amount of them have transacted on-chain.</p><p>But I actually dont think thats such a bad thing. If people are not dumping the assets on day one, I dont see that as a negative. So, I think onboarding through stealth is pretty good.</p><h3 id=\"h-what-kind-of-adoption-metrics-are-you-looking-for-with-your-games\"><strong>What kind of adoption metrics are you looking for with your games?</strong></h3><p>So, people talk about installs and sign-ups  its just a vanity metric. For me, Im interested in how many people are coming in every day, how regularly theyre coming back, and what the growth curve of that looks like initially.</p><p>And then once we do the mobile launch [of Mighty Action Heroes], which will be around August/September, how well are we doing on attracting non-crypto-native people into the game as well? That will be very interesting, and to see how they play together. Its a different angle, but its one that Im pretty bullish on.</p><h3 id=\"h-what-are-some-ideas-or-tech-upgrades-that-could-help-blockchain-gaming\">What are some ideas or tech upgrades that could help blockchain gaming?</h3><p>ERC-6551 tokens. </p><p>Essentially, they give a smart contract account or a smart contract wallet to a 721 [token]. So, you know, a traditional NFT would be a JPG with some metadata attached. But essentially, the JPG or the asset, whatever that is, is then bound to a smart contract. </p><p>And this is pretty cool because it means that assets can communicate directly with each other. So NFT to NFT, without using MetaMask. And it could also be compatible with other smart contract wallets. </p><p>I think the really cool thing is that, essentially, your asset becomes a wallet and can have its own logic as well. So you could have a base character in a game as the 6551 token, and then all the clothes or the items or everything that that character has, the kind of sub-assets, can change within, each with its own logic.</p><p>As a game developer, you start thinking of how your characters could evolve and how you can attach new assets without updating the core.</p><p>Then as a dev, I think its really good for reputation management as well. Like, if you did a soulbound version, you could have achievements, proof-of-work, proof-of-play, social identity. I think its pretty cool. […] Its more secure because its not just an asset within a wallet like it is on smart contracts with its own private key.<br><br><div class=\"subscribe subscribe--inner\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"subscribe__inner\"><div class=\"subscribe__content\">    <div class=\"subscribe__title display2\">Subscribe</div>    <div class=\"subscribe__desc text-l\">The most engaging reads in blockchain.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/sequoia-capital-slashes-crypto-fund/",
    "description": "Just over a year after launching its crypto fund, venture capital firm Sequoia is now rolling back its investments and taking more of a more careful approach. The firm was making some serious waves when it launched its crypto fund last year in February, signaling that crypto was ready for mainstream VC backing. But now the company has reportedly downsized its cryptocurrency fund by 65% as the crypto winter rages on.  Sequoia Pulls Back On Its Crypto Funding Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prestigious VC firms, is scaling back its ambitions in the crypto space. After launching a dedicated $585 million crypto fund last year, Sequoia recently announced they’re slashing it by 65% to $200 million.  Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike The firm has also reduced its ecosystem fund by 50%. The fund, which invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors, is now at $450 million, down from $900 million. Insiders close to the situation said this is a result of the bear market, which has affected projects across the industry and pulled down prices significantly over the last year. Why Is Sequoia Taking This Step Now? Sequoia is known for making investments in crypto companies and had initially announced its funds as part of a larger restructuring effort to increase its investments in the crypto space. The crypto market, however, has seen most projects take a big hit over the last few months and Sequoia wasn&#8217;t left out, as it has seen a major part of its investment take drastic losses.  The company was particularly affected by the crash of FTX, as it had a $214 million investment in the failed crypto exchange. Rather than spray and pray with a large fund, Sequoia is now tightening its focus.  Total market cap at $1.14 trillion as VC investments slow down &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com According to the report, the company&#8217;s new investment plan is to pivot toward smaller crypto players. The smaller cryptocurrency fund will now focus more on a select group of startup companies.  With the crypto market taking a major downturn since the announcement of its funds, it&#8217;s no surprise that Sequoia has decided to scale back. Crypto projects, in particular, haven&#8217;t done well in recent times.

More data published by Cointelegraph also shows that the amount of money invested in cryptocurrency startups through venture capital fell by 29.73% in the month of June. While it shows a lack of faith and reflects the growing trend among venture capital firms, the pullback doesn&#8217;t mean Sequoia is abandoning the space altogether. The venture capital firm began its crypto journey in 2014 and has a history of backing innovative technologies early on. Featured image from CryptoPotato, chart from Tradingview.com"
