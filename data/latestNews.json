It was first unveiled by Tomy in 1983 as a plastic model figure. Other franchises to be migrated include Hello Kitty Aggretsuko and Bubble Bobble.</p><p>\"Act Games excels at expanding iconic IPs, transcending demographics, and enhancing player engagement. This alliance will allow us to combine our web3 learnings and expertise with nostalgic IP backed by a pre-existing core fanbase,\" said Trung Nguyen, CEO and Co-founder of Sky Mavis, regarding the development. Initial incentives include Zoids NFTs and a token drop for users who migrate to a Ronin wallet to play the game. Since 2019, Act Games has developed four arcade-style games with net sales of $6.4 million and 3 million downloads.</p><p>Since inception, Sky Mavis' Axie Infinity has $4.2 billion in NFT sales volume, millions of daily active users during its peak, and $1.3 billion in revenue.
