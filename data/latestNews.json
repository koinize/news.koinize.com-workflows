    "description": "<p>Avalanche Foundation has earmarked a whopping $50M to acquire assets that are tokenised on its blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\nReshaping the financial landscape\n<p>In a blog on the Avalanche website, the ambitious venture, named \"Avalanche Vista,\" is explained. By converting real-world assets into digital tokens on the blockchain, Avalanche aims to revolutionise the way assets are viewed and handled, making the process faster, more scalable, and tailored to specific needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This significant financial commitment underscores the foundation's vision of reshaping the financial landscape. By leveraging Avalanche's cutting-edge consensus mechanism, innovative Subnet structure, and technological prowess, the foundation seeks to propel the concept of tokenization into the mainstream. The goal? To showcase how blockchain can transform traditionally cumbersome processes like asset issuance, settlement, and management.&nbsp;</p>\nA new era of tokenisation\n<p>John Wu, Ava Labs' President, remarked:</p>\n\n<p>\"Asset tokenization isn&rsquo;t just the future of capital markets, it&rsquo;s a critical driver of the present,&rdquo; said John Wu, President of Ava Labs. &ldquo;The groundswell of momentum across institutions building on-chain has been astounding, and the Avalanche Foundation is taking a big leap forward with this initiative.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Historically, private market investments have been a playground for the elite. But the barriers that kept many at bay, such as high operational costs and manual processes, are being dismantled. By merging on-chain asset management with tokenization, we're ushering in a new era of efficiency and enhanced user experience.</p>\nA $20 trillion market by 2030\n<p>Reports suggest a bright future for tokenised assets. Security Token Advisors found that a staggering 77% of capital market players foresee the digitization of traditional securities in the next decade. By 2030, the market for tokenised securities could skyrocket to $20T. Moreover, VanEck anticipates institutions will tokenise assets worth $25B in 2023. </p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
