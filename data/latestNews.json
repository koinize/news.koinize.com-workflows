The tool also features capabilities allowing merchants to receive payments in underserved regions with limited internet connectivity.</p><p>Additionally, the solution provides reconciliation through consolidated merchant reports with itemized e-CNY transactions available via DBS' digital platform for business banking.</p><p>According to DBS Bank China CEO Ginger Cheng, the company has completed the first e-CNY transaction involving a catering company in Shenzhen. He said:</p><blockquote>“By seamlessly integrating a CBDC collection and settlement method into our clients’ existing payment systems, this will help position their business for a digital future where consumers in China use e-CNY for their daily activities.\"</blockquote><p>He added that the development showcases the firm’s commitment to improving user experience while “actively supporting the development of China’s financial market innovation.”</p><p>Lim Soon Chong, DBS Bank head of global transaction services, noted that the new CBDC service marks another milestone in the firm’s efforts of enabling instant and frictionless 24/7 payments. “We look forward to building on this launch to explore new digital payment solutions, such as cross-border CBDC payments,” the exec added.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-legal-tender-in-chinese-city-jinan-for-bus-rides\"><strong><em>Chinese city of Jinan accepts CBDC payments for bus rides</em></strong></a></p><p>Since <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-central-bank-to-lead-real-world-pilot-of-digital-yuan-report\">launching the CBDC</a> in 2019, China has significantly progressed in promoting and expanding the digital yuan.

The CBDC is currently accepted across 26 cities and 17 provinces in China, with adoption expected to scale further as the program gradually expands to more regions.</p><p>While supporting centralized finance initiatives like e-CNY, DBS Bank is known for its pro-crypto stance. In 2020, the Singaporean megabank <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/singapore-s-largest-commercial-bank-reportedly-launching-crypto-trading\">launched cryptocurrency trading</a> and custody services for institutional clients.

It cites several public announcements by the RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das. </p><p>During his June speech in London, Das emphasized the importance of foreign trade infrastructure for the “digital rupee”, which was set to reach 1 million users domestically by the beginning of July: </p><blockquote>“But cross-border payments will also become much quicker, more seamless and very cost-effective. That is another area where a lot of attention needs to be given. We are constantly in dialogue with other central banks that have introduced or are introducing CBDCs.”</blockquote><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rbi-lists-risks-of-stablecoin-for-developing-economies-calls-for-global-regulation\"><strong><em>RBI lists risks of stablecoins for developing economies, calls for global regulation</em></strong></a></p><p>According to the report, banks from 18 countries have already opened rupee vostro accounts since July 2022. In his other public appearance, Das explained India’s eagerness to provide its CBDC as a payment method for importing Indian goods for countries, struggling with the U.S. dollar supply: </p><blockquote>“In India, we have no shortage of dollars, but in some other markets, due to a shortage of dollars, they are unable to do imports.” </blockquote><p>Another reason for betting hard on the digital rupee for foreign trade deals is the intent to save up the dollar reserves of the country:</p><blockquote>“In the ‘taper tantrum’ period, suddenly, India had an external sector crisis, and the RBI had to attract foreign inflows by offering some incentives. We did not want to have a repeat of that situation.” </blockquote><p>The RBI launched its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/reserve-bank-of-india-to-reportedly-launch-digital-rupee-pilot-in-november\">wholesale digital rupee</a> pilot project in Nov. 2022 and a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-in-no-hurry-for-cbdc-as-digital-rupee-pilot-onboards-50k-users\">retail digital rupee pilot project</a> in Feb. 2023.
