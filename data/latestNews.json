As a result, Nuvelstijn is not concerned that exchanges like his would run out of BTC to meet trading demands:</p><blockquote>“As a platform we’re agnostic to that. We are just matching buy and sell orders to make trades possible. If there’s a lot of demand for Bitcoin, it’s only a good thing for the sector.”</blockquote><p>Nuvelstijn also weighed in on the influence of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications submitted in the United States over the past year and the potential influence their approval could have on the value of Bitcoin:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen more attention, more interest in the crypto market. You saw how steeply the Bitcoin price increased over the past two weeks. It was up 20 or 30 percent which is a massive jump.”</blockquote><p>Bitvavo has seen an increase in web traffic as well as customers visiting their platform and using their app. The exchange has onboarded new customers as well, while Nuvelstijn added that these numbers were still short of the levels it saw in 2021:</p><blockquote>“As you mentioned, the ETFs are not yet approved, right? So this is let's say a pre-event. The event itself still needs to happen.”</blockquote><p>Nuvelstijn also explained that while Bitvavo’s core markets remain the Netherland and Belgium, it is eyeing steady expansion into jurisdictions including France, Spain and Italy. He also believes that the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) will drive market maturity and ease of doing business:</p><blockquote>“It will open up the European market so you no longer need a license per country. The regulation will become more harmonized, meaning you can easily do cross-border business.”</blockquote><p>Nuvelstijn also sees MiCA laying the foundation for cryptocurrency companies to offer more financial services, drawing comparisons to conventional financial regulations:</p><blockquote>“It will be easier for crypto companies to offer financial services and for financial services to offer crypto services. I think you will see those kinds of business models being more commingled.”</blockquote><p>A report from a Standard Chartered analyst in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supply-shock-btc-price-120k-standard-chartered\">July 2023</a> suggests that growing institutional demand for Bitcoin could drive the price of BTC to around $120,000 by the end of the year, driven by increased mining profitability which will ease the need to sell mined coins.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/cuba-bitcoin-revolution-adoption-embargo/\"><strong><em>Magazine: The Truth Behind Cuba’s Bitcoin Revolution: An on-the-ground report</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a modest upturn in both its daily and weekly performance, prompting speculation about its potential for future growth. While the gains have been minimal, a prominent analyst, Ali Martinez, suggests that there might be room for further development.  Martinez&#8217;s analysis reveals that Dogecoin, as seen on the weekly chart, is breaking free from a multiyear descending triangle pattern. This pattern is a technical analysis pattern used in financial markets to predict potential price movements. In this pattern, a horizontal line represents a level of support, while a descending trendline signifies a level of resistance.  #Dogecoin shows promising signs, breaking out from a multi-year descending triangle on the $DOGE weekly chart! The confirmation of a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator within this timeframe reinforces #DOGE bullish outlook. pic.twitter.com/ao7VXyxaEa — Ali (@ali_charts) October 29, 2023 DOGE: Resilience Amid Market Volatility The price typically bounces between these two lines, creating a triangle shape. Breakouts from this pattern often indicate a significant price movement. In the case of Dogecoin, breaking out from this pattern suggests a potential upward price movement. Current data from CoinGecko places Dogecoin&#8217;s price at $0.069051, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past 24 hours and a 2.0% rise over the previous seven days. Martinez has specifically noted that the meme coin is displaying a confirmation of a buy signal generated by the TD Sequential indicator within this timeframe. DOGE seven-day price action.

Bullish Dogecoin Indicators The TD Sequential indicator is a technical analysis tool that helps traders identify potential points of trend exhaustion or trend continuation. A buy signal in this context indicates that the current price movement is expected to continue upward, which aligns with Martinez&#8217;s optimism regarding Dogecoin&#8217;s future prospects. In a surprising turn of events, a Dogecoin wallet that had remained dormant for nearly a decade came back to life recently. This wallet was involved in a series of significant transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The blockchain tracking platform Blockchair first detected this sudden activity. Blockchair&#8217;s data showed that the inactive wallet executed three separate transfers on October 28 and October 29. These transactions involved the movement of DOGE tokens amounting to $372,461 to a different wallet. The sheer scale of this movement has raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community. The reactivation of a long-dormant wallet and the substantial transfers it conducted have stirred speculation within the Dogecoin community. Such significant transactions have the potential to influence market sentiment and, subsequently, price movements. Traders and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring the market to assess the impact of this whale move on Dogecoin&#8217;s price.
