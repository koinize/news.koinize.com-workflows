    "description": "In the last Bitcoin news, the price of the first cryptocurrency by market cap has been experiencing some gains on low timeframes. However, traders on the crypto exchange Binance were surprised when the BTC price suddenly dropped. Related Reading: CRV Spikes 22% In 2 Weeks As Whale Withdraws From Binance As of the writing of this Bitcoin news, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price trades above $27,000 for the first time in weeks. BTC recorded a 2% profit in the last 24 hours and seven days, while the price of Ethereum leads the incipient bullish momentum. Shocking Bitcoin News For Traders On Binance According to crypto report Colin Wu, the price of Bitcoin crashed on the trading venue from its current levels to as low as $2,700. As seen on the chart below, and unlike previous occasions, the crash took place on different occasions. The incident was recorded at 16:17 UTC+8 time on the crypto exchange’s perpetual futures platform. One of the most popular trading instruments on the crypto exchange, its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, responded to the incident. Via his personal X account, CZ said: Root cause identified, some new code caused it. Need to revert and fix data. Engineers say 1hr ETA for fix. So, expect 2hr or so. In a previous tweet, CZ clarified that a problem with the display for the trading pair caused the issue. The User Interface was unaffected, like the APIs connected to the platform. Thus, fortunately for traders on the platform, the incident failed to trigger any stop losses or margin calls for the BTC/USDT futures positions. This is a display ONLY issue. Trading not affected. https://t.co/ZixcFVcxQU — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) September 29, 2023  BTC Price Analysis On the other hand, despite this Bitcoin news, the BTC price seems to be stabilizing around $27,000 and could potentially flip this level as support, allowing for a bullish continuation. A pseudonym crypto analyst claims that the cryptocurrency remains below the 20-day moving average and 21-day exponential moving average. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Insights From Leading Analysts If the cryptocurrency can reclaim this territory, then bulls could have a shot of returning above $30,000. Looking at potential clues that could hint at further profits, the analyst said: Bitcoin Open Interest came down a lot as price held steady. I said it yesterday but I&#8217;ll say it again, it&#8217;s looking a lot healthier than any prior dumps. This does not mean this can&#8217;t go down obviously. It does make it less likely to see these volatile up and down moves. Cover image from Unsplash, charts from DaanCrypto on X and Tradingview"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/major-shiba-inu-news-coming-kusama-end-silence/",
    "description": "In a whirlwind of anticipation, the Shiba Inu community is holding its collective breath as Shytoshi Kusama, the chief architect behind SHIB, hints at breaking his silence. With a slew of developments on the horizon for the Shiba Inu project, the statement amplifies expectations for potential significant updates. In a message conveyed by team member Lucie on Twitter, Kusama emphasized his unwavering support for the Shiba Inu community, stating, &#8220;We FULLY intend to support the community. Hence the paper. Takes time, that&#8217;s all. But I think it&#8217;s time for my silence to end SOON.&#8221; This announcement has fueled heightened expectations and excitement for what&#8217;s next for the Shiba Inu project. Potential Shiba Inu News The Shiba Inu project has been the subject of much discussion recently, especially with recent alterations and announcements. A few days ago, there was a notable transformation of BONE, Shibarium&#8217;s gas token. The process, termed &#8220;renouncing,&#8221; ensures that BONE has now become fully decentralized, thereby eliminating any chance for future alterations or manipulations by the contract owner. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery Kaal Dhairya, a prominent developer within the Shiba Inu community, took to X (previously known as Twitter) to affirm this significant shift. He remarked, &#8220;The deed is done, BONE is now renounced via the TopDog contract. We will continue to build decentralized, permissionless systems for the benefit of the community.&#8221; Furthermore, on the dawn of September, Lucie, who holds the mantle of Shiba Inu’s Marketing Officer, pulled back the curtains on the unveiling of Wrapped BONE. WBONE has been introduced as a Shibarium-based token. It offers a standardized representation of the BONE token, ensuring its compatibility with the diverse ecosystem of smart contracts and DApps on the Shibarium network. So, what developments can be anticipated next? Speculation runs rife on the next potential move for Shiba Inu. ShibaSwap&#8217;s transition to Shibarium has been a hot topic since Kusama&#8217;s last update in August, where he hinted at the move happening &#8220;soon&#8221;. However, an echoing silence has surrounded ShibaSwap&#8217;s migration progress since then. However, the Shibarium project is more than just ShibaSwap and there&#8217;s a broader vision. The SHIB team has pledged to transition all Shiba Inu-linked ventures to the state-of-the-art Shibarium platform. This migration includes captivating offerings like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, eyes are keenly set on &#8220;Shib: The Metaverse&#8221; &#8211; a metaverse product that has been in the wings for some time without any fresh updates as of lately. SHIB Price Poised For Massive Rally? In recent days, the Shiba Inu price has shown a slight uptrend. However, the 4-hour chart shows that the bulls need to show much more buying power to break out of the sideways trend of the last three-plus weeks. Today, the SHIB price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00000742. Related Reading: Shiba Inu At $0.0000072: Sellers Push For Breakout From Compact Zone In order to build more bullish momentum in the smaller time frames, it is essential for SHIB to break through this resistance. As of now, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000753 and the September 23 local high at $0.00000770 are key price targets. If SHIB can build bullish momentum on the smaller time frames, this could also suggest that SHIB bulls are winning the battle on the higher time frames where a bullish quadruple bottom or a descending triangle is looming (1-week chart). As explained in previous analyses, both patterns are still too similar to make a final judgment at the moment. If the quadruple bottom bottom—a noteworthy pattern in technical analysis—is validated, SHIB could be poised for a substantial rally. Market participants would be wise to observe the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level closely, situated at $0.00002545, which could signify an approximate surge of 250% from its current standing. However, the bullish scenario depicted by the quadruple bottom is juxtaposed by the contrasting bearish implications of the descending triangle. A breach below the support level of $0.00000715 could corroborate the descending triangle pattern, likely thrusting SHIB toward a low of $0.000006 for the year. Such a breach may lead SHIB into unknown territory, with the prospect of establishing a new all-time low becoming a stark possibility. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
