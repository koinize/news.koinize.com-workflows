The lawyers noted:</p><blockquote>“The burden imposed by these depositions far outweighs their potential benefit, and the discovery sought is disproportionate to the needs contemplated by the consent order.”</blockquote><p>The attorneys also argued that the SEC still has “no evidence to support its unsubstantiated allegations” implying that customer assets have been somehow diverted.
