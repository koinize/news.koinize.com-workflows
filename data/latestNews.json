The team has built a marketplace featuring Ordinals smart contracts auctions on the ICP, a complete cross-chain wallet between Bitcoin and the ICP, as well as an inscription tool. </p><blockquote>“It had only been two weeks after Casey Rodarmor released Ord 0.4.0, and I knew Ordinals were going to be absolutely massive.”</blockquote><p>The Bioniq team highlighted the growth in the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens since their inception in Jan. 2023. The market cap now exceeds $3 billion, with over 42.6 million Ordinals minted to date. This has directly affected Bitcoin network congestion, leading to a spike in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) transaction fees last seen since 2021.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/db8bad5c-75a5-42dc-898d-0a6134dcad95.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin transaction fees showed significant spikes in 2023 following the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Source: Blockchain.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bioniq’s platform features a smart wallet for users to manage private keys using Web3Auth. This allows users to log into the platform using conventional Web2 Google accounts while maintaining noncustodial control of their wallets and assets.</p><p>The platform also uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) through the ICP’s Bitcoin network integration. This unlocks smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin, removing the need for users to use centralized cross-chain bridges.</p><h2>ICP is a “fantastic Bitcoin sidechain”</h2><p>Building on ICP also allows Bioniq to claim transaction finality times below two seconds, as well as zero gas or network fees. Its architecture provides optimized storage costs, averaging around $5 per gigabyte of data stored annually.</p><p>Bodily added that Toniq, the studio behind Bioniq, has been developing on the ICP since May 2021 and has extensive experience building smart contract wallets, marketplaces, NFT launchpads and collateralized NFT lending protocols:</p><blockquote>“ICP is a fantastic Bitcoin sidechain right now because it has wonderful Bitcoin primitives at the protocol layer.”</blockquote><p>Bodily explains that ICP operates a Bitcoin light node running fully on-chain, which facilitates reading the Bitcoin blockchain via native smart contract calls. The ICP also has a threshold digital signature algorithm, <a href=\"https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/what-is-ecdsa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">known</a> as an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The implementation allows ICP smart contracts to sign layer-1 Bitcoin transactions and broadcast them to the mempool.</p><p>“These protocol primitives also enabled us to build an Ordinals wrapper entirely at the application layer; we didn’t have to touch the consensus layer of the protocol at all. So it is very fast to build Bitcoin tech on ICP right now,” Bodily added.</p><h3>Bitcoin users and trust assumptions</h3><p>Cointelegraph also inquired whether Bioniq’s wrapping process could be a potential barrier to entry for users. Bodily admits that while the process is largely automated by the Bioniq wallet and only requires BTC, there are two considerations that are pertinent for more discerning users.</p><p>“Wrapping requires a Bitcoin transaction. This means you have to pay in order to wrap. This is a significant barrier. One way we are addressing the problem is by integrating open Nostr PSBT listings into Bioniq,” Bodily explained.</p><p>This integration means that PSBT listings stored on Nostr through decentralized Ordinals marketplaces OpenOrdex or Deezy Place will be accessible on Bioniq. He added that it removes the need to wrap Bitcoin transactions, as users could list directly on Bioniq using open PSBTs. </p><p>Perhaps more importantly, Bodily explained that the wrapping process requires “trust assumptions” on both protocols:</p><blockquote>“Wrapping over to ICP means in addition to trusting Bitcoin, you are now trusting the Internet Computer Protocol. Some Bitcoin users won’t want the counterparty risk of bridging assets to another chain.”</blockquote><p>Bodily adds that Bioniq is focusing on developing user experience ahead of inheriting Bitcoin’s security, which is ensured by the finality of layer-1 transactions. However, he envisions a “nice decentralization path” for applications like Bioniq.</p><p>This would involve the evolution from being built on a sidechain with additional trust assumptions to “becoming a Bitcoin sovereign rollup on ICP that is trust minimized.” The final step would see Bioniq becoming a Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) on the ICP with no additional trust assumptions, inheriting the full security and decentralization of Bitcoin. </p><blockquote>“ICP fits perfectly into this plan as well because ICP can provide a replicated execution environment (decentralized sequencer) or validium (extra off-Bitcoin storage for rollups).”</blockquote><h3>Banking on Bitcoin’s value proposition</h3><p>A number of NFT marketplaces already offer Bitcoin Ordinals auctions and trading, which begs the question of what an exclusively Ordinals platform will bring to the ecosystem. </p><p>Bodily believes that existing offerings that featured “softer pivots” to Ordinals on their platforms were hamstrung by confusing user experiences. Developing a “dedicated Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, built for Bitcoin users natively” hinges on developing a native cross-chain, BTC-ICP wallet.</p><p>In addition, Bitcoin’s unchallenged position as the preeminent and largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains another drawcard for the continued interest in Bitcoin NFTs into the future.</p><blockquote>“If you look at the numbers, 89% of people in the world have heard about Bitcoin, Bitcoin accounts for around 50% of the total crypto market cap, and Ordinals have done over $500 million in volume this year — so there is massive demand.”</blockquote><p>Bioniq joins the likes of Ordinals Market as a Bitcoin-only Ordinals marketplace. Gamma is another Ordinals marketplace that directly mints to Bitcoin’s layer-1 chain. Ordswap was an early Ordinals marketplace that has since closed down after <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-marketplace-ordswap-website-domain-hacked\">losing control of its website to hackers</a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-marketplace-ordswap-website-domain-hacked\"></a>. Meanwhile, multichain platforms like Magic Eden prominently list Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/recursive-inscriptions-bitcoin-supercomputer-defi-aws-possible/\">Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"nifty_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-double-price-barrier-breaks-analyst/",
    "description": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin breaking the $0.087 barrier could open the path to DOGE price levels nearly double the recent ones. Dogecoin Has Three Important Lines Converging At $0.087 Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed what the weekly chart of DOGE is looking like right now in terms of some important historical lines. In particular, the levels of interest here are the 100-week EMA, 200-week EMA, and 0.786 Fibonacci. A &#8220;moving average&#8221; (MA) refers to an analytical tool that calculates the mean of any given quantity over a specific period of time, and as its name implies, it moves in time and changes its value as the quantity fluctuates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric This basic tool is quite useful as it smooths out the curve by removing local fluctuations, making a study of long-term trends easier to perform. In the context of the current topic, though, a normal MA isn&#8217;t of focus, but rather a modified form called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA works like the usual MA, except it places a greater weight on the most recent readings of the quantity. What this means is that the older the reading, the less weightage it has in the metric, so the line&#8217;s changes reflect the latest price direction more strongly. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-week and 200-week EMAs for Dogecoin, as well as the weekly price curve of the meme coin: Looks like the asset's weekly value has been interacting with these lines recently &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible from the above graph, these two Dogecoin EMAs have approached each other recently and have converged into a narrow range around the $0.087 level. In the past, these two EMAs of the cryptocurrency have posed resistance to the price and it appears that the weekly chart of Dogecoin has been struggling with them again, as it has been finding rejection here during the past three weeks. These two lines aren&#8217;t the only ones converging near $0.087, however; it would appear that the 0.786 Fibonacci level is doing the same. The Fibonacci levels listed in the chart are some ratios derived from the famous Fibonacci series. In this series, dividing any number (except for the first few) by its succeeding number always gives a ratio of about 0.618. The square root of this number is 0.786, which is the level the analyst has marked here. Related Reading: XRP, BNB Among Altcoins Losing Correlation With Bitcoin: Data Dogecoin thus has a major wall at $0.087, made up of the convergence of all these historically significant lines. &#8220;Breaking past this barrier could open the gates for DOGE to nearly double its price, aiming for a target of $0.14,&#8221; explains the analyst. DOGE Price Dogecoin has observed a surge back above the $0.080 mark during the past day, as the below chart shows. It now remains to be seen if the coin will go on to retest this $0.087 level that might be so crucial for the coin. DOGE has registered some rise in the last 24 hours &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com"
