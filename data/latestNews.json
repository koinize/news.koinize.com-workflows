In addition to benefitting Ripple and XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>), analysts believe that the ruling will weaken the regulator’s case against Binance and Coinbase.</p><p>In another positive event for the crypto space, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) completed a bearish head and shoulders pattern on July 12 and followed that up with a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-btc-price-40k-dollar-dxy-last-time\">drop below the psychological level of 100</a> on July 13. The DXY typically moves in inverse correlation with Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), hence its weakness is a positive sign for the crypto bulls.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/d1d7e47b-695d-496a-a9d4-7264d160e48c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin broke and closed above the $31,000 resistance on July 13 but the bulls are struggling to build upon this strength. This suggests that the bears have not yet given up and they continue to sell at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/713e5158-e34c-4636-a7d2-738aa94bdcf1.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the upsloping moving averages indicate advantage to buyers, the relative strength index (RSI) is forming a bearish divergence, signaling that the bullish momentum may be weakening.</p><p>The bears will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $31,000. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,244). This remains the key level to keep an eye on. A bounce off it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. A rally above $32,400 could clear the path for a potential rise to $40,000.</p><p>On the other hand, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could yank the price to $29,500. The bears will have to break this support to gain the upper hand in the near term. </p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>The failure of the bears to sink Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) below the 50-day SMA in the past few days may have attracted strong buying by the bulls. That pushed the price to the overhead resistance of $2,000 on July 13.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/12596fe6-5e33-4c65-a548-59032db78675.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls and the bears may witness a tough battle near $2,000 but the rising 20-day EMA ($1,895) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that bulls have a slight edge. If buyers clear the hurdle at $2,000, the ETH/USDT pair may retest the overhead resistance zone between $2,142 and $2,200.</p><p>Another possibility is that the price turns down and drops to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to overcome the overhead obstacle. </p><p>The bears will have to tug the price below the 50-day SMA ($1,850) to weaken the bullish momentum.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($245) on July 13 and broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/c457d6f3-91a4-45a2-ba67-9536ec9e9fdc.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls continued the up-move on July 14 and pushed the price above the 50-day SMA ($257) but the bears are posing a formidable challenge near the overhead resistance at $265. If the price turns down and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the recent breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then plummet to the 20-day EMA.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the resistance line, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That will enhance the prospects of a rally above $265. The pair may then start its northward march to $280 and later to $300.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) skyrocketed above the overhead resistance of $0.56 on July 13. This meant the $0.30 to $0.56 range resolved in favor of the bulls. The pattern target of this breakout is $0.82 but the price overshot this level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/9b9f87ff-4bc6-481e-8130-3cef9d711ff0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The XRP/USDT pair is facing profit booking near $0.94. Generally, a sharp rally is followed by a violent correction and a few days of consolidation. The bulls will try to arrest any pullback in the zone between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.75 and the 50% retracement level of $0.70.</p><p>If the price stays above this level, the pair may retest the overhead resistance at $0.94. Contrarily, a break below $0.70 could sink the pair to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.64. Such a deep fall may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) witnessed aggressive buying by the bulls on July 13, which drove the price above the immediate resistance of $0.30 and the 50-day SMA ($0.31).</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/3c545316-2105-4229-a83a-47d45fb0efdf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That may have hit the stops on several bearish trades, triggering short covering. The price soared toward the target objective of $0.38 on July 14 but the long wick on the candlestick shows profit-booking by the bulls. The first support on the downside is at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.33.</p><p>If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will once again try to overcome the hurdle at $0.38. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair may rally to $0.42. Contrarily, a break below the 61.8% retracement level of $0.32 could indicate a weakening momentum.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>After trading near the $22.30 resistance for a few days, Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) made a solid move on July 13. That pushed the price to the strong overhead resistance at $27.12.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e3c0218e-5939-4783-9669-d15e88c14846.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls continued their purchase on July 14 and thrust the price above $27.12. This pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that the rally may be extended in the near term. That may result in a short-term correction or consolidation.</p><p>The important level to watch on the downside is the breakout level of $27.12. If bulls flip this level into support, the SOL/USDT pair could start a strong rally to $39. Alternatively, if bears sink and sustain the price below $27.12, the pair could descend to $22.30.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) staged a strong turnaround on July 13 and surged above the moving averages. This shows that the bulls are attempting a comeback.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/8a3cf094-1584-45e3-9eb8-cf809cee1419.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to sustain the price above the overhead resistance of $0.07. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a new up-move. The pair may then rise to $0.08 where the bears will again try to stall the rally.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.07, it could trap several aggressive bulls. The pair may then plummet to the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-cardano-price-up-today\"><strong><em>Why is Cardano price up today?</em></strong></a></p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls successfully held the 20-day EMA ($96) on July 12, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive in Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>) and traders are buying on dips.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/39a14c47-f220-4b09-a823-21f92a04db21.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rally has reached near $106 where the bulls are likely to face a solid resistance. If buyers do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will increase the likelihood of a break above $106. The LTC/USDT pair could then retest the important resistance of $115. If this level is scaled, the pair may rally to $134.</p><p>This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and closes below the 20-day EMA. The pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($90).</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>The bears tried to pull Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) back below the breakout level of $0.72 on July 12 but the bulls held their ground.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/39c49e4f-dca1-4fff-873a-2a698611d2f0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That attracted huge buying on July 13, which propelled the price to $0.89, just shy of the pattern target of $0.94. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls are in control. The up-move could reach the psychological level of $1 where the bears are expected to mount a stiff resistance.</p><p>The important support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($0.72). A break and close below it will suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) rebounded off the moving averages on July 13 and reached the overhead resistance at $5.64 on July 14.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/81207d60-f017-42c3-9c43-dd1ef5b2b025.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA ($5.20) has turned up slightly and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The DOT/USDT pair will complete a bullish inverse H&amp;S pattern on a break and close above $5.64. That could start a new up-move, which has a pattern target of $7.06.</p><p>If bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to drag and sustain the price back below $5.64. That may keep the pair range-bound between the 50-day SMA ($5.05) and $5.64 for some time.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The momentous win sees XRP become the first crypto with regulatory clarity and may be the catalyst to end the ongoing crypto winter. </p>\n<p>July 13, 2023, becomes a date that many investors and people interested in the crypto market will remember.</p>\n<p>Judge Analise Torres of the Southern District of New York handed a partial win over to Ripple Labs after its three-year-long battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\nCrypto Industry Gets a Win Amid Regulatory Crusades\n<p>Per the ruling issued by Judge Torres, Ripple&rsquo;s native $XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The decision declared that Ripple&rsquo;s XRP sales on public crypto exchanges were not offers of securities because buyers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple&rsquo;s efforts, Reuters reports. &nbsp;In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging it violated US securities laws leading many exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken, to delist XRP.</p>\n<p>Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling sets a precedent for crypto regulation leading to a shift in market momentum.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the decision was made public, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to highs after what seemed to be a never-ending market slump after the FTX collapse.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin reached a one-year high, up more than 90% for the year and almost 30% in the past month.</p>\n<p>XRP, which may now be legally sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges, skyrocketed over 70% over the past 24 hours.

    "description": "On-chain data shows a PEPE whale has made a large deposit to Binance, something that could provide an impedance to the meme coin&#8217;s rally. PEPE Whale Has Deposited $7.2 Million To Binance According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive PEPE transfer has occurred on the Ethereum blockchain during the past day. The transaction in question involved the movement of 3.94 trillion PEPE, which was worth almost $7.2 million at the time the transfer went through on the network. Generally, only the whale entities are capable of making such large moves, so it&#8217;s reasonable to assume that a whale investor would have been behind this transfer. Due to the massive amount of capital involved in transactions of these humongous investors, they can sometimes cause noticeable fluctuations in the price of the asset. As such, the movements of the whales can be something to watch out for. How such transfers may affect the market, though, depends on the exact intent the investor had behind it. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin &#38; Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Here are some additional details regarding the relevant PEPE whale transfer, which may shed some light on what the whale wanted to achieve with the move: Looks like this large transfer on the Ethereum blockchain only cost a fee of about $2.5 to go through &#124; Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this PEPE transfer is an unknown wallet, meaning that it&#8217;s an address unattached to any known centralized platform, making it likely that it&#8217;s the personal wallet of an investor. The receiving address, on the other hand, looks to be a wallet affiliated with a centralized platform. More specifically, this address is connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Transfers like these, where coins move from self-custodial wallets to exchanges are called &#8220;exchange inflows.&#8221; As one of the main reasons why investors may deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, exchange inflows can provide hints about the selling pressure in the market. In the current case, as the whale has made a rather large inflow to these platforms, it&#8217;s possible that the price of the meme coin may suffer bearish consequences from it. Naturally, this would only be so if the PEPE whale in question truly made these deposits with selling in mind, and not for using any of the other services the Binance platform offers. Though, considering that the exchange inflow has occurred following a rapid 17% rise in the meme coin&#8217;s value, there is probably a fair chance that the whale is indeed looking to sell and take advantage of this profitable exit opportunity.

So far, however, the PEPE price has only moved mostly sideways since the whale made the transfer, implying that, if the whale indeed sold the coins, the market currently has enough buying pressure that the selling has simply been absorbed. Another possibility, though, may be that the whale has only made the deposit in advance and is yet to actually the pull trigger on selling the stack, perhaps to see if the price goes up further. Naturally, if this is the case, the price would feel a bearish effect from this later down the line. PEPE Price At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.000001736, up 11% in the last week. PEPE has shot up during the past day &#124; Source: PEPEUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, chart from TradingView.com"
