    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/ada-price-0-34-cardano-founder/",
    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is again in the spotlight as crypto analysts continue to deliberate on its future trajectory. This time, crypto analyst Alan Santana has laid out a bearish narrative for the crypto token, which could cause its price to drop drastically.  How ADA Could Crash To $0.34 In his analysis, Santana stated that ADA’s breakout below the $0.58 price level, which has acted as support for the crypto token for five weeks, signals a bearish sentiment toward it. In line with this, he suggested that ADA’s price could further dip significantly even though it has already experienced a 30% decline from its recent price peak.  Related Reading: Fantom Supply On Exchanges See Drastic Increase, A Cause For Alarm? The crypto analyst mentioned that a further price dip for ADA could cause its price to drop between $0.4444 and $0.3450. However, this isn’t necessarily bad for the crypto token as Santana revealed that altcoins, which have in the past seen a 2x to 3x increase in their prices, experienced corrections of such magnitude before then.  He added that before the end of their correction, all these altcoins moved to test a price range between 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. From the chart he shared, one can see that the analyst stipulated that ADA could drop to as low as $0.34 because that is the price level for the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level.  Source: Tradingview.com Furthermore, Santana acknowledged that ADA could move higher from its current price level but seemed skeptical because the crypto token has continued to lag, making further price declines more feasible.  He also revealed that ADA’s weekly chart is producing a “break below the EMA10 (Exponential Moving Average) with a very strong bearish candle as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) turns red. “Once support is found and established, we become bullish again,” the analyst concluded.  Cardano Founder Is Bullish On ADA Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, sounded bullish on the Cardano ecosystem in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, stating that “Cardano always wins.” Hoskinson’s statement came in response to a poll to rank the best Layer-1 network. Hoskinson suggested that the poll was already biased and that Cardano would surely come out on top if it were a “fair vote.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Hitting $100,000 In 2024 Is Inevitable, Here’s Why Meanwhile, this occurrence again highlights Hoskinson&#8217;s confidence in the Cardano network he founded. He once even compared the network to Bitcoin, noting how it was growing organically like the flagship blockchain. At different times, he also insinuated that Cardano has real network value, unlike networks like Solana. However, so far, Cardano’s network value has failed to positively affect ADA’s price, which is undoubtedly a cause for concern among ADA holders.  At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.56, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
