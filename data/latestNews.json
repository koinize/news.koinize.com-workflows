The data stored in blobs is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period - which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.</p><blockquote>“In reality, the cost of rollups is down to data availability. We are writing all the data to layer one which is why we have exactly the same security. But it’s expensive, it represents 95% of the cost.”</blockquote><p>Liochon said that Linea’s prover, which essentially handles the off-chain computation that verifies, bundles and then creates a cryptographic proof of the combined transactions, only represents a fifth of the cost. </p><p>This highlights the major hurdle in making ZK-rollups the go-to scaling solution for the Ethereum ecosystem as opposed to other solutions like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/optimism-transactions-surpass-arbitrum-but-what-s-behind-the-uptick-in-users\">Optimistic rollups</a>.</p><p>Liochon also said that Linea aims to be a general use ZK-rollup that will be used for a variety of decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem. </p><blockquote>\"We are a generic rollup. We don't want to have a specific use case or specific domain. It's quite important to support all type of applications, including DeFi, gaming and social.\"</blockquote><p>As Cointelegraph previously <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/consensys-completes-public-launch-of-zkevm-linea\">reported</a>, Consensys has completed the launch of Linea in Aug. 2023, having onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in ETH.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ethereums-layer-2-zk-rollups-can-become-interoperable/\"><em>Magazine: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable</em></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
