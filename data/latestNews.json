    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-next-move-will-0-055-launch-a-recovery-phase/",
    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has found itself in a precarious position, with its price being squeezed into a narrow range, hinting at a potential decisive breakout in the near future. Market analysts closely monitor the crypto&#8217;s struggle to breach a longstanding resistance trendline, as an upside breakout could trigger a fresh rally, while a continuation of the current stalemate may lead to a further decline. Earlier this week, DOGE encountered its fifth rejection from a persistent resistance trendline that has thwarted its upward momentum. The rejection left its mark on the daily candlestick chart, characterized by a prominent high wick, indicative of aggressive overhead supply. Historical data reveals that such patterns often precede significant corrections in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge The current price of DOGE, according to CoinGecko, stands at $0.058295, with a 24-hour dip of 1.5% and a minor seven-day loss of 0.1%.  DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko In the event that the prevailing selling pressure continues, there is a high probability that the value of the coin will see a further decline of approximately 4-5%. This decline may potentially lead to a reevaluation of the annual support trendline, with a projected value of approximately $0.055. Presently, the price of this memecoin is situated inside the confines of two prominent trendlines, indicating an impending occurrence of either a definitive upward surge or a downward decline. Dogecoin: Glimpse Of Hope Amidst Mixed Data Despite the gloomy price outlook, there is a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts. The report also predicts that if the coin manages to sustain a breakout above the resistance trendline, investors could witness a sharp 16.8% surge, targeting the $0.068 level. This possibility is poised to keep traders and investors on the edge of their seats. On the other hand, data from IntoTheBlock reveals some intriguing insights into DOGE&#8217;s current state. It&#8217;s been found that a significant portion of DOGE addresses, specifically 61%, are currently at a loss. Source: IntoTheBlock A deeper dive into the data exposes the fact that only 31% of the total DOGE holders are in profit, highlighting the challenging landscape for DOGE investors. An additional 10% of holders remain in a neutral position, while a substantial 59% of Dogecoin holders find themselves in a losing position. DOGE’s Silver Lining One silver lining in this scenario is the fact that 72% of DOGE holders have maintained their positions for over a year, signifying a strong commitment to the digital asset. A further 26% of holders have held DOGE for a duration ranging from one month to 12 months, while 2% of holders have relatively shorter-term positions, spanning less than a month. DOGE market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As the Dogecoin community eagerly awaits the impending breakout or breakdown, the cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and uncertain space, where opportunities and risks are constantly shifting.
