But rather than retrain the model, Google has massively overcorrected with its aggressive hidden system prompt and inadvertently created a parody of an AI so borked by ideology that its practically useless.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/google-fix-diversity-borked-gemini-chatgpt-goes-insane-ai-eye/\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
