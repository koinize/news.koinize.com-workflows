Steve Womack outlined that the SEC, among other government agencies, had fallen prey to regulatory overreach and were becoming an undue financial burden on the government. </p><p>Womack said that the best course of action would be to defund the SEC, to help limit its regulatory “intrusiveness” while forcing the regulator to return focus to its core mission.</p><blockquote>“Specifically, we turn off rulemakings at the Securities and Exchange Commission that lack proper cost-benefit analysis and aggregate impact analysis.”</blockquote><p>“To be clear, the agencies under our jurisdiction perform important functions; however, many have strayed from their mandate and the results have been a true disservice to the American people,” Womack added.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are on an unsustainable trajectory. <br><br>My bill reins in wasteful Washington spending to address our dire fiscal situation. <a href=\"https://t.co/lWgyvHknQQ\">https://t.co/lWgyvHknQQ</a></p>&mdash; Rep.
