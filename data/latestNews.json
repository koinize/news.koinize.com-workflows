    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-exchanges-6-year-low/",
    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) held by leading crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are near a six-year low, CryptoQuant data on September 20 reveals. The contraction was recorded when the broader market steadied after posting sharp losses in the better part of August and the first half of September. As of September 20, BTC prices are still below $30,000, but with important sideways movement over the past few weeks.  Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Falling  According to trackers, exchanges control 2.09 million BTC when writing. In total, the Bitcoin network will issue 21 million coins. However, as of 2023, over 19.7 million are in circulation, and public firms such as Tesla—the electric car automaker—and MicroStrategy—the business intelligence firm—have been loading up. Generally, entities can hold cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets or exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Exchanges offer custodial wallets where users can store their coins to trade or even HODL. Users who hold their coins on exchanges can easily swap them for USDT or other altcoins. As mentioned, the number of coins held in exchanges continues to contract—which, while on the surface can be bullish, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean prices will recover. Related Reading: Ethereum Path To $1,700 – Predictions For The Week Ahead Typically, coin outflows from exchanges can signal a firming market and expectation of price expansion. However, considering the current regulatory environment, traders and Bitcoin holders might prefer taking control of their coins as fear sets in. Accordingly, more holders secure their coins in their non-custodial wallets as a protective measure, possibly explaining the dropping Bitcoin exchange reserves. SEC, Regulators Tough On Exchanges The number of Bitcoin held in exchanges has been falling throughout 2022 but appeared to have dropped faster in late 2022. Around that time, FTX, a popular crypto exchange, collapsed, locking billions worth of clients&#8217; funds.  Outflow slowed down in Q1 2023 following the collapse of some regional banks in the United States but has since continued falling. The dip can be attributed to the bear market but primarily because the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking the whip on Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of non-compliance.

Since then, there have been major staff resignations, layoffs, and disruption of operations. Trading volume in Binance US is now down by over 95%.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

    "description": "Bitcoin price is struggling to clear the $27,500 resistance. BTC is slowly moving lower and might revisit the $26,200 support zone in the coming sessions. Bitcoin is still struggling to clear the $27,500 resistance. The price is trading above $26,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $26,810 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a bearish wave below $26,800 if it continues to struggle below $27,500. Bitcoin Price Faces Rejection Bitcoin price made a couple of attempts to gain strength for a move above the $27,500 resistance zone. However, BTC failed to continue higher and slowly moved lower after the Fed interest rate decision. The Fed kept the rates steady at 5.5% and it did not impact Bitcoin much. The price is now moving lower below the $27,200 level. There was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $26,656 swing low to the $27,495 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $26,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $26,810 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If the price remains stable above the trend line, it could rise again. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,280 level. The first major resistance is near the $27,500 zone, above which the price could gain bullish momentum. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be near the $28,200 level. A close above the $28,200 resistance could push the price toward the $29,500 resistance. Any more gains might call for a move toward the $30,000 level in the coming days. Downside Break In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to start a fresh increase above the $27,280 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26,855 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $26,656 swing low to the $27,495 high. The next major support is near the $26,800 level and the trend line. A downside break and close below the $26,800 level might spark more bearish moves and the price could decline toward the next support at $26,200. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $26,800, followed by $26,200. Major Resistance Levels – $27,280, $27,500, and $28,200."
