    "description": "The ever-vibrant Shiba Inu community is thriving once more as SHIB gains widespread recognition surpassing top cryptocurrency assets in the market to become the second most sought-after digital asset in the entire European continent, securing its stance in the crypto landscape. Shiba Inu Takes Europe By Storm XRP enthusiast and market expert Marcel Knobloch, also known as Collin Brown, reported the coin&#8217;s latest milestone on X. According to Brown, Shiba Inu has seen significant growth in its long-term investor base, taking Europe by storm by becoming the second most search crypto in the continent. Brown noted that the milestone is reminiscent of the peak of 2021, having rallied a startling 300% in just 8 days. SHIB&#8217;s interest is not limited to Europe, and it has taken the top spot on search charts all the way from Italy to Nigeria. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Over The Internet: Google Searches Climb As Global Interest Surges As a result of the development, WazirX&#8217;s poll has crowned SHIB the king of meme cryptos. Thus, Collin Brown has urged the cryptocurrency space to watch out for Shiba Inu, noting that the Shiba pack is at the forefront of the race. The rankings were determined following a comprehensive analysis of Google Trends data in the past 1 year in order to ascertain the cryptocurrency that, based on searches, each nation in Europe desires to invest in. After gathering collective data, the findings showed a noteworthy pattern that indicated changes in people&#8217;s interest in the crypto market. Shiba Inu went past notable coins like Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; the second largest crypto asset, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) &#8211; the largest meme coin, securing the top pick in about 7 European countries. These include Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and among others.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) &#8211; the largest crypto asset remains the most searched coin in the continent acquiring top choice in about 21 European nations, such as Poland, Germany, Belgium, Romania, etc. Latest Milestone Buttresses SHIB&#8217;s Price SHIB&#8217;s recent achievement displays a constant rise in its interest, reflecting the trust of its community members around the world. In addition to bolstering SHIB&#8217;s standing, this ranking indicates that European investors are considering adopting the token even more. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Blooms: BONE Jumps 44% With $3 Target In Sight Following the project&#8217;s landmark, the Ethereum-based memecoin has managed to secure gains of over 18% in the past week. SHIB has experienced a rebound to the $0.000030 threshold, after falling as low as $0.000025 during the start of the week. With the memecoin market demonstrating momentum presently, SHIB might be poised for more significant gains in the coming months. Consequently, SHIB&#8217;s rise to the aforementioned price has taken advantage of the market&#8217;s general recovery and its seven-day upswing. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000305, indicating a decline of 1% in the past day. Meanwhile, its trading volume and market cap have decreased by over 1% and 16%, respectively.  Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
