    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/",
    "description": "Standard Chartered&#8217;s latest research notes offer a very bullish outlook for the major digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), by the end of 2024 and beyond. The bank&#8217;s analysts project Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit the $8,000 mark. These projections come amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the crypto space, including the launch of Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Ethereum&#8217;s recent Dencun upgrade. Bitcoin&#8217;s Path To $150,000 The bank&#8217;s research delves deep into the factors propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s potential surge to $150,000 by year-end. Central to this projection is the influence of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which, since their launch on January 11, have seen rapid inflows exceeding increases in open interest. Related Reading: Analyst Expects Bitcoin Price Correction To Persist, Targets $57,000 Support According to the bank, this suggests a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, distinct from previous speculative peaks. &#8220;Rapid inflows to the new Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs have dominated [&#8230;] Most of the inflows are likely to be sticky pension-type flows,&#8221; Geoff Kendrick and Suki Cooper elucidate, highlighting the newfound stability in Bitcoin investment trends. Three pivotal analyses form the cornerstone of Standard Chartered&#8217;s Bitcoin valuation: Gold Analogy: Drawing parallels with the gold market&#8217;s response to the introduction of US gold ETFs, the bank estimates Bitcoin could rise to the $200,000 level, marking a 4.3x increase from its pre-ETF price. Two-Asset Optimization: By optimizing a portfolio with 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin at current gold prices, the analysis suggests a Bitcoin level around $190,000. ETF Inflows Correlation: Linear extrapolation based on the correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price points to a possible $250,000 level, assuming total ETF inflows around the bank&#8217;s midpoint estimate of $75 billion. Standard Chartered notes that these three measures suggest “that $200,000 is the &#8216;correct&#8217; end-2025 price level for BTC, [&#8230;] and that it is likely to be the new midpoint for a sideways trading range at that time.” Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Convinced Bitcoin Is Headed For $150,000, Here’s Why Further the research notes that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if ETF inflows continue apace and/or reserve managers buy BTC.” Previously, the bank only predicted a Bitcoin price of $100,000 by the end of 2024. Ethereum&#8217;s Road To $8,000 Ethereum&#8217;s expected climb to $8,000 by the end of 2024 is anchored in two transformative developments: the Dencun upgrade and the expected approval of ETH spot ETFs. The recent Dencun upgrade, by significantly lowering transaction costs on layer 2 blockchains, enhances Ethereum&#8217;s competitive edge. &#8220;Ethereum (ETH) has just undergone the ‘Dencun’ upgrade, which dramatically lowers the cost of transactions [&#8230;] making ETH more competitive,&#8221; the research notes. The forecast also hinges on the anticipation of US SEC approval for ETH ETFs by May 23, a decision poised to catalyze substantial inflows into Ethereum. Drawing from the Bitcoin ETF experience, Standard Chartered expects similar enthusiasm for Ethereum, with projected inflows of 2.39-9.15 million ETH (equivalent to roughly $15-45 billion). This substantial capital infusion is seen as a crucial lever for Ethereum&#8217;s price surge. &#8220;We expect significant ETF-driven inflows to ETH [&#8230;] This could drive ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2024,&#8221; the bank elaborates, underscoring the parallel potential for growth akin to Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory. The Prognosis For 2025 And Beyond Looking further ahead, Standard Chartered ventures into the terrain of 2025 predictions, where the bank sees the ETH-to-BTC price ratio ascending back to the 7% level, a hallmark of the 2021-22 period. This adjustment forecasts an Ethereum price of $14,000 by the end of 2025, given the projected Bitcoin level of $200,000. Such a scenario underscores the bank&#8217;s optimism about the enduring value proposition and growth potential of these leading digital assets in the medium term. At press time, BTC traded at $68,401. Featured image created with DALL·E, chart from TradingView.com"
