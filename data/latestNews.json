    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-vs-bitcoin-can-upcoming-eth-futures/",
    "description": "The Ethereum price is hovering around yearly lows compared to the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This decline, notable since September 2022, has brought ETH to trade as low as $1,594 at the time of writing. However, amid the concerns about Ethereum&#8217;s notable plunge, there are hints of a potential trend reversal, according to the latest report from crypto research firm K33 Research. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stages Recovery But Can It Overcome This Key Hurdle? Ethereum Price Declines, Underlying Reasons K33 Research, a renowned figure in the crypto analytical space, has been closely monitoring the relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Their recent findings highlight a palpable drift in the market&#8217;s preferences between these two titans. Ethereum&#8217;s native token is under strain, hovering at a trading value near 0.06 Bitcoin. This trend traces back to a pivotal moment in Ethereum&#8217;s timeline – its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus, a migration dubbed &#8220;The Merge.&#8221; However, Ethereum&#8217;s trajectory isn&#8217;t solely a product of its internal variation. External market factors have also played their part. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) sectors have seen their buzz quiet down, which has indirectly cast a shadow over Ethereum&#8217;s performance. Lunde, a Senior Analyst with K33, alongside Vice President Anders Helseth, reflected on this scenario in their recent report. The analysts pointed out: Ether has experienced a steady downward trend throughout the year as DeFi and NFT activity has faded. Without any meaningful narratives or adoption stories, ether has struggled to maintain strength versus bitcoin Market Sentiments And Potential Catalysts Furthermore, insights from Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) derivative traders reveal a bearish sentiment towards Ethereum. According to the report, despite a notable 60% surge in open interest since August, the disparity between ETH futures prices and its spot remains considerably lower than that of Bitcoin. Lunde and Helseth interpret this data to suggest that expectations of potential ETH futures ETFs being approved in the forthcoming weeks failed to gain the attention of the CME Ethereum traders. However, not everything appears grim for Ethereum. Despite the bearish landscape, analysts at K33 are optimistic about a shift as the year ends. According to the report, the potential approval of new Ethereum futures-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could reverse this trend. Such financial products could infuse new vigor into the market, attracting more institutional interest and potentially driving Ethereum&#8217;s value against Bitcoin. If approved, they could not only bolster the confidence of existing investors but might also lure new participants to the ETH platform.
