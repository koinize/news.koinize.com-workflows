(PROJECT XENO)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developed by Japan-based CROOZ Blockchain Lab, Project Xeno is a tactical turn-based player versus player (PvP) game where players can battle each other using their NFT characters. It has a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/play2earn-blockchain-gaming-economies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >play-to-earn model</a>, which rewards players for their in-game achievements with crypto assets.</p><p>Xenos are NFT characters used in battles that can be upgraded with leveling, weapons (that are NFTs) and charms (also NFTs). Each Xeno has two passive skills and a special skill. Special skills can be used by spending a special meter and leveling up using the in-game currency.</p><p>The players can put their three Xenos wherever they like in a 3×3 space. Characters are divided into six classes, which can equip four skill cards each. There are glimpses of a team-building aspect and some effort to put strategy elements in, but it needs some improvements.</p><p>The English translation is done poorly, with many examples, such as the Skill strengthen tab in the shop. Progression feels very slow and requires quite a bit of grinding if you are not willing to spend money. It’s a no from me, but if youd like to check the game out, Project Xeno is free-to-play and downloadable on Android and iOS.</p><p>The gameplay is fairly simple. It made me wonder if itd be more fun if Project Xeno were an auto-battler or an idle game, as it felt like it didnt even need me around to play the game at times. The graphics are fun, but dont expect too much on that front.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"PROJECT XENO CM 30ver /202310\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ovk0Z0Z13A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-from-web3-gaming-space\">More from Web3 gaming space:</h2><p> Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform Sui <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceandTimeDB/status/1721891931767414842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >teams</a> up with Space and Time to provide Web3 game developers with zero-knowledge-proof-based tools.</p><p> Immutable <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/204145/elemental-knights-spinoff-leads-new-games-coming-immutable-zkevm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >announces</a> four upcoming Web3 games for its zero-knowledge scaling solution, zkEVM: GensoKishi Online, Cursed Stone, Sailwars and <a href=\"https://x.com/Immutable/status/1721573751186416084?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Rave</a>.</p><p>Illuvium is set to launch on the <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/illuvium-60064c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Epic Store</a> Nov. 28.</p><p> Decentralized cloud provider Aethir <a href=\"https://www.aethir.com/blog-posts/aethir-joins-nvidia-inception-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >gets</a> backing from Nvidia.</p><p> Grammy-nominated DJ and world-famous music producer Steve Aoki <a href=\"https://stepnofficial.medium.com/syncing-beats-and-steps-stepn-x-steve-aoki-436139ade62c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >collaborates</a> with STEPN for a digital sneaker collection.</p><p> Ronin-based mobile RTS game Wild Forest <a href=\"https://x.com/playwildforest/status/1720425479264678122?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >begins</a> open beta on Nov. 9.</p><p> Solana Labs <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/solana-labs-gameshift-delivers-the-next-generation-of-game-development-with-beta-launch-301972704.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >launches</a> the beta version of GameShift, a Web3 service for game developers.</p><div class=\"subscribe subscribe--inner\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"subscribe__inner\"><div class=\"subscribe__content\">    <div class=\"subscribe__title display2\">Subscribe</div>    <div class=\"subscribe__desc text-l\">The most engaging reads in blockchain.

    "description": "Crypto exchange platform Poloniex was attacked by a bad actor, losing over $60 million of its customer&#8217;s funds. The Justin Sun led the exchange and launched an investigation, which remains ongoing, to determine the identity of the attackers. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars Over 3,000% – What’s The Impact On Price? Poloniex Makes Offering To Attackers The crypto analytics platform Nansen data indicates that over $68 million in tokens left Poloniex over the past day. The image below shows that the attacker stole assets in ETH, BADGER, REN, OKB, NEXO, and 170 other tokens. Nansen also confirmed that the biggest losses were suffered in top assets, Ethereum and USDT, with around $11 million each. Other tokens such as ELON, USDC, SHIB, and GLM saw inferior losses but still in the millions of dollars. A few hours ago, as mentioned, the exchange launched an investigation and Justin assured its users that the platform keeps a “healthy financial position.” In that sense, Sun, also the founder of blockchain TRON, claimed that users will be reimbursed for their losses. The platform is currently exploring a partnership with other crypto exchanges to recover the fund. Sun stated: We are offering a 5% white hat bounty to the Poloniex hacker. Please return the funds to the following ETH/TRX/BTC wallets. We will give you 7 days to consider this offer before we engage law enforcement. In the crypto community, some users praised these efforts to recover the fund and encouraged the attacker or attackers to take the bounty for “pointing out vulnerabilities” in the platform’s security. However, other users were critical of the measure. One community member stated: (…) a white hat doesn&#8217;t steal funds and then ask for a bounty, whatever you&#8217;re promising, law enforcement will be involved. It&#8217;s like saying you can beat someone to death but if you take them to the hospital you&#8217;ll be safe (…). Who Is Behind The Poloniex Attack? It remains to be seen if the attacker will accept the offer. In the crypto space, many cyberattacks have been conducted by state-sponsored hacker groups, such as the infamous Lazarus Group, allegedly working for the North Korean Government. According to a report from our sister website, Bitcoinist, this group stole billions of dollars from the nascent industry in the past two years. The terrorist group is allegedly a key component of the country’s nuclear program. Jason Bartlett, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), said: Cryptocurrency offers Pyongyang a new kind of currency that is substantially less regulated and understood by national governments, financial institutions, and international organizations. However, cryptocurrencies also operate as an important tool for law enforcement agencies to track down and cut funding for rogue entities. Due to blockchain technology&#8217;s transparency, some criminals stay clear of digital assets and crypto exchanges.
