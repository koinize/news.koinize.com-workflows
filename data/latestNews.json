After the Hong Kong watchdog’s warning to the exchange, the platform <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpex-increases-withdrawal-fee-to-almost-1k-after-warning-from-hong-kong-s-watchdog\">reportedly increased its withdrawal fee to $1,0000</a> to discourage users from withdrawing their assets.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-changpeng-zhao-deny-fud-liquidity-employee-turnover\"><strong><em>Binance CEO brushes off negativity, assures firm has ‘no liquidity issues’</em></strong></a></p><p>The crypto <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpex-blames-market-makers-hong-kong-liquidity-crisis\">exchange later blamed third-party market makers</a> for the ongoing liquidity crisis on the platform that resulted in the hike of the withdrawal fee. The Hong Kong police also arrested influencer Joseph Lam (Lin Zuo) for his association with crypto exchange JPEX.</p><p>Hong Kong established itself as a growing crypto hub in 2023 working on various pro-crypto legislation and opening the crypto trading market for retail customers. However, unlicensed crypto platforms like JPEX have managed to fool many users in the country due to a lack of knowledge and awareness. The regulatory body is now working to educate people on using only licensed platforms for their crypto trading activities.</p><p><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-influencer-arrest-hong-kong-jpex&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\"><strong><em>Collect this article as an NFT</em></strong></a><strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
