Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1720516605933756514\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">broke</a> the news on X (formerly Twitter), saying the company was launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team.</p><p>OpenSea launched in 2017, when NFTs were an innovation.

It <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-20-of-its-staff-citing-crypto-winter\">laid off 20% of its employees</a> in July 2022, citing the crypto winter, after which it had a staff of 230, according to press <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/opensea-nft-marketplace-layoffs-crypto-winter-1234634226/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reports</a> at the time. A spokesperson at the pioneering marketplace told Cointelegraph by email:</p><blockquote>“Today, we are making significant organizational and operating changes as we focus on building a more nimble – and ultimately better – version of OpenSea. We are immensely grateful for the contributions of those who are leaving OpenSea, and we are supporting them with a robust package consisting of both financial and non-financial support.” </blockquote><p>The spokesperson added that around 50% of employees would be affected across all functions and particularly mentioned that the number of middle managers would be reduced. The employees would receive four-month severance packages, accelerated equity vesting and six months of continued healthcare and mental health care. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-nft-prices-spike-following-release-mugshot\">Donald Trump NFT prices spike following release of mugshot in Georgia criminal case</a></em></strong></p><p>The market for collectible <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-nft-markets-in-a-death-spiral-or-ready-for-a-resurgence\">NFTs peaked in 2021</a>.
