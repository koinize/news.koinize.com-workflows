The demonstration at IAA Mobility highlighted <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/100-teslas-democratize-and-decentralize-web3-ride-sharing\">autonomous transactions between connected devices</a> - in this case, a smart car, charging station, and signal for parking. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/b49e58b9-2f59-46bf-b0c8-9942f1725e75.jpeg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">A Jaguar electric vehicle(EV) showcasing decentralized tech w/ integrated payment abilities. Source: Cointelegraph</figcaption></figure><p>Cointelegraph was on the ground in Munich and spoke with Peter Busch, the project lead for moveID and product owner for Distributed Ledger Technologies (Mobility) at Bosch, along with Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder of Peaq, to understand better how blockchain is helping push forward the future of mobility.  </p><p>When asked why mobility was the right sector to begin implementing SSI on a large scale, Dorlöchter pointed out that “with mobility especially, there's a lot of fragmentation.” </p><p>When it comes to mobility, the goal for users is to move from one point to the other point. This is done via public transport, micro-mobility scooters, car sharing, or personal cars, which need parking spots and charging.</p><p>“There are many players involved and always requiring sign-ups with new accounts, new cards, etc.. If this is happening on the blockchain, an open ecosystem, then everyone can have a seamless experience and also find the best services, best parking and charging spots.” </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/88e609de-39de-4ab7-b9a2-234a493fc823.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A Jaguar electric vehicle (EV)  equipped with a moveID communicating with a traffic light to signal charging availability via blockchain transactions.

It will be available to all the citizens and all the businesses who would like to use it,” he said.</p><p>All of this is part of a larger European Union-funded initiative called Gaia-X, that intends to create a federated, secure data infrastructure for European digital sovereignty and lay the foundations for future smart cities.  </p><p>Therefore, Busch stressed the importance of “designing systems that people can use easily.\"</p><p>“Any citizen in maybe like five to eight years will have this automatically and won’t have to think about it because, as you have your personal ID as a card in your wallet today, it will be digitally or electronically somewhere.”</p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bosch-partners-in-100-million-web3-development-foundation\"><strong><em>Bosch partners with AI firm for $100M fund to empower Web3 development</em></strong></a></p><p>According to the Peaq co-founder, a smart city of the future as envisioned by these projects will be a web of “interconnected things” that need to have an identity and an open system. </p><blockquote>“If we look into the future and think about smart cities, they wouldn't work and function if they were built on a Web2 platform as we know them today.”</blockquote><p>“Things become alive by having an identity - it's their passport,” he said. In the case of the example seen at IAA Mobility, this is smart cars, charging stations and traffic lights.“Once they have that identity, users can find and identify with them. Then you can really create a smart city.” </p><blockquote>“The Internet of Things (IoT) turns into the Economy of Things (EoT) because all of those things have some economic value and that's the future. The future of AI automation will be economic activity and machines will do what's necessary to support society.”</blockquote><p>Creating an IoT, and therefore an EoT is similar to nation-building in the digital space. Dorlöchter concluded by saying that in order for any of this to happen these systems need to be “open and decentralized systems.” </p><p>Most importantly they need to have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-economy-anticipating-the-central-role-of-crypto-payments-in-financial-transactions\">an interoperability component</a> that makes it so “everyone can participate in the earnings.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/blockchain-games-decentralized-lattice-starknet-cartridge/\"><strong><em>Blockchain games aren’t really decentralized… but that’s about to change</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
