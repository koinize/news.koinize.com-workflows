At its peak in 2022, Fantom's TVL topped $7.5 billion. The price of its native coin Fantom (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/fantom-ftm-price-index\">FTM</a>) <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">declined</a> from $0.41 to $0.28 over the same period.</p><p>\"Multichain was a big blow, Cronje <a href=\"https://forum.fantom.network/t/andre-cronje-infinite-ama/158/326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a Fantom's forum thread, adding that he \"had a lot of assurances from the [Multichain] team around the server decentralization, access, and geolocation distribution. Don’t trust, verify (saying this to myself).\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e4b542fa-aa83-4444-b03d-3ecec5ddfc31.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fantom's Total Value Locked .

These withdrawals represented the majority of funds held on each bridge.</p><p>Multichain <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fantom-based-lender-geist-finance-shuts-down-permanently-over-multichain-hack\">was storing all shards of its private keys</a> in a “cloud server account” under the sole control of its CEO, Cointelegraph reported. This cloud server account was later used by someone to drain funds from the protocol.</p><p>The ripple effect of Multichain's issues also affected the lending protocol Geist Finance, which <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fantom-based-lender-geist-finance-shuts-down-permanently-over-multichain-hack\">was forced to shut down</a> permanently due to losses from the exploit. Prior to the hack, over $29 million worth of crypto assets were locked in contracts running on the Fantom network. As such, Geist closing had a massive impact on Fantom's TVL. </p><p>In response to the exploit, stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-tether-freezes-over-65m-in-assets-transferred-from-multichain\">have frozen over $65 million in assets</a> tied to the attack. Fantom is said to be engaging with both companies for native issuance and reviewing rollups for native bridge infrastructure. \"We are exploring all options at this point, working with relevant organizations to try and recover assets,\" Cronje noted. </p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-executor-has-been-draining-anyswap-tokens-report&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
