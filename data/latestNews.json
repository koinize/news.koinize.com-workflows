    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/matic-price-rocket-above-1-5/",
    "description": "The MATIC price has gained quickly making it one of the top gainers in the last day. But even after growing so much, crypto analysts think that the main event is only beginning, expecting the token to cross the $1 mark once more and make it above $1.5. MATIC Price Could Mount 76% Rally To $1.5 Crypto analyst Babenski has laid out a scenario where the MATIC price could rise back above $1.5. The token has seen investors eagerly await its return and it is expected to be glorious. As the analyst outlines, the Polygon native token is still facing a bit of a resistance but a breakout above the $0.9 would spark a surge. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals One Major Reason The XRP Price Will Do Well In The Bull Run The analyst explains that the price is being held back but is trying to break out of the A&#38;V pattern. Even the fact that the altcoin is trying to break out of this pattern is bullish and a complete break could see it rise up and clear the coveted $1 level. Source: Tradingview.com Also, this breakout could see the price rise as high as 76%, as Babenski notes. Such a surge would bring MATIC above $1.5. If this happens, it will be the first time in almost a year that the MATIC price has crossed this level and could signal the start of another bull rally. Maintaining A Bullish Outlook In addition to Babenki, another crypto analyst has taken to TradingView to share their own bullish outlook on the MATIC price. This time around, Nathan at MyCryptoParadise presents their analysis with the fact that MATIC seems to have a well-executed rounding bottom pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says One Day Left Until XRP Price Blast-Off, What To Expect Then using the daily candle, the analyst predicts a potential to break out from its current supply area. “A successful breakout would pave the way for MATIC to probability advance toward our targeted supply area,” Nathan said. The outcome and the expected peak of this breakout, although not as high as Babenski’s forecast, also put the price above $1.1. Source: Tradingview.com However, it is not a completely smooth road for the MATIC price here. This is because the analyst says that if the altcoin comes across any difficulty in breaking the supply area, then it could trigger a downtrend. This would cause the price to dip and head toward demand at $0.69. “The undesirable scenario unfolds if, during the retesting at the demand of $0.69, MATIC struggles to sustain its position and breaches the demand area,” says Nathan. “In such a case, MATIC would revert to a bearish movement, potentially retracing to the robust support area.” MATIC recovers to $0.93 &#124; Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com"
