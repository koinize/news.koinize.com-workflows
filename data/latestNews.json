Also, in March, Alameda Ventures paid another $25 million for 100 million STG tokens at a public auction, to be distributed over a period of six months beginning in March 2023.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Super excited to work with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LayerZero_Labs</a>!<br><br>They&#39;re building out a key missing piece of crypto infrastructure--cross-chain liquidity.<br><br>And more importantly, they&#39;re doing a great job of building great products. <a href=\"https://t.co/TvEC6sfpeE\">https://t.co/TvEC6sfpeE</a></p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1509223825778561027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Amidst these transactions, in February, LayerZero loaned $45 million to Alameda Ventures’ parent, Alameda Research, under a promissory note bearing an annual interest rate of 8%.</p><p>When FTX's crisis unfolded in early November, LayerZero<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/layerzero-labs-bought-back-its-stake-from-ftx-ventures-and-alameda\"> sought a deal for the return of its stake owned by Alameda</a>. The agreement included the return of shares to LayerZero in exchange for the forgiveness of the $45 million loan. Another deal related to 100 million STG tokens was also reached, which LayerZero purchased back at a discount for $10 million on Nov. 9. This transaction, however, was never completed. LayerZero did not pay for the tokens, and Alameda Ventures did not transfer the tokens.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">put simply<br><br>we did indeed buy all of the tokens (back)<br><br>better is better<br><br>- RAZ &amp; Bryan <a href=\"https://t.co/anBSloYRLV\">https://t.co/anBSloYRLV</a></p>&mdash; raz (@ryanzarick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanzarick/status/1590765802281906177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>FTX alleges in the lawsuit that LayerZero exploited Alameda Ventures during a liquidity crisis:</p><blockquote>\"LayerZero was well aware that Alameda Research was facing a liquidity crisis and, within about 24 hours, negotiated a fire-sale transaction with Caroline Ellison, Alameda Research’s then-CEO.”</blockquote><p>Along with the agreements’ cancellation, the complaint seeks recovery of funds withdrawn days before FTX bankruptcy filing, including approximately $21.37 million from LayerZero Labs, as well as $13.07 million from Ari Litan, its former chief operating officer, and $6.65 million from a subsidiary, Skip &amp; Goose.</p><p>LayerZero Labs isn't the first company to be sued by FTX. The bankrupt company <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-seeks-to-claw-back-4b-from-genesis-in-a-battle-of-the-bankrupt\">is also attempting to recoup billions</a> in funds from transactions made by a number of subsidiaries before the collapse of its conglomerate. </p><p>Cointelegraph reached out to LayerZero Labs, but did not receive a response at the time of publication. The lawsuit is not related to LayerZero Power Systems, a company that owns the LayerZero trademark and does not operate in the crypto industry.  </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/how-smart-people-invest-in-dumb-memecoins-3-point-plan-for-success/\"><strong><em>How smart people invest in dumb memecoins — 3-point plan for success</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
