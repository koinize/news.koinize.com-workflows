    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-bounces-back-to-26000-heres-why/",
    "description": "In a swift turnaround from yesterday&#8217;s dip, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to nearly $26,000 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This recovery, which saw the BTC  climb from $25,210 to $25,973 in a mere 30 minutes (from 3:00 am to 3:30 am UTC), was not driven by any specific news event. Instead, the dynamics within the Bitcoin futures market played a pivotal role. Why Has The Bitcoin Price Bounced Upwards? Renowned analyst Skew provided a technical perspective on the price movement, referring to it as a &#8220;textbook short squeeze.&#8221; Delving deeper into Skew&#8217;s analysis, he pointed out a clear divergence in the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) of perpetual contracts (or &#8220;perps&#8221;) with the actual price. In trading, a divergence between CVD and price can signal a potential reversal. In this context, while sellers were trying to push the price below $25,000, the CVD indicated that buying pressure was mounting. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly TD Sequential Buy Setup Appears, But Warns Of Potential Risk Furthermore, the futures market had a high number of short positions relative to the open interest (OI), and the funding rate was negative. A negative funding rate typically means that shorts are paying longs, indicating a bearish sentiment. Despite attempts to drive the price down, Bitcoin was reclaiming its swing long price level at $25,300 and failed to maintain the bearish trend in the lower time frame (LTF). The spot market, where assets are bought and sold for immediate delivery, was showing signs of a bullish structure change, with prices gradually moving higher. Skew suggested that the culmination of these factors led to a short squeeze, where those who bet against the market (short sellers) are forced to buy back into the market to cover their positions, further driving up the price. Skew&#8217;s analysis essentially highlights that while there was a bearish sentiment with many traders betting against Bitcoin, underlying indicators were hinting at a potential bullish reversal. For traders, the immediate goal post-squeeze is to reclaim $26,000. TheKingfisher offered a more succinct take, hinting at the short squeeze and its impact on those who were betting against Bitcoin: &#8220;See you around high lev shorters. BTC Cleared them again.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop? Axel Adler Jr. shed light on the broader market sentiment, noting, &#8220;Traders do not plan to go any lower. Net Taker Volume has risen by 9.79%. Over the past year, this is a new record for the balance of open Taker orders with long positions.&#8221; Despite the rapid price movement, the short squeeze&#8217;s magnitude was relatively modest. Coinglass data reveals that about $12.32 million in BTC shorts were liquidated. For context, the most significant short liquidation event in the last three months occurred on August 17, amounting to $120 million, when BTC briefly dipped to $24,700 before making a quick recovery above $26,600. The decline in open interest in futures on the major exchanges was also rather small. According to Coinglass, open interest fell from $10.66 billion to $10.65 billion. This slight decline suggests that few traders had to close their bets, with funding rates turning positive, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment. At press time, BTC stood at $25,768.
