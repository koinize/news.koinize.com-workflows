In Episode 38 of Cointelegraph’s<em> Hashing It Out</em>, Elisha Owusu Akyaw talks to Joel Kuck, CEO of Decentralized ETF (D-ETF), about how ETFs work, the potential impact of spot Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) ETFs on the cryptocurrency industry and the idea of decentralized ETFs.</p><p>Amid the optimism that U.S. regulators are set to greenlight multiple spot BTC ETFs, some projects are also looking to bring other ETFs to the blockchain while riding the wave of hype around the investment products. Kuck explains why the industry is bullish about spot Bitcoin ETFs and why the excitement around them is mounting. </p><p>He explains that direct exposure to Bitcoin for institutional investors and funds through spot ETFs will boost adoption, which wasn’t previously feasible because some investors were unwilling to touch Bitcoin directly and be responsible for the self-custody of their assets. </p><p>According to Kuck, ETFs are an important wealth management and investment instrument that must be available for people in developing markets. He explains that this is the background for the creation of decentralized ETFs. This new classification of ETFs intends to take traditional ETFs to the blockchain, providing exposure for users who would otherwise not have access due to their jurisdiction or other barriers. </p><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2096415\"></template><p>As 2023 comes to an end, <em>Hashing It Out</em> guests are asked to share their thoughts about the future of crypto and give their projections for 2024. Kuck said he is bullish that we will see a spot Bitcoin ETF soon and multiple similar products in the next five years. Moreover, he expects an increase in the tokenization of real-world assets, and the opening up of fractional ownership of assets like real estate powered by the blockchain. </p><p>Listen to the full episode of <em>Hashing It Out </em>on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hashing-it-out/id1658998696?app=podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ibvcrJ87PAso4DBIiE5qn?si=5071800991044f7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a> or <a href=\"https://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/Hashing-It-Out-p3083469/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TuneIn</a>.

In 2022, the ECB chief argued that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-president-s-anti-crypto-comments-trigger-community-responses\">cryptocurrencies are “worth nothing”</a> because the assets are “based on nothing.” In 2021, the ECB president also predicted that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-s-lagarde-says-central-banks-holding-bitcoin-out-of-the-question\">central banks worldwide would not be holding Bitcoin anytime soon</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-regulator-casps-protocol-interoperability-self-hosted-wallets\"><strong><em>European regulator: CASPs should work on protocol interoperability, self-hosted wallets</em></strong></a></p><p>While criticizing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Lagarde has emerged as a major fan of the concept of the central bank digital currency (CBDC).
