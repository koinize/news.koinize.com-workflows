    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-welcomes-november-with-40-breach-ready-for-a-50-breakthrough/",
    "description": "The first day of November marked an eventful moment in the cryptocurrency market as altcoins surged vigorously, led by impressive gains of Solana. This rally in Solana&#8217;s value set the tone for a day where altcoins gained significant traction. (Concurrently, Bitcoin experienced a late rally, breaching the $35,500 mark. This unexpected surge in Bitcoin not only solidified its position but also contributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the market.) The day&#8217;s dynamic movements highlighted the growing influence of altcoins, particularly Solana, showcasing their capacity to drive market trends. This collective push underscored a major shift in the crypto landscape, suggesting a broader diversification of investment interest beyond Bitcoin.

Solana: Meteoric Rise And Resilience In The Crypto Market Solana&#8217;s recent strides in the market have been nothing short of spectacular, showcasing an astounding growth of over 80% in just a few short weeks. SOL demonstrated its bullish momentum by surging to approximately $42.30, as reported by Coingecko. With a circulating supply of 420 million SOL, Solana is valued at a market cap of around $17,685,464,775. Despite worries about its future following the bankruptcy of Alameda Research, a major investor in the Solana ecosystem, and Sam Bankman Fried&#8217;s FTX cryptocurrency exchange, Solana has surprised many observers by emerging as one of the best-performing assets, rising by more than 300% this year. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap at the beginning of November, the value of SOL experienced a notable increase over the course of the last 30 days. Specifically, SOL&#8217;s market valuationÂ rose from $9.80Â billion on October 2 to surpass $17Â billion on Wednesday, resulting in a substantial addition of approximately $6 billion to its overall capitalization. Against a backdrop of positive indicators and having already reached a critical milestone of $40, the cryptocurrency Solana is poised to attain a noteworthy valuation of $50. The current rising trajectory of SOL&#8217;s value, which has experienced a roughly twofold increase in the past month, establishes a solid basis for the anticipated milestone, lending credibility to its feasibility and potential imminence.

Meanwhile, according to a recent disclosure made by Nansen, a blockchain analytics company, it has come to light that wallets associated with the bankrupt FTX engaged in transactions involving a significant amount of digital assets, amounting to around $156 million.

Nansen&#8217;s report provides a comprehensive account of FTX&#8217;s action of unstaking almost 1.6 million SOL tokens, which were estimated to be worth around $57.6 million, on October 30th. These assets are presently kept in a staking wallet. The act of unstaking described here is a component of FTX&#8217;s money movement plan, which has resulted in a notable rise in the overall amount of SOL transferred, approaching the threshold of $90 million.
