MKR is up nearly 34% in the bi-weekly timeframe, but long-term investors are enjoying bigger rewards as the token is up 205% year-to-date, and currently trading a little above $1,800.

CCData‚Äôs 2023 Digital Asset Market Review reveals that the market entered 2024 with a big jump in important metrics, like assets under management (AUM) which increased by nearly 15%. The growth observed was last seen in 2022.¬† MKR market cap currently at $1.701 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Digital asset management companies also benefited heavily from this bullishness, with AUMs on companies like Grayscale, Bitwise, and Van Eck growing steadily as the year ended.
