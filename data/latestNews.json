    "description": "Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently commented on the future trajectory of Bitcoin. He also mentioned when the flagship crypto token could hit this particular price level.  Bitcoin To Rise To $150,000 This Year Lee mentioned during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $150,000 this year. His belief that BTC could rise to this price level is due to the fact that demand is improving with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds are known to have achieved significant success since launching, something which has positively impacted Bitcoin’s price.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Millionaire Takes A Shot At Cardano For Being A ‘Wannabe Ethereum’ – Details Lee alluded to the Bitcoin Halving as another factor that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000. He specifically noted how the crypto token’s supply is going to shrink once the Halving event takes place. Interestingly, industry expert Anthony Pompliano recently highlighted how the demand for BTC was outpacing its supply.  This trend is expected to continue once the Halving takes place, as the amount of BTC mined daily will drastically reduce. Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional investors are expected to keep stacking up the crypto token without any hesitation. Lee also noted that a monetary easing, which is expected this year, would be favorable for a risk asset like Bitcoin. With inflation cooling off, the Federal Reserve is projected to cut down on interest. This will no doubt provide a bullish narrative for Bitcoin as investors are expected to double down on their investment in the crypto token once this happens.  BTC Still Headed For $500,000 Tom Lee had predicted during an appeearnce on Squawk Box in January this year that BTC would rise to $500,000 in the next five years. He once again reaffirmed this prediction during his most recent appearance on CNBC. According to him, “Bitcoin is sound money, and it is proving to be useful,” which makes this price level attainable.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Begins Massive Recovery Trend, But Can These Factors Drive A Rally To $0.2? Elaborating on how Bitcoin is useful, he stated that the crypto token has been a great store of value and also a good risk asset. He added that BTC is “incredibly secure” as there has been an issue of any fraudulent entry on the blockchain since its inception. The same cannot be said of banking institutions, which Lee noted have a lot of fraudulent transactions.  When quizzed about how Bitcoin is used for nefarious activities, he highlighted how the Dollar is used for a large percentage of crimes that take place, and no one questions its utility. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $51,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  BTC price at $51,900 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"
