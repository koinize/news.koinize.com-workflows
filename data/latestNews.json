It was co-authored by Connext’s founder Arjun Bhuptani. At the time, Bhuptani said it would help to minimize losses from bridge hacks by acting on the principle that “Token issuers are the ones who get rekt when bridges get hacked.”</p><p>Instead of each bridge issuing its own version of a token on every network, the new standard would allow bridges to mint “official” or “canonical” versions of each token. However, they can only do this with the permission of the token issuer, and this permission would be enforced through smart contracts. Token issuers would also be able to limit the number of coins that a particular bridge could mint, the proposal stated.</p><p>Under EIP-7281, bridges could still mint their own versions of tokens, but such derivative coins would not be considered “canonical” versions. As a result, consumers would eventually come to reject unofficial versions of coins. In Bhuptani’s view, this would lead to a safer DeFi space because it would put the responsibility for avoiding bridge hacks squarely on the shoulders of each token issuer, which would help to prevent end users from suffering losses.</p><p>To become an official part of the Ethereum ecosystem, an EIP has to be approved by EIP editors, a process that can take months. The July 24 announcement said the standard will now be implemented in Connext and Alchemix ahead of its official approval, allowing end users to rely on it immediately.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-was-a-big-blow-says-andre-cronje-as-fantom-tvl-slumps\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/multichain-was-a-big-blow-says-andre-cronje-as-fantom-tvl-slumps/amp\"><strong>Multichain bridge hack was a “big blow” to Fantom ecosystem, says Cronje</strong></a></em></p><p>In the announcement, Connext stated that the token standard will be “forward compatible” with the official version should it eventually be approved by the EIP editors. Bhuptani argued that the new implementation will prevent bridges with bad security or excessive centralization from being taken seriously, stating:</p><blockquote>“This approach [...] encourages open competition and innovation as token issuers now have the flexibility [to] granularly update their preferences for supported bridges over time. Instead of prioritizing building a monopoly on liquidity, or trying to corner market share by locking-in token issuers (or in some cases entire chains), bridges are now forced to have an ongoing focus on their security and quality of service, lest they be delisted.\"</blockquote><p>The issue of bridge security has become a hot topic in the crypto community.

While the gains are impressive, the real question is: Can the cryptocurrency sustain its current trajectory, or were short-term factors behind the price pump?</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/cca7db18-6148-46ec-a4b7-03cdbf74c075.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Average Maker (MKR) price at Coinbase, Binance and Bybit.

Dubbed “Endgame,\" <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-publishes-5-phase-roadmap-featuring-funding-for-open-source-ai-projects\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-publishes-5-phase-roadmap-featuring-funding-for-open-source-ai-projects/amp\">the upgrade plan</a> includes a new blockchain, a rebrand and the introduction of two tokens featuring updated functionalities.</p><p>Rune Christensen, co-founder of MarkerDAO, revealed that the primary component of “Endgame” entails developing incentive programs for interactions and governance participation based on a new chain bridged to the Ethereum network. Essentially, users will have the capacity to initiate hard forks in response to power attacks or abuse.</p><p>Ascribing the recent rally solely to these proposed changes seems simplistic, given that Maker’s price remained stable for 30 days after the announcement. Consequently, investors seeking to understand MKR’s movement must delve deeper to identify the precise triggers behind the price surge.</p><h2>Venture capital funds unload MKR</h2><p>According to crypto markets and decentralized finance analyst Nay, Paradigm Capital likely divested a significant portion of its MKR investments in March. Furthermore, A16z, another major venture capital firm that previously invested in Maker, has been reducing its position over recent weeks.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/ The last two US-based VCs have capitulated.<br><br>Paradigm unloaded their bags 4 months ago, and a16z is in the process of liquidating right now.

The smart contract then issues DAI, allowing borrowers to use it freely.</p><p>The previous smart burn mechanism involved burning DAI when a CDP closed. However, this posed a challenge if numerous CDPs closed simultaneously, leading to a DAI shortage.</p><p>Conversely, the new smart burn mechanism involves purchasing MKR from the market and burning it, independent of CDP closures. This allows MakerDAO to respond to market changes effectively and results in a reduced MKR supply, positively impacting its price.</p><h2>Real-world assets boost protocol revenue</h2><p>MakerDAO has impressively increased its earnings by 343% in three months by reducing reliance on the USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>) stablecoin and incorporating yield-generating real-world assets, according to MakerBurn data. This shift involved reducing the stablecoin ratio from 62.4% to 20.2% over three months.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/bb915bdb-39c7-46f1-b4a7-a7df0ce9d87c.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MakerDAO annual profit estimate in dollars.

Additionally, the co-founder’s reinforcement of commitment by adjusting his holdings in favor of MKR adds confidence to its future prospects.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-maker-mkr-hint-at-further-price-upside&utm_source=cointelegraph_com&utm_medium=appendix&utm_campaign=articles\" data-amp=\"https://mint-cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-maker-mkr-hint-at-further-price-upside&utm_source=cointelegraph_com&utm_medium=appendix&utm_campaign=articles/amp\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The ease of transition, familiarity and the fact they didn’t need to learn new tech was enough to stop them from thinking: “Why even choose between the bad and the worse?”</p><p>As we happily hopped platforms, taking data from one multibillionaire and handing it to another, we missed the real issue. Twitter CEO Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are the winners, but the users keep losing.</p><p>The costs Threads users are bearing to facilitate the transition amounts to billions of dollars. But they choose to do so with a clueless enthusiasm of abandoning the platform where users pay for verification and deal with limits on the number of posts they can read. “Stick it to the man” (by giving in to another one…). Who promised that Threads won’t impose the same practices, forcing users to either accept the social media big brother or move to yet another platform? Maybe it wouldn’t be all that bad.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-etf-isnt-bullish-for-bitcoin\"><strong><em>Don’t be naive — BlackRock’s ETF won’t be bullish for Bitcoin</em></strong></a></p><p>Teams behind blockchain-based social media and decentralized identities slept through an opportunity to work together and change how social networking approaches verification alongside profile and data ownership. With only recent promises to create a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/deso-offers-1m-bounty-for-building-decentralized-reddit\">decentralized version of Reddit</a>, we are too late on education and infrastructure to house the homeless Twitter outcasts. There is nothing left than to accept the easy, accessible Threads. But what exactly are we losing?</p><h2>Profile portability and data management</h2><p>Should you be able to be the same you, no matter what platform and provider you’re using?</p><p>Decentralized ID, or self-sovereign identity, is a form of identification or a digital profile. But in contrast to centralized accounts, the profiles, and related data, remain under users’ control. It’s like having a Google or Facebook account, using it to log into various applications and sites without being dependent on Google or Facebook as the sole providers and entities storing your data.</p><p>If Twitter and Threads used decentralized IDs, moving from one platform to another would be as easy as plugging your USB stick (remember those?) into a new laptop. But it isn’t like this. Why? Zuckerberg thrives on data sales. Twitter doesn’t monetize data to the same degree, but naturally, it does not want to give its data or users to a competitor.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/8d077fbb-d3fe-49bd-9e61-5d45016a30b4.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Twitter users worldwide, 2019-2024. Source: Statista</em></figcaption></figure><p>Self-sovereign identity means no data unless users consciously hand it to you. But most won’t do so without getting paid for the value they’re providing. Twitter and Threads don’t want to be losers. As long as they dominate the news space, they’re giving the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-blockchain-based-social-media-platforms-to-know\">alternative solutions</a> no chance of getting through. They remain the winners.</p><p>The transition of a large proportion of the Twitter community to Threads required a complete restart and setting up a profile without prior verification, which also led to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-twitter-impersonated-on-threads-by-possible-scammers\">scams and liabilities</a>. Within the Web3 community, which used Twitter as its prime medium of communication, scammers jumped at the opportunity, creating profiles of companies and influencers for their financial gain. Those users didn’t swap to Threads — was that their fault?</p><p>Should companies and influencers be forced to create placeholder Threads profiles as a precaution against imposters? In the Web2 world, yes. But had only Threads used self-sovereign identity, users could have easily verified whether the IDs used to create the new profiles were owned by companies and persons they claim to belong to.</p><h2>Community verification</h2><p>Another reason users are losing the Twitter and Threads battle is central authority. The often mysterious requirements to be verified and decisions regarding content bans lay in the centralized hands of the platforms’ teams led by their CEO. Decentralized social media offers an alternative.</p><p>Platforms that function as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-dao\">decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a> allow their communities to make decisions on community guidelines, such as how to deal with bots and whether or not to flag or ban fake news or troll content.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/time-for-the-sec-to-settle-with-coinbase-ripple\"><strong><em>It’s time for the SEC to settle with Coinbase and Ripple</em></strong></a></p><p>When decentralized IDs come into play, decentralized verification mechanisms will also emerge. With blockchain, you could offer users the opportunity to earn reputation points for being active in the community or sharing valuable content. They could earn leadership or governance roles and help navigate the platform as the social network grows. It’s an alternative to mysterious, centrally designed algorithms used by popular platforms.</p><p>The above sounds promising, right? So, how do we make it a reality?</p><p>The Twitter/Threads battle should be a wake-up call for projects working on decentralized social media and decentralized ID providers to come together, enter partnerships and create self-sovereign, data appropriation-free alternatives to making the rich even richer. They must not only work on the tech but also show the public that there is another route. One of the ways to do so is by helping users see the value of their data, help them monetize it, and make it worth the platform-hopping cost. The network effects will do the rest, and users will become the real winners.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Caria Wei</strong> is the co-founder of Nuvo.

Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch before the midterm elections, when they were the chair and ranking member, respectively, of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The report unsurprisingly found that more regulation is needed. The agency has a framework for evaluating regulatory reform proposals developed in 2009.</p><p>The report pointed to crypto asset trading platforms and stablecoins as products that lack regulation, but it examined regulators’ policies and activities without straying into “turf war” controversies related to defining securities. Thus, it identified the spot markets for nonsecurity crypto assets as the center of a regulatory gap and stated:</p><blockquote>“By designating a federal regulator to provide comprehensive federal oversight of spot markets for nonsecurity crypto assets, Congress could mitigate financial stability risks and better ensure that users of the platforms receive protections.” </blockquote><p>Traditional assets in that category enjoy robust regulation, the report noted. Crypto assets are subject to limited oversight, such as from the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and through state money transmitter licensing. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-congress-agency-recommends-4-key-policy-options-for-blockchain\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/us-congress-agency-recommends-4-key-policy-options-for-blockchain/amp\">US Congress agency recommends 4 key policy options for blockchain</a></em></strong></p><p>Stablecoins need regulation regarding the composition of their reserves, auditing and disclosures, and redemption rights. The report said current regulation is a hodgepodge of measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and states that does not amount to “consistent and comprehensive prudential regulation and oversight.” </p><p>Decentralized finance is capable of being regulated in inverse relationship to the level of its decentralization, the GAO said. When an ecosystem is fully decentralized, there is no individual who can be identified as responsible for developing, operating or governing it. It may also span multiple regulatory jurisdictions in its operations. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain technology—like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cryptocurrency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cryptocurrency</a>—could offer faster, cheaper financial transactions. But recent price crashes & bankruptcies have raised concerns about gaps in federal regulations that could put consumers at risk.

The report noted that the Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council was tasked with leading an effort to  create a unified approach to crypto asset oversight by the March 2022 Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.</p><p>The report recommended that the seven pertinent regulatory agencies “jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism […] for collectively identifying risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and formulating a timely regulatory response.” Furthermore:</p><blockquote>“This mechanism could include formal planning documents that establish the frequency of meetings and processes for identifying risks and responding to them within agreed-upon time frames.”</blockquote><p>The National Credit Union Administration expressed agreement with that finding, while the others did not agree or disagree. The GAO is the country’s highest auditor. While its recommendations are not legally binding, the century-old agency’s findings carry considerable moral weight. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-regulation-sec-chair-gary-gensler-final-say/\">Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template>\n\n\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

However, things could change this week with a slew of key earnings reports and the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on July 26. The latter could also impact the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which is on a recovery path. </p><p>Could lower levels attract buyers in Bitcoin and select altcoins? Will the strength in the U.S. equities markets limit the downside in the cryptocurrency markets? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.</p><h2>S&P 500 Index price analysis</h2><p>The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from 4,578 on July 19, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are not dumping their positions as they anticipate the uptrend to continue.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/5f147db1-3b02-4893-8fd7-234ae84ec980.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SPX daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 4,471 and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command. If the price turns up from 4,513 or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that lower levels continue to attract buyers. </p><p>That will enhance the prospects of a break above 4,578. The index could then rally to 4,650 and eventually to 4,800.</p><p>This positive view will be negated if the price dives below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a fall to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 4,336.</p><h2>U.S. Dollar Index price analysis</h2><p>The U.S. Dollar Index turned up sharply on July 18 and rose back above the breakdown level of 100.82 on July 20. This suggests that the breakdown below 100.82 may have been a bear trap.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b801bb91-991a-4bbb-b1ca-7f14ae0a3a36.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DXY daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The price has reached the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price turns down sharply from it and plunges below 99.57, the downtrend may resume. The index may then crash to 97.50.</p><p>Instead, if the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are back in the game. The index may then climb to the 50-day SMA (102.66) and subsequently to the downtrend line.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin bulls again pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($29,957) on July 23, but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/3b8a93fb-afb9-49b7-8ad7-92c8cd402c54.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears are trying to pull and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could start a deeper correction toward $1,700. Such a fall will indicate that the pair may remain stuck inside the $1,626 to $2,000 range for a while longer. The price action inside the range is likely to be random and volatile.</p><p>If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. That may open the gates for a possible rally to $2,000. The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2,000 or below $1,626.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>After failing to sustain above $0.83 on July 19 and 20, XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) has turned down toward the 20-day EMA ($0.67). </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/198357cb-3d09-4c52-bdd9-861dbd9c5f45.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If bulls want to keep the uptrend intact, they will have to protect the 20-day EMA with vigor. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, the XRP/USDT pair may form a range in the near term. </p><p>The boundaries of the range could be $0.66 on the downside and $0.86 on the upside. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the overhead resistance of $0.86.</p><p>Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could attract further selling, and the pair may collapse to the breakout level of $0.56.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>The bulls failed to propel BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) above the 20-day EMA ($243) in the past few days. That attracted heavy selling by the bears, who are trying to sink the price below the support of the symmetrical triangle.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/cbeb80e9-6531-4b03-9a6b-9cb5f8e43209.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If they succeed, it will suggest that the uncertainty between the bulls and the bears has resolved in favor of the sellers. </p><p>The BNB/USDT pair could then drop to the critical support at $220. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls. If the price rebounds off $220 with strength, it will suggest that the pair may remain range bound for a while.</p><p>Another possibility is that the price bounces off the support line of the triangle. In that case, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. Buyers will have to shove the price above the triangle to signal a comeback.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis </h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day EMA ($0.31).</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/8d63fef2-caba-43bc-a957-3dc9d010a8e5.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the buyers or the sellers. This uncertainty will tilt in favor of the bears if the price slumps below $0.30. That could sink the price to the uptrend line.</p><p>Contrarily, if buyers drive the price above $0.33, it will suggest that bulls are back in the game. The ADA/USDT pair could then rise to the July 14 intraday high of $0.38. The bears are likely to defend this level with vigor.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whale-exchange-inflow-1-year-high\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whale-exchange-inflow-1-year-high/amp\"><em>Bitcoin whale exchange inflow share hits 1-year high — over 40%</em></a></strong></p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>The bears tried to pull Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) back below the breakout level of $0.07 on July 22, but the bulls held their ground.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e2690ac3-c6ab-4c85-92af-d072d6f67877.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA ($0.07) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is a minor resistance at $0.08, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.</p><p>If buyers do not allow the price to skid below the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally to $0.10 increases. This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price declines and sustains below $0.07.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) continues to witness profit booking by short-term traders. That pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($23.73) on July 24.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/fec89ee5-badf-40a0-8cd8-33358267e160.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls will try to arrest the downward move at $22.30. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $27.12. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair may retest the July 14 high of $32.13.</p><p>On the other hand, if the price dives below $22.30, it will suggest that the break above $27.12 may have been a bull trap. The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($19.80). Such a move will suggest that the pair may continue to swing inside the large range between $14 and $27.12 for some more time.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($0.74) for the past few days. This shows that the bulls are protecting the level, but they have failed to start a recovery. This indicates that the bears are maintaining their pressure.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/4e3a7e2a-fbe8-46c1-b804-261f5866ad03.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has descended below 50, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium could tilt in favor of the bears if the price plummets below the 50-day SMA. The MATIC/USDT pair could then slide to $0.60.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $0.80, it will signal solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then retest the local high at $0.89. A break above this level could indicate the resumption of the uptrend.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Instead of processing binaries, these systems send signals across varying patterns of neurons with the added factor of time.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9C3kJE7G-Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The reason this is important for the fields of blockchain and AI, specifically, is because neuromorphic computers are fundamentally suited for pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. </p><p>Binary systems use boolean algebra to compute. For this reason, classical computers remain unchallenged when it comes to crunching numbers. However, when it comes to pattern recognition, especially when the data is noisy or missing information, these systems struggle. </p><p>This is why it takes a significant amount of time for classical systems to solve complex cryptography puzzles and why they’re entirely unsuited for situations where incomplete data prevents a math-based solution. </p><p>In the finance, AI and transportation sectors, for example, there’s a neverending influx of real-time data. Classical computers struggle with occluded problems — the challenge of driverless cars, for example, has so far proven difficult to reduce to a series of “true/false” compute problems. </p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KBOf7NJh4Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>However, neuromorphic computers are built for dealing with problems that involve a lack of information. In the transportation industry, it’s impossible for a classical computer to predict the flow of traffic because there are too many independent variables. A neuromorphic computer can constantly react to real-time data because it doesn’t process data points one at a time. </p><p>Instead, neuromorphic computers run data through pattern configurations that function somewhat like the human brain. Human brains flash specific patterns in relation to specific neural functions, and both the patterns and the functions can <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0961-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">change</a> over time. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-does-quantum-computing-impact-the-finance-industry\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/explained/how-does-quantum-computing-impact-the-finance-industry/amp\"><strong><em>How does quantum computing impact the finance industry?</em></strong></a></p><p>The main benefit of neuromorphic computing is that, relative to classical and quantum computing, its level of power <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00184-y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">consumption</a> is extremely low.

    "description": "<p>Ripple&rsquo;s CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC, accusing it of creating a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; by declaring itself the &ldquo;cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter today to defend Judge Torres&rsquo; recent decision, which declared that Ripple&rsquo;s sale of its XRP token did not constitute a sale of securities.</p>\n<p>Ripple&rsquo;s chief further blamed the SEC for creating the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; surrounding crypto regulation when it had no right to do so.</p>\nGarlinghouse Speaks Out Against SEC\n<p>Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory against the SEC has been celebrated by most of the industry but has seen some backlash from the naysayers. Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 the XRP token, concerning retail sales on digital asset exchanges, is not necessarily a security. Torres, however, did rule that XRP qualifies as a security under the Howey Test when sold to institutional investors.</p>\n<p>At the time of the ruling, Garlinghouse commented that institutional sale represents &ldquo;the smallest piece&rdquo; of the suit and believes if the SEC decides to appeal the decision regarding retail sales, it would only &ldquo;solidify&rdquo; Torres&rsquo; decision. Garlinghouse further labelled the SEC a &ldquo;bully&rdquo; for targeting &ldquo;weak players&rdquo; in the industry without the necessary resources to build a strong defence.</p>\n<p>The Ripple CEO continued his criticism of the agency in defence to retail consumers. He said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where&rsquo;s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In the same thread, Garlinghouse defended Judge Torres&rsquo; application of the law, emphasizing &ldquo;legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way to provide clear rules and protect retail.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">It&rsquo;s absurd to blame a Judge for faithfully applying the law. We all know legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail. Glad to see more members of Congress like @RepRitchie, @PatrickMcHenry champion this.</p>\n&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 22, 2023\n<p>\n\n</p>\nSEC May Appeal Decision But Will Take Years\n<p>While it has not clearly stated it would appeal Torres&rsquo; ruling, the SEC did hint at the possibility.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder, Do Kwon is trying to use the landmark ruling as precedence in his own battle against the securities agency. In a motion involving Kwon, the SEC urged the presiding judge not to seek guidance from the Ripple ruling. The SEC said Judge Torres&rsquo; decision &ldquo;adds baseless requirements&rdquo; to the Howey Test and stated there would be a &ldquo;further review&rdquo; of the ruling.</p>\n<p>Prominent crypto and pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton clarified the implications of a possible appeal by the SEC.</p>\n<p>Deaton said on Twitter that he does not view a potential appeal as a setback to the industry.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">An appeal is not even close to be a setback. First, it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it&rsquo;s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then - at least in the 2nd Circuit. Second, even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong&hellip; https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ</p>\n&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 22, 2023\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p>Mr Deaton explained that a possible SEC appeal would take at least two years to come to fruition and said that until such a decision is revealed, Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling remains the law.</p>\n<p>He assured nervous XRP holders,</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone underestimate how significant this win is.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-critical-support-level-can-it-hold-29250-before-monthly-candle-close/",
    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a sharp decline recently, mirroring the broader decline in the cryptocurrency market.  This has led to concerns among Bitcoin bulls, who closely monitor the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movements to determine whether the decline will continue or stabilize the market. Downside Volatility Threatens BTC’s Support According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hovering below a critical support level of $29,250. This is a crucial threshold for Bitcoin bulls, as a sustained breach of this level could trigger a macro trend shift and lead to a retest of lower support lines. Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin has over a week to continue holding this support level, with the July Monthly Candle Close as an essential milestone. However, the analyst also warns that there is plenty of time for the market to shake out investors with downside volatility below this level potentially. BTC currently trades at $29,000, with the $29,250 50-day Moving Average (MA) being momentarily lost. This aligns with Bitcoin&#8217;s squeeze momentum indicator, which points to a downtrend cycle. Historically, such cycles have resulted in a consolidation period of 15 to 30 days after a sharp decline like the one BTC experienced recently. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits However, there is positive news for bulls as BTC&#8217;s Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator is spiking, suggesting a loss of momentum in the current downtrend.  Nonetheless, if the current downtrend persists, the only notable support lines would be at $28,200, $28,100, $27,200, and the 200-day MA, which is critical for Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term trend and currently at $26,800. Bulls need to hold the 200-day MA, as losing it could compromise the current bullish trend.  Bitcoin On The Edge On the other hand, the broader cryptocurrency market is under pressure ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s upcoming interest rate decision. However, according to the crypto trader known as The Wolf Of Few Streets, Bitcoin&#8217;s support levels at 28,800 and 28,300 should prevent a significant fall.  The trader believes that the Bitcoin market has already priced in the expected increase. Ideally, the market should bounce off one of these levels and test $32,000 again after the interest rate data is released on Wednesday. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Additionally, The Wolf Of Few Streets is optimistic about the positive news that may emerge regarding Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) decisions, which could further support the market. The trader sees no immediate negatives for BTC and believes that a minor liquidation of long positions has been long overdue, making the timing for a decline perfect. However, The Wolf Of Few Streets does not expect this decline to last long. Overall, The Wolf Of Few Streets remains bullish on Bitcoin and believes the current market pressure is temporary. The trader&#8217;s analysis suggests that the support levels will hold, and positive news regarding ETF decisions could provide further support.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/aave/aave-may-rally-20-supported-by-historical-levels-but-crucial-resistance-remains/",
    "description": "Aave&#8217;s price surged to $88 just two weeks ago, but currently, the altcoin is experiencing a correction. Over the past 24 hours, Aave has dropped over 4%, and on the weekly chart, it has depreciated more than 7%. The technical outlook for Aave appears bearish, with both demand and accumulation declining on the one-day chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Presently, Aave is hovering near a critical support level, and upcoming trading sessions will be decisive in determining the coin&#8217;s direction. Although the price is currently above the crucial support zone, it faces two important resistance levels that it must overcome. Failure to surpass the immediate resistance could lead to a resurgence of bearish sentiment, potentially pushing the price below the local support level. Additionally, Aave&#8217;s market capitalization has declined, indicating a gradual loss of buyer momentum on the daily chart. Aave Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of press time, the altcoin&#8217;s value stands at $70, following a correction from its previous $88 peak. The coin encounters resistance levels at $72 and $75. It is important to note that if the price drops from its current level, sellers could become active. This is due to the presence of a bearish order block, signifying high sell volume. Failing to maintain a price above $68 may result in Aave trading near $66 and $64. However, historically, the $68 price mark has proven to be a crucial rallying point, as evidenced by the previous rally to $88, which was initiated from the same level. However, if the coin can maintain its price above the $68 level in the upcoming trading sessions, it may have the potential for a 27% rally opportunity. Technical Outlook Following the rejection at the $75 level, Aave&#8217;s buyers have been encountering difficulties in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also signalled this weakening buying strength as it dipped below the half-line. Additionally, the price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating a shift away from buyer-driven momentum. To revive buyer interest, Aave would need to break above the $72 mark, potentially drawing them back into the market. The altcoin showed sell signals in line with declining demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was negative, displaying red histograms, which are associated with sell signals on the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Could Restart Rally To $300 If It Breaks This Resistance Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator of capital inflows and outflows, was below the half-line, indicating that at the time of writing, capital outflows exceeded inflows.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunge-to-29200-sends-5-9-of-supply-into-loss/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows an additional 5.9% of the total Bitcoin supply has entered into losses as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has plummeted to $29,200 today. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Has Declined To 70.4% After Today&#8217;s Price Plunge According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 1.11 million BTC has gone underwater with the latest asset value drop. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;percent supply in profit,&#8221; which tells us about the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply currently carrying some profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Could Restart Rally To $300 If It Breaks This Resistance This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was previously moved at on the network. If this last transfer price for any coin were less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin would be holding an unrealized gain currently. The percent supply in profit adds up all such coins and calculates what part of the total supply they make up for. A counterpart indicator called the &#8220;percent supply in loss&#8221; keeps track of the opposite type of tokens, and its value can be simply found by subtracting the supply in profit from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin percent supply in profit over the past day or so: The value of the indicator seems to have taken a hit in recent hours &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit had been floating around 76.3% when the cryptocurrency price was above $30,200 yesterday. With the plunge to $29,200 over the past day, though, the metric has also taken a sharp hit, as only 70.4% of the total circulating supply is holding some unrealized profit now. Historically, whenever the profit in supply has crossed the 75% mark, declines in the price have become more probable. This is because investors become more likely to sell the more profits they hold. The latest tumble in the asset may have come because of this, as the investors who had been sitting on profits may have buckled and sold their coins to harvest their gains. As the metric has cooled down well below the 75% mark now, it&#8217;s possible that this may be it for the correction. Before the plunge to $29,200, Bitcoin had been consolidating above $30,000 since many weeks ago.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/russian-introduces-a-third-form-of-currency-as-putin-signs-digital-ruble-into-law/",
    "description": "Russia is progressing with its central bank digital currency (CBDC). President Vladimir Putin has endorsed the digital ruble bill, signing it into law on July 24. As a result of this approval, the digital ruble law is officially set to take effect starting from August 1, 2023. Related Reading: XRP Position In The Crypto Top 4 Ranking: Can It Endure? The digital ruble will serve as an additional form of the Russian national currency. It will run alongside the existing cash and non-cash forms. This development means that the Russian ruble will exist in three different forms. This includes physical cash, non-cash transactions (such as electronic transfers and online payments), and the newly introduced digital version. The digital ruble will primarily function as a medium for payments and transfers. However, opening a bank account using digital rubles or obtaining a loan denominated in digital rubles will not be possible. The recently passed legislation now grants the Russian central bank the authority to conduct the first CBDC pilot involving real consumers. Earlier, the government had planned to initiate trials in April. It was to collaborate with multiple local banks, including major institutions like Sberbank. Russia&#8217;s Central Bank To Be The Principal Operator Of Digital Ruble According to the newly enacted law, Russia&#8217;s central bank will assume the role of the principal operator for the digital ruble infrastructure. It will be responsible for safeguarding the stored assets. Additionally, individuals or entities not operators or participants in the digital ruble platform, are prohibited from using the phrase &#8220;digital ruble platform&#8221; for their benefit. This also includes banning any related words and expressions in their advertising. Elvira Nabiullina, the Bank of Russia governor, has stated that Russian citizens will not be obligated to use the CBDC. The usage of the digital ruble will be entirely voluntary. The decision to adopt the CBDC will rest with the individuals. Nabiullina stated: No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble [&#8230;] But we really hope that it will be more convenient and cheaper for both people and businesses, and they will start using it. This is a new opportunity. Provisions For The Inheritance Of Digital Rubles The document outlines provisions for the inheritance of digital rubles. It allows individuals to pass on their rights to these digital assets through testamentary dispositions or wills. The Russian government will establish the process and rules for issuing such orders in collaboration with the Bank of Russia. This ensures that digital rubles can be transferred or inherited according to the legal framework set by the authorities. It allows for adequately managing and distributing these digital assets during a person&#8217;s passing.

    "description": "Elon Musk is, once again, showing his support for Dogecoin in a subtle but meaningful way. Twitter, one of the biggest social media companies now under the leadership of Musk, recently changed its logo from the infamous ‘blue bird’ to a seemingly discrete X symbol. However, this was not the end of the changes as Musk also changed his Twitter bio to display the Dogecoin symbol.  Elon Musk Highlights Dogecoin In Recent Changes On Monday, Elon Musk changed his Twitter location to “XÐ&#8221;, X for the new Twitter logo, and Ð for Dogecoin&#8217;s logo, sparking speculations about a possible integration of Dogecoin into the Twitter platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Address Dormant For More Than 11 Years Moves $31 Million In BTC This isn’t the first time Musk has promoted DOGE and caused a stir in the crypto community, as he has tweeted about the meme coin several times in the past. With almost 150 million followers on the social media platform, Musk&#8217;s tweets garner a huge amount of attention. So when he mentions specific companies or cryptocurrencies, it often leads to big price swings.  Musk changes profile to include DOGE symbol &#124; Source: Twitter His tweets in the past have triggered double-digit percentage increases in the price of Dogecoin in particular. This time, Musk’s support seems to have had more of a subtle price reaction.  Following the implementation of the new bio, the price of Dogecoin shot up more than 5%. Trading volume on exchanges also increased drastically as investors rushed to buy the altcoin. According to Coinmarketcap, Dogecoin has seen a total increase of 309.19% in trading volume in the past 24 hours.  Dogecoin was created as a &#8220;meme currency,&#8221; but has since developed its own very passionate community and following, including Elon Musk, who is one of the world&#8217;s richest men. Will The New Twitter X Support DOGE? There’s a good chance that Twitter (now X) may incorporate Dogecoin payments into its platform, especially given Musk’s continuous support. As Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk could push for the social media company to incorporate the meme coin into its ecosystem. This will enable users to seamlessly make payments on the site using Dogecoin, which may attract more crypto investors to the platform and boost user engagement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap However, there are a few roadblocks in the way. More stable cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum are starting to be accepted as payment methods in various aspects of the world. However, altcoins like Dogecoin are still very volatile with little utility and there are questions about its stability before Twitter (X) seriously considers it as an official payment method. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.07535, a quick increase from its price of $0.07081 earlier in the day.

This listing has garnered immense attention from the global crypto community, with investors eager to participate in this new venture. The listing, announced today at 12:00 will include trading pairs such as WLD/BTC, WLD/USDT, and WLD/USDC. Worldcoin (WLD) aims to empower humanity in the Age of AI Worldcoin and revolutionize the digital identity landscape in the era of artificial intelligence. As the project&#8217;s service token, the WLD token carries essential governance features. This ambitious endeavor introduces the World ID system, Orb with iris scanner, and World App wallets.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap Despite privacy and security concerns expressed by experts, Altman is confident that Worldcoin&#8217;s open-source AI technology with iris scanning capabilities will alleviate these concerns over time.  Crypto Exchanges Line Up To List Worldcoin’s Newly Launched WLD Token Binance is not the only cryptocurrency exchange to participate in the listing of Worldcoin&#8217;s newly launched WLD token. Several other major exchanges, including OKX, Huobi, Bybit, and Gate.io, have also jumped on board to offer trading services for WLD. These listings have given a bullish birth to the newbie token (WLD). The token&#8217;s early trading on ByBit saw a remarkable surge, reaching highs of $2.79 within minutes of its debut. With a total token supply of 10 billion tokens, the WLD token&#8217;s fully diluted value currently stands at an alarming $25.6 billion.

The World ID system, authenticated through iris scanning technology called &#8220;The Orb,&#8221; aims to establish a trustable and reliable global identification system for all individuals. With financial backing of $115 million from its Series C funding round, the project is expected to make significant strides toward achieving its goals. The World ID&#8217;s potential to distinguish between real humans and AI-generated entities has caught the attention of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who is confident in its bright future. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Address Dormant For More Than 11 Years Moves $31 Million In BTC “At no time should a corporation or state own any part of the global financial system,” Dorsey said in response to a tweet from the Worldcoin Twitter account.
