According to Blowfish, the drainers’ script is available for a fee in marketplaces offering scam-as-a-service tools. </p><p>The Blowfish team broke down the drainers’ method to flip data and steal funds. “On Solana, a dApp can be given authority to submit a transaction. If the dApp’s onchain program includes a conditional that allows it to send the user SOL or drain their account, a drainer could flip that conditional at any time,” reads the analysis.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/scam-as-a-service-new-solana-drainers-identified\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
