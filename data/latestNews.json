    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-sell-signal-analyst-predicts-targets/",
    "description": "A Dogecoin sell signal has appeared on the weekly price chart. According to an analyst, here are the targets the coin could potentially dip to. Dogecoin Has Observed A TD Sequential Sell Signal Recently As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, TD Sequential has flagged a sell signal for DOGE. The &#8220;Tom Demark (TD) Sequential&#8221; here refers to an indicator in technical analysis that&#8217;s popularly used for finding points of probable tops and bottoms in any asset&#8217;s price. There are two phases involved in this metric. During the first, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine, and at the end of these nine candles is a potential reversal point for the asset. This phase is called the &#8220;setup.&#8221; If the candles leading to the setup&#8217;s completion were green, then the TD Sequential would give a sell signal for the chart. On the other hand, if they were red, the signal would be a buy one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rushes To Exchanges, But This Sign Remains Positive For The Bulls The other phase is the &#8220;countdown,&#8221; which kicks off as soon as the setup is complete. This phase is thirteen candles long; at the end of these thirteen, another probable top or bottom occurs for the price. Dogecoin has seen its weekly price complete a TD Sequential setup recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that highlights this pattern in the memecoin. Looks like the asset has recently seen nine green candles &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the TD Sequential has completed the setup phase on the weekly chart of Dogecoin with green candles recently. This could indicate that the coin may reverse towards a downtrend from here on out. &#8220;This comes as DOGE faces a key resistance level that has repeatedly thwarted its climbs in the past,&#8221; explains Ali. &#8220;A correction could see prices dip to $0.085 or even $0.078.&#8221; The former target would mean a decrease of about 11% from the current cryptocurrency price, while the latter would suggest a drawdown of more than 18%. Not all hope may be lost for Dogecoin, though, as the analyst notes, &#8220;if DOGE can surge past $0.11, the bearish scenario gets negated.&#8221; A few days ago, Ali also shared this chart that showed the on-chain support and resistance map of the memecoin: The cost basis distribution of the asset &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X In on-chain analysis, support and resistance are defined based on the concentration of investors who bought at a particular level. Price ranges hosting the cost basis of many addresses provide strong support/resistance when the asset&#8217;s spot price retests them. Related Reading: Crypto Market Crashes: Traders React With “Buy The Dip” Calls The chart shows that the $0.094 to $0.097 range is the strongest support zone for the asset out of all the listed ranges. Dogecoin has declined into this zone recently, so it&#8217;s a test of whether on-chain support can hold against the technical sell signal that has recently formed. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.096, up 7% in the past week. The price of the asset appears to have seen a dip over the past couple of days &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

This comprehensive guide is designed to walk you through the journey of how to create a crypto token, from the initial concept to its final launch. Whether you are wondering how to create a DeFi token or how to create a meme token, or another type of digital asset, we cover all the essentials you need to know. We&#8217;ll delve into the specifics of each developmental phase, address how much does it cost to create a crypto token, legal aspects, and even provide insights on how to create a crypto token for free. With a focus on clarity and expert guidance, this guide is your doorway to successfully navigating the intricate process of crypto token creation. Basics: How To Create A Crypto Token Creating a crypto token is an intricate process that combines technical skills with a deep understanding of the blockchain ecosystem. This task requires not just programming prowess but also a strategic approach to ensure your token aligns with market needs and regulatory standards. The concept of a crypto token encompasses a digital asset built on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are native to their respective blockchains, tokens are created using the existing blockchain&#8217;s infrastructure. They represent various assets or utilities, from digital art and virtual real estate to governance rights within a decentralized network. Remarkably, the history of crypto tokens is marked by significant events, notably the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom around 2017. This period witnessed a surge in token creation, as startups and projects used ICOs to raise capital by issuing tokens. While this led to groundbreaking innovations, it also attracted scrutiny due to the prevalence of scams and lack of regulation. A recent success story in the crypto token space is PEPE coin, launched on April 16, 2023. It quickly gained popularity, notably among memecoin enthusiasts. PEPE coin, developed as a tribute to the meme character Pepe the Frog, reached a market cap of $1.61 billion in less than three weeks after its launch. Step-by-Guide: How To Create A Token Creating a crypto token is a complex process, requiring a blend of technical expertise and strategic planning. Here&#8217;s a more detailed guide on “how to create a crypto token”: #1 Specify The Purpose Of Your Token The purpose of your token is foundational. Are you creating a utility token to facilitate transactions within a specific ecosystem, a security token to represent digital shares of an asset, or a governance token to allow holder participation in decision-making? Understanding and clearly defining the utility, target audience, and problem your token addresses is critical for its relevance and success. #2 Choose A Blockchain Your choice of blockchain affects the token&#8217;s functionality, scalability, and security. Consider Ethereum for its well-established infrastructure and strong support for ERC-20 tokens. Other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Cardano offer different advantages like lower transaction fees or enhanced scalability. Assess the community support, development tools, and consensus mechanisms of each blockchain to find the best fit for your token. #3 Create A Whitepaper A whitepaper is crucial for gaining trust and interest. It should comprehensively detail your token&#8217;s purpose, technology, governance model, and economic mechanics. Include technical details, projected use cases, and a clear roadmap. A good whitepaper is transparent about the token&#8217;s features, risks, and long-term vision, helping to establish credibility among potential investors and users. #4 Set Up A Node Setting up a node on the Ethereum network is a critical step for anyone looking to create a token. This process is essential because it ensures direct and reliable access to the blockchain. By operating a node, creators maintain a personal copy of the entire Ethereum ledger, allowing for real-time tracking of transactions and network activity. This direct connection to the Ethereum network not only enhances security but also provides greater control over the transactions associated with the token. #5 Develop Smart Contracts And Test Them Smart contracts are the core of your token&#8217;s functionality on the blockchain. They must be coded carefully to manage the token&#8217;s operations securely and efficiently. Post-development, testing these contracts on a testnet is vital to identify and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring reliability and security. This stage may involve multiple iterations to refine the contract&#8217;s functionality. #6 Deploy On Mainnet Deploying your token on the mainnet brings it to life. This step requires precision and often a fee, known as gas in Ethereum. Ensure your smart contracts are thoroughly tested before this step, as deploying on the mainnet makes the contracts immutable and any errors irreversible. #7 Distribute And Market Develop a strategy for distributing your token. This might involve initial offerings like ICOs, airdrops to potential users, or partnerships with exchanges for listing. Marketing is key to building awareness and credibility. Utilize social media, community engagement, and partnerships to spread the word about your token and its use cases. #8 Maintain And Update Post-launch, it&#8217;s essential to maintain your token&#8217;s ecosystem. This includes monitoring the token&#8217;s performance, updating smart contracts as needed, and responding to community feedback. Regular updates and improvements will help maintain the token&#8217;s relevance and value in a rapidly evolving market. Coding Necessary?
