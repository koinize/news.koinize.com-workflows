Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Why is the crypto market down?</h2><p>The recent decline in the crypto market can be attributed to several factors, as explained below.</p><h3>\"Overbought\" correction</h3><p>The crypto market's recent decline occurred largely due to its excessively overbought conditions.</p><p>Notably, all the major cryptocurrencies witnessed their daily relative strength index (RSI) indicator crossing and staying above 70, which is a bearish sign. Simply put, an overbought RSI dampens the buying demand for assets at their local highs, leading to pullbacks.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/0c9bb31f-f994-45e7-b68b-12f6318e376b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto market cap daily performance chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The crypto market had ignored its overbought RSI signals for a while, confirmed by its 27.85% rally between Oct. 22 and Nov. 13, shown above. The upside sentiment boomed due to optimism about a potential <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-etfs-a-beginners-guide-to-exchange-traded-funds\">Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval</a>.</p><p>However, this week, the euphoria is easing.</p><h3>Fake XRP ETF filing</h3><p>The decline in the crypto market is happening during a week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-window-sec-bloomberg-analysts\">review</a> some pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications</p><p>Notably, the securities regulator must decide on applications from Hashdex and Global X ETFs by Nov. 17. They also need to decide on Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF application by Nov. 21. Failing to do so would push the deadline to 2024.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/bfd2a18c-d68e-4924-a2cc-2ffa01f1a1ab.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Spot Bitcoin ETF deadlines. Source: Bloomberg</em></figcaption></figure><p>The market anticipates another delay, according to James Edwards, a crypto analyst at Australian fintech firm Finder. </p><p>The analyst <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-hoax-filing-spike-bad-look-wont-sway-sec-etf-decisions\">mentioned</a> a fake BlackRock XRP trust filing that caused <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/delaware-authorities-refer-fake-blackrock-xrp-trust-filing-to-state-s-justice-department\">extreme price swings in the XRP markets</a>. He believes this event will hurt the chances of launching a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. because it supports the SEC's claims of price manipulation in the crypto industry.</p><p>However, Bloomberg's James Seyffart <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1724469793422508533\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sees</a> the SEC's odds of approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF application by Jan. 10, 2024, at 90%. </p><p>So for now, traders are likely securing profits at the current, multi-month high prices in the crypto market because of this potentially long wait.</p><h3>Long liquidations </h3><p>The decline across major cryptocurrencies has led to a rush of liquidations across the derivative market. </p><p>For instance, the past 24 hours have witnessed $307.67 million worth of liquidations, out of which around $265 million are long positions. Crypto market prices are negatively affected when long derivative positions are liquidated without buying pressure from trading volume.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/b17d597f-e62a-4a9c-bb97-2fb7015220a4.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Is the crypto bull run over?</h2><p>The ongoing correction in the crypto market does not put an end to its year-long bull run.</p><p>Chart technicals suggest that the market is just moving up and down within an upward trending pattern. The recent drop in prices started after it reached the highest point of this trend, as shown below. Now, the market looks to find support near the 0.236 Fibonacci level of $1.24 trillion. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/eaddc2c3-45c7-4459-b92d-a16a78628228.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto market's weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the crypto market stabilizes around $1.24 trillion, then its likelihood of retesting the channel's upper trendline near $1.5 trillion is high. Conversely, a close below $1.24 trillion, will put the market at risk of falling toward the lower trendline support closer to $1 trillion. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bounces-cpi-inflation-slows-beyond-forecasts\">Bitcoin bounces at $36.2K lows as CPI inflation slows beyond forecasts</a></em></strong></p><p>The downside target coincides with the crypto market's 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave).</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
