    "description": "AVAX price rallied over 50% and traded above the $40 level. Avalanche is now correcting gains, but the bulls might remain active near the $32 support zone. AVAX price gained pace above the $30 and $40 levels against the US dollar. The price is trading above $30 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $35.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $35 and $30 support levels. AVAX Price Corrects Lower In the past few days, Avalanche’s AVAX saw a strong increase above the $25 resistance zone. It gained over 50% and broke many hurdles near $30. It even cleared the $40 level before the bears appeared. A new multi-month high was formed near $43.06 before the price started a downside correction, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a 15% drop and the price traded below the $38 level. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $21.24 swing low to the $43.06 high. AVAX price is still trading above $30 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $35.00 on the 4-hour chart of the AVAX/USD. Source: AVAXUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $38.00 zone. The next major resistance is forming near the $40.00 zone. If there is an upside break above the $38.00 and $40.00 levels, the price could surge over 10%. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily toward the $45 level. Dips Limited in Avalanche? If AVAX price fails to continue higher above the $38.00 or $40.00 levels, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the trend line at $35. The main support is near the $32.00 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $21.24 swing low to the $43.06 high. A downside break below the $32.00 level could open the doors for a major decline towards $18.80. The next major support is near the $26.50 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for AVAX/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for AVAX/USD is now below the 50 level.
