    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/dot/polkadot-road-to-recovery-will-4-mark-the-turning-point/",
    "description": "Polkadot (DOT) has been grappling with a descending resistance trendline, experiencing a relentless decline since February. In the month of October, the digital asset suffered a 10% drop, plummeting from $4.3 to $3.6.  Market analysts are warning of the potential for further losses should the prevailing bearish pressure persist. However, a slight glimmer of hope emerged as DOT attempted a reversal at $3.6, hinting at the possibility of overcoming the overhead resistance barrier. Related Reading: XRP On The Cusp Of Redemption? Unveiling Data-Backed Insights At present, the DOT price according to CoinGecko stands at $3.74, depicting a marginal 0.3% decline over the last 24 hours and a 2.8% dip over the span of seven days.  DOT&#8217;s Struggle For Recovery The absence of horizontal support below the current price underscores the significance of Fib retracement levels in forecasting potential bottoming areas. Notably, a Fibonacci retracement tool was utilized, encompassing the lower high of $4.8 on August 29 and the recent dip of $3.6 on October 12. This analysis highlighted that the path to recovery for DOT faces significant obstacles at the 23.6% Fib ($3.9) and the 38.2% Fib ($4). Complicating matters further, the $4 level, serving as the second resistance target, coincides with a daily bearish order block (OB). This confluence suggests that crossing the $3.9 threshold could prove challenging for bullish momentum. Polkadot Developers Stand Strong Despite the persistent price downturn, the developers within the Polkadot ecosystem remain resolute and undeterred. This unwavering commitment is evident from the substantial Polkadot active developers, which are currently hovering close to an all-time high. This figure notably exceeds the levels recorded in 2021 when the altcoin&#8217;s price reached its peak. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.06 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com In a recent announcement, Parity Technologies, a significant player in blockchain infrastructure, revealed its strategic shift towards decentralization within the Polkadot (DOT) ecosystem. The forthcoming organizational changes are anticipated to mark a new chapter for the company in the months to come. Polkadot&#8217;s Cutting-Edge Technology Advancement Amidst circulating rumors, Parity Technologies promptly dispelled speculations about a massive layoff of approximately 300 employees during a recent off-site gathering in Mallorca. The company emphasized that any adjustments to the workforce will be gradual and in alignment with its progressive decentralized strategy.

Emphasizing their dedication, Parity underscored their commitment to driving the advancement of Polkadot&#8217;s cutting-edge technology.
