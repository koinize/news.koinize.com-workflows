In the “upward” case, a stablecoin is sold by bad actors to money launderers at market price and then another stablecoin  can be repurchased by the bad actors at an inflated price, with the difference serving as payment for the laundering services.  </p><p>Illegal USDT transactions may price the stablecoin at 8-10 Chinese yuan (RMB), the report stated. At the time of writing, 7 RMB is trading for 0.98 United States dollars.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitrace-stablecoin-money-laundering-methods\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
