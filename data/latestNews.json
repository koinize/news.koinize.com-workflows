Five years later, he discovered hed been successful, but the foundation fell apart before he received any money.</p><p>Lopp also applied to work at Coinbase in 2015 and never even got an interview, but his work on Statoshi did land him a gig running the nodes for institutional custody and infrastructure provider BitGo.

Initially, he was on the big blocks side, <a href=\"https://blog.lopp.net/-de-centralized-block-chain-scaling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >writing</a> an article in 2015 calling for an increase in the 1MB size of blocks to increase capacity and suggesting blocks may one day hit 10GB. He also supported the Bitcoin XT fork of Bitcoin Core, which ended up part of Bitcoin Cash.<br><br>That was really a result of what I had been doing as an engineer for the past decade, he says, adding that hed spend much of each year prepping for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales because if you couldnt handle that, then it would be a bad user experience, you would lose customers, you would lose money, and the business would not grow as quickly. He didnt want Bitcoin to lose potential users through a bad experience with the slow, expensive blockchain.<br><br>However, his perspective started to change when he realized the impact bigger blocks would have on his own work at BitGo, writing services that talked to the nodes.<br><br>I started to see the opposite side of the argument, he explains. Even with these tiny 1MB blocks, it was quite challenging for me to write services that could ingest all of this blockchain data at a very fast pace.</p><p>It took weeks sometimes to get a new indexing service up and running from scratch, and doubling or tripling the block size would require exponentially more resources to the point where only the largest enterprises who had a lot of money to throw at this problem would even be able to run the nodes and the services on top of them.”</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/what-the-hell-is-web3-anyway/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>What the hell is Web3 anyway?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/can-p2e-gaming-grind-away-market-share-from-mainstream-games/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Blockchain games take on the mainstream: Heres how they can win</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>So, while Lopp ended up strongly supporting SegWit as a practical solution and thinks Bitcoin is superior to any other cryptocurrency as sound money, he also sees room for experimentation on other protocols, and on Bitcoin.</p><p>A lot of people get very ideological and, in some cases, puritanical about this stuff, he says.
