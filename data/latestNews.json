The exchange announced it banned Russian residents from using fiat currencies other than the ruble on its platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">On Monday, cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced introducing more restrictions for Russian users on its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform. Binance informed customers via its Telegram channel that it banned Russian residents from using fiat currencies other than the Russian ruble.&nbsp;</p>\nBinance Restricts Fiat Currency Transactions to Ruble \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">According to Binance, Russian users residing outside of Russia can no longer use currencies such as the ruble, the US dollar, the euro, or the Ukrainian hryvnia on the exchange. The exchange further stated that to use the Russian ruble on Binance P2P, users must have Russian KYC verification and reside within Russia simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">The exchange simply said to its Russian customers: </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">&ldquo;Users residing in Russia can trade on Binance P2P only in fiat currency in rubles. Any other fiat currencies are prohibited.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">Further stating,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">&ldquo;We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or need assistance regarding this update, please contact Binance Customer Support.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\nSanctions Impact Binance&rsquo;s Russian Operations \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">Many Russians have resorted to using crypto exchanges after sanctions from the West cut Russian banks off from the global payment network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">According to reports by the Wall Street Journal, Binance removed five Russian banks under US sanctions from its P2P platform after the US Treasury Department flagged peer-to-peer crypto transactions to evade sanctions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">Binance has been under intense regulatory scrutiny recently and is facing a reported probe for violating sanctions against Russia. In May, reports emerged that Binance Holdings was under investigation in the US for allegedly allowing customers based in Russia access to the exchange. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">&nbsp;In a newly published report by the WSJ, Binance is re-evaluating its Russian operations after the once-important market became an issue for the exchange. A spokesperson for Binance told the WSJ: </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">&ldquo;All options are on the table, including a full exit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\">&nbsp;Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bleak-sharks-whales-4-month-long-selloff/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows the Ethereum sharks and whales have continued to sell for four months now, a sign that the asset may not recover soon. Ethereum May Not Be In The Best Situation Right Now In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into how the various metrics related to Ethereum look like at the moment to get hints about the asset&#8217;s future outcome. First, the analytics firm has discussed the asset&#8217;s &#8220;transaction volume,&#8221; that is the daily total number of tokens that are being transferred on the network. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator: The value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum transaction volume has gone down recently and has hit some low levels, suggesting that the network isn&#8217;t observing much usage currently. &#8220;Though not necessarily a red flag for any asset, this is indicative of the crowd simply showing disinterest during a time when many traders really can&#8217;t decide whether the $1,650 price level is overvalued or undervalued,&#8221; explains Santiment. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year The firm further notes that the $1,500 level has had quite a bit of psychological support around it, so if the cryptocurrency declines toward this level, the volume might bounce back. While the volume can provide hints about the interest among the general investors, it may not necessarily reflect the sentiment of the largest of holders. So, the second indicator Santiment checked is the total amount of holdings belonging to investors carrying between 10 and 10,000 ETH in their wallets. Looks like the value of the indicator has been heading downhill since a while now &#124; Source: Santiment The investors with address balances in this range are the sharks and whales, entities that can carry some influence because of their large holdings. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that these cohorts as a whole have been continuously selling since around four months ago when ETH hit its top above $2,100. Prior to this, these large investors had been accumulating, but it would appear that these investors gave in to the allure of profit-taking once ETH rose to high enough levels. The selloff has slowed down a bit recently, but these holders are still continuing to shed a net portion of their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming? This Metric Could Suggest So &#8220;This continued tailslide in supply held by sharks and whales is something we need to monitor,&#8221; says the analytics firm. &#8220;Prices can still rise as they take profit, and their holdings are far from a perfect correlation. But in terms of a signal for an immediate return to $2K and above, it certainly isn&#8217;t being perpetuated by whales.&#8221; Finally, Santiment has looked into the &#8220;development activity&#8221; of the asset, to see how much work the developers have been putting into the project&#8217;s public GitHub repository. The trend in the development activity &#124; Source: Santiment Generally, this metric can be one of the things to look out for to see if a project has long-term potential or not. As the Ethereum developers haven&#8217;t stopped working hard recently, it&#8217;s safe to assume that they are still committed to the asset. So, at least this is one of the indicators not bleak for ETH right now. ETH Price Ethereum has been unable to break out of sideways movement recently as its price continues to trade around the $1,600 level. ETH has continued to be flat in the past few days &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView Featured image from Sebastian Pena Lambarri on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
