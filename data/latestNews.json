He originally minted his first NFT on March 26, 2021, on Foundation after a random account on X reached out because Wilson had made a joke campaign poster for comedian Eric Andre that went viral.</p><p>This dude reached out and just said, Hey, I have a Foundation invite. Would you want to mint a piece on there? I said I dont know what minting is. I dont know what Foundation is. I have no clue what any of this shit is, Diewiththemostlikes explains.</p><p>He said, It could be a good avenue for your digital art, so I said, Well, fuck it, man. Its not like Im not doing anything with it now. Its getting two likes on Instagram from fucking porn bots. So, whatever, Ill mint something, and maybe I can sell something finally as an artist  that would be nice. </p><p>It was a relatively slow start, but consistency and persistence positioned him well, and hes often received praise from other well-known artists such as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/digital-artist-osf-nft-creator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >OSF</a>. </p><p>Now knocking on the door of digital art stardom, diewiththemostlikes still hasnt come to grips with the position he finds himself in.</p><p>I still honestly cant really wrap my head around this shit thats going on. I just assumed I was gonna die alone doing something I hated. To be part of this kind of movement with all these other really insane artists who are on this crazy trajectory and who are constantly leveling up is really cool. Its pretty wild, he says.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"479\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/our-memories-were-beef-too-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"our memories were beef too by diewiththemostlikes\" class=\"wp-image-25582\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/our-memories-were-beef-too-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium.jpeg 479w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/our-memories-were-beef-too-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Our memories were beef too by Diewiththemostlikes.

Well, in classic die fashion, theres humor and an underlying meaning<em>.</em></p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Ive got the most common name to ever exist, Mark Wilson. When I was applying for apartments, people would think it was a scammer name because Mark Wilson is a super common name here in the States. They would do a background check and think I was a fake person. </p></blockquote><p>Im cool with my name… But diewiththemostlikes kind of came in, and its funny because its actually a really cumbersome name to say. A lot of people during interviews will ask what they even call me. Its a really long and kind of an unenjoyable name to say, but I suppose that I find comfort in that. Discomfort, if you will, or the inability to kind of determine what I should be called is awesome.</p><p>The name pokes fun at a world where we seek likes on social media for dopamine hits, which Wilson points out is a transactional existence.</p><p>Its a really interesting distillation of our transactional existence as a whole and kind of how fucking sad and depressing it can be in many ways. But also the beauty of it, obviously, none of us would be here; we wouldnt be talking here without Twitter. Certainly, my art wouldnt be doing what it was doing, or I wouldnt be able to impact anybody without a platform.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Big-Election-Day-by-diewiththemostlikes.png\" alt=\"Big!

Theres a story in every sagging ass of anyone walking around the fucking dregs of this country, he says. Within those kinds of nuanced little wrinkles, scabs and wounds is where I thrive and where I love to exist.</p><p>This lens on life and humanity is often exaggerated… If you look a little deeper on my pieces, theyre definitely documentarian but certainly grotesque at a very surface level.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/regarding-the-inhalation-of-failing-dreams-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"regarding the inhalation of failing dreams by diewiththemostlikes\" class=\"wp-image-25581\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/regarding-the-inhalation-of-failing-dreams-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium.jpeg 480w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/regarding-the-inhalation-of-failing-dreams-by-diewiththemostlikes-Medium-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Regarding the inhalation of failing dreams by Diewiththemostlikes.

Sublime satire</strong></h2><p>The tsunami of crypto X accounts posting gm led to a series of meat art. </p><p>Good meat originally arose out of a place of complete ridicule, which is where a lot of my art I feel like comes from. Its satire; its ridicule; its hilarity. I was really annoyed with the transactional state of everybody just saying gm, with nothing else to say. It was gm with a fucking coffee mug, and that was it. Then you just see gm, gm, gm, gm. It was just like, What the fuck are we all doing here? This is insane, dude, says Wilson.</p><p>So, then I kind of came up with good meat as a way to ridicule that, and I was posting art with the pieces originally, and then it kind of transitioned into now. Im just gonna post meat pictures now because that fits the kind of dull exchange. The dull morning exchange that we all participate in.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">good meat. <a href=\"https://t.co/XTAame5flz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/XTAame5flz</a></p>— die with the most likes (@toadswiback) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toadswiback/status/1724397210966605861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >November 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p>Its just like heres a big heaving pile of rotting meat.

Its been like 20,000 hours on the iPad and in my basement making canvases and acrylic.</p><p>Its just bludgeoning stuff out that I feel like has to come out or else itll rob me from the inside, so relentless and unflinching, I guess, are the two words that I would use.
