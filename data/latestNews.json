As of now, the SEC has not instructed the firms to withdraw their applications, a change from 2021 when firms<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vaneck-and-proshares-apply-to-withdraw-ethereum-etf-filings-from-sec\"> were instructed to withdraw similar applications</a>. This suggests that the regulator won't block the fund's launch within a few weeks, according to the WSJ sources</p><p>At least 16 applications for Ether or Bitcoin-Ether futures ETFs are awaiting regulatory approval. Ether is the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, used for peer-to-peer transactions within the decentralized network. A crypto futures ETF tracks the performance of crypto futures contracts. For example, instead of investing directly in Bitcoin or Ethereum, a crypto futures ETF invests in futures contracts that are tied to the price of these digital assets.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UPDATE: Here&#39;s what the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Ethereum</a> futures ETF filings race looks like.

Earlier this week, asset management firm Valkyrie <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-valkyrie-files-for-ether-futures-etf-with-the-sec\">filed for an Ether futures ETF</a> in addition to a previous application combining a Bitcoin-Ether futures strategy. Valkyrie is the first in line in this race, and could see its BTC-ETH ETF debuting in early October. </p><p>In the ETF industry, first-mover advantage is imperative. According to the WSJ citing data from Morningstar, the first futures Bitcoin ETF approved from ProShares, has gathered $1 billion in assets under management since its inception in October 2021, while Valkyrie's similar product, launched a few days later, amassed nearly $28 million in assets under management.</p><p>In another major decision affecting the crypto industry, the SEC has yet to decide whether it will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Players <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-decision-bitcoin-etfs-wont-leave-out-wall-street-giants\">waiting approval include Wall Street giants</a>, such as Fidelity and BlackRock. According to the application's timeline, the SEC has until January to deliver a final verdict. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/deposit-risk-crypto-exchanges-money/\"><strong><em>Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
