Dynamo Daos Patrick Scott dug up PayPal founder Peter Thiels thoughts on AI and crypto in his forward to the re-release of the 1997 non-fiction book <em>The Sovereign Individual, </em>which predicted cryptocurrency, among other things. In it, Thiel argues AI is a technology of control, while crypto is one of liberation.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“AI could theoretically make it possible to centrally control an entire economy.

In the demo, users write something like “make a game set in ancient ruins” and “add some trees,” and the AI does the rest. It’s still being developed and will be released at the end of this year or early next year.

This saves it from some hallucinations.”<br><br>Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Wired this week he has no regrets about not launching its chatbot early to beat ChatGPT because the tech “needed to mature a bit more before we put it in our products.”</p><p>“It’s not fully clear to me that it might have worked out as well,” Pichai said. “The fact is, we could do more after people had seen how it works. It really won’t matter in the next five to 10 years.”</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-meets-15-minute-cities\"><strong>AI meets 15-minute cities</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-can-already-design-better-cities-than-humans-study-shows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Researchers</a> at Tsinghua University in China have built an AI system that plans out cities in line with current thinking about walkable 15-minute cities that have lots of green space (please direct conspiracy theories about the topic to X).<br><br>The researchers found the AI was better at tedious computation and repetitive tasks and was able to complete in seconds what human planners required 50 to 100 minutes to work through. Overall, they determined it was able to improve on human designs by 50% when assessed on access to services, green spaces and traffic levels.</p><p>The headline figure is a bit misleading, though, as the finished plans only increased access to basic services by 12% and to parks by 5%. In a blind judging process, 100 urban planners preferred some of the AI designs by a clear margin but expressed no preference for other designs. The researchers envisage their AI working as an assistant doing the boring stuff while humans focus on more challenging and creative aspects.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-stephen-fry-is-cloned\"><strong>Stephen Fry is cloned</strong></h2><p><em>Blackadder </em>and <em>QI </em>star and much-loved British comedy institution Stephen Fry says he has become a victim of AI voice cloning.</p><p>On September 14, Fry played a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/09/harry-potter-uk-audiobooks-narrator-stephen-fry-warns-ai-ripoff-1235548993/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >clip</a> from a historical documentary he apparently narrated at the CogX Festival in London last week  but revealed the voice wasnt him at all. I said not one word of that  it was a machine, he said. They used my reading of the seven volumes of the Harry Potter books, and from that dataset an AI of my voice was created, and it made that new narration.<br><br>Training AI to rip off the work of actors and repurpose them elsewhere without payment is one of the key issues in the current actors and writers strike in Hollywood. Fry said the incident was just the tip of the iceberg, and AI will advance at a faster rate than any technology we have ever seen.

Source: CoinGlass</em></figcaption></figure><p>The open interest spiked to $12.1 billion while Bitcoin's price <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today\">concurrently increased</a> by 3.4%, the highest point in over two weeks at $27,430. </p><p>However, investors soon realized that, aside from a comment by the Binance.US auditor regarding the challenges of ensuring full collateralization, there was little concrete information revealed in the unsealed documents.</p><p>Later in the day, Federal Judge Zia Faruqui <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-fail-motion-compel-binance-us-software\">rejected the SEC's request to inspect Binance.US's</a> technical infrastructure and share additional information. Nevertheless, the judge stipulated that Binance.US must furnish more details about its custody solution, casting doubt on whether Binance International ultimately controls these assets.</p><p>By the end of Sep. 18, Bitcoin's open interest had receded to $11.3 billion as its price dropped by 2.4% to $26,770. This decline indicated that the entities behind the open interest surge were no longer inclined to maintain their positions. </p><p>These whales were likely disappointed with the court's outcomes, or the price action may not have unfolded as expected. In any case, 80% of the open interest increase disappeared in less than 24 hours.</p><h2>Futures’ buyers and sellers are matched at all times</h2><p>It can be assumed that most of the demand for leverage was driven by bullish sentiment, as Bitcoin's price climbed alongside the increase in open interest and subsequently plummeted as 80% of the contracts were closed. However, attributing cause and effect solely to Binance's court rulings seems unwarranted for several reasons.</p><p>Firstly, no one anticipated that the unsealed documents would favor Binance or its CEO, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, given that it was the SEC that had originally requested their release. Additionally, the Bitcoin futures contract funding rate, which gauges imbalances between long and short positions, remained largely stable throughout this period.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/5c2de4c2-186e-4856-aff5-17f3b72c06c8.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC futures average 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there had indeed been an unforeseen demand surge of $1 billion in open interest, primarily driven by desperate buyers, it's reasonable to assume that the funding rate would have spiked above 0.01%. However, quite the opposite unfolded on Sept. 19, as Bitcoin's open interest expanded to $11.7 billion while the funding rate plunged to zero.</p><p>With Bitcoin's price rallying above $27,200 during this second phase of open interest growth, it becomes increasingly evident that, regardless of the underlying motives, the price pressure tends to be upward. While the exact rationale may remain elusive, certain trading patterns could shed light on this movement.</p><h2>Market makers’ hedge could explain OI spike</h2><p>One plausible explanation could be the involvement of market makers executing buy orders on behalf of substantial clients. This would account for the initial enthusiasm in both the spot market and BTC futures, propelling the price higher. After the initial surge, the market maker becomes fully hedged, eliminating the need for further buying and leading to a price correction.</p><p>During the second phase of the trade, there is no impact on Bitcoi price, as the market maker must offload the BTC futures contracts and purchase spot Bitcoin. This results in a reduction in open interest and may disappoint some participants who were anticipating additional buying fervor.</p><p>Rather than hastily labeling every <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-bart-simpson-returns-as-btc-price-dives-7-in-hours\">\"Bart\" formation</a> as manipulation, it is advisable to delve into the operations of arbitrage desks and carefully analyze the BTC futures funding rate before jumping to conclusions. Thus, when there is no excessive demand for leveraged long positions, an increase in open interest does not necessarily signify a buying spree, as was the case on Sep. 18.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
