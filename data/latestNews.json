    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polkadot-rally-incoming-crypto-analyst-predicts-150-price-surge-for-dot/",
    "description": "The Polkadot (DOT) token has witnessed significant downward pressure over the past few weeks. This negative performance was further exacerbated by the recent downturn of Bitcoin’s value, which tumbled below $40,000 over the past week. However, the altcoin appears to be garnering momentum in the past few days, having rebounded positively from the $6 mark. A popular analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for DOT, saying the token looks set for a substantial upward move in the coming weeks. Can Polkadot Reach $17 In This Cycle? In a recent post on X, prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that the altcoins market is on the verge of a significant surge. Specifically, the crypto pundit singled out the Polkadot token as one of the assets to look out for.

The analyst identified the support zone between $5.60 and $6 while highlighting the need for this level to hold strong. 3-day chart showing different crucial zones of the Polkadot price &#124; Source: Michael van de Poppe/X If the support level holds, Michael van de Poppe believes that Polkadot’s price is primed for a substantial run to the upside in the current cycle. And the crypto analyst put forward an ultimate $17 target for the cryptocurrency if a breakout does occur. This potential price action would represent a massive 150% upswing from the current price point. Nevertheless, this would still be a long way from the token’s all-time high of $54.98 It is worth noting that Michael van de Poppe has also identified a price zone that will be integral to DOT’s possible run to $17. According to his analysis, there is significant resistance for the altcoin to overcome at around the $9.39 level. DOT last hit this price point on Boxing Day. Resistance caused the coin&#8217;s value to collapse; since December 26, 2023, it has dropped by almost 30%. DOT Price Overview? As earlier inferred, Polkadot&#8217;s price has performed poorly since the turn of the year. According to data provided by CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency’s value has dipped by almost 24% in the past month.

However, the coin is still red on the weekly timeframe, with a 2.3% price slump over the past seven days. Nonetheless, Polkadot ranks as the 13th-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of roughly $8.85 billion.
