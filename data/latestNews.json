    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-macro-index-expansion-400-bull-run/",
    "description": "In a detailed market update, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investment, has provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s current market position, highlighting a pivotal shift to an &#8216;expansion&#8217; phase in the Bitcoin Macro Index. This transition is particularly noteworthy as it parallels conditions observed prior to historical price surges in Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp uptick, ascending from $34,000 to an interim high of $38,000. After a brief period of resistance, the price corrected to approximately $36,500. Edwards highlights this movement as a critical technical victory, with Bitcoin overcoming and holding above the major resistance benchmarks of $35,000 on both the weekly and monthly timeframes. Related Reading: Bearish Divergence? Bitcoin Price Rises, But Network Growth Sends Warning Signals This consolidation above key resistance levels sets a bullish context in the high timeframe technical analysis, positioning Bitcoin in a strong technical stance according to traditional market indicators. &#8220;The recent breakout into the 2021 range offers the best high timeframe technical setup we have seen in years. Provided $35K holds on a weekly and monthly basis in November, the next significant resistance is range high ($58-65K).&#8221; Bitcoin Macro Index Enters Expansion The crux of Edwards&#8217; update is the shift in the Bitcoin Macro Index, a complex model synthesizing over 40 metrics encompassing Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data, macro market indicators, and equity market influences. The index does not take price as an input, thus providing a &#8216;pure fundamentals&#8217; perspective. The current expansion is the first since November 2020, and only the third instance since the index&#8217;s inception, with the two previous occasions leading to substantial price rallies in the following periods. Edwards elucidates this with a direct quote: “The transition from recovery to expansion is simply the optimal time to allocate to Bitcoin from a risk-reward opportunity for this model.” Related Reading: Why $36,300 Is the Key For Bitcoin’s Next Big Bounce: Insights From Liquidity Map A look at the Bitcoin chart reveals that the Bitcoin price rose by a whopping 400% during the last bull run from early November 2020 to November 2021, after the Macro Index entered the expansion phase. The first historical signal was provided by the Macro Index on November 9, 2016, which was followed by a massive bull run of almost 2,600% until Bitcoin reached its then all-time high of $20,000 in February 2018. Short-Term Technicals And Derivatives Market Analysis In the short term, the technical outlook presents a mixed picture, according to Edwards. The derivative markets are indicating an overheated state, with low timeframe analysis suggesting a retracement could be imminent. Edwards introduces the &#8216;Bitcoin Heater&#8217; metric, recently launched on Capriole Charts, which aggregate various derivatives market data and quantify the level of market risk based on the open interest and heating level of perpetuals, futures, and options markets. The below chart shows that most of the time when the Bitcoin Heater is above 0.8, the market corrects or consolidates. &#8220;But there are large exceptions to the rule: such as the primary bull market rally from November 2020 through to Q1 2021. [&#8230;] We should expect this metric to be high more frequently in 2024 (much like Q4 2020 – 2021),&#8221; Edwards stated. The analyst concluded that the overall trend for Bitcoin remains positive, with major data points indicating a strong bullish scenario. However, he also cautioned about potential short-term risks in the low timeframe technicals and derivatives market. These, according to him, are common in the development of a bull run and could offer valuable opportunities if dips occur. At press time, BTC traded at $35,626.
