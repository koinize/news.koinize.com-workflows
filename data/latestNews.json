The accusations of mishandling customers’ funds and violations of U.S. banking regulations were first flagged in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report </a>published by Reuters in the last week of May. At the time, Binance had refuted all the allegations and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-customer-fund-mismanagement-denial-against-mainstream-reports\">called the report a list of conspiracy theories</a>.</p><p>According to the regulator, Binance has been mixing \"billions of dollars\" in user assets and covertly moving them to a different firm under CZ's control. The accusations included misrepresenting to investors the effectiveness of the company's mechanisms for identifying and preventing manipulative trading. </p><p>Regulators further alleged that Binance had not done enough to prevent American investors from using its unlicensed exchange. Some of the key allegations in the lawsuit include:</p><ul><li>Zhao and Binance secretly controlled the Binance US platform’s operations behind the scenes.</li><li>Zhao and Binance exercise control of the platforms’ customers’ assets, permitting them to commingle customer assets.</li><li>BAM Trading (the entity that controlled Binance.US) misled investors about non-existent trading controls over the Binance.US platform.</li><li>Binance and BAM Trading were operating unregistered national securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies.</li><li>Binance and BAM Trading were involved in the sale of securities including Binance’s own crypto assets, including the exchange token, BNB, a stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), certain crypto-lending products, and a staking-as-a-service program.</li></ul><p>The list of 13 charges against the crypto exchange by the SEC comes within months of another lawsuit filed by the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in March invoked various reactions from the crypto community, the most prominent being the divide over Binance’s approach (Tai chi) and U.S regulators alleged “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”</p><p>The “Tai chi” reference comes from a 2020 Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/10/29/leaked-tai-chi-document-reveals-binances-elaborate-scheme-to-evade-bitcoin-regulators/?sh=179097802a92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report </a>that alleged that Binance has incorporated a series of steps to evade regulators in the U.S. naming it as a “Tai Chi entity.” Tai Chi is a Chinese term used to describe a method to evade responsibility. At the time Binance threatened to sue Forbes over these claims.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ If you are ever contacted by an individual named &quot;Michael Del Ray&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DelRayMan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DelRayMan</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForbesCrypto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ForbesCrypto</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forbes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Forbes</a> , do yourself a favor and block this individual immediately. <br><br>I will show in this thread how this individual plagiarized me for a huge <a href=\"https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@binance</a> expose ; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PENamerica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PENamerica</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PmuczsAq43\">pic.twitter.com/PmuczsAq43</a></p>&mdash; James Edwards (@librehash) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/librehash/status/1360033379866017794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/operation-choke-point-2-0-may-have-contributed-to-svb-collapse-mulvaney\">Operation Chokepoint 2.0</a>, on the other hand, is a term created by Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter to refer to an alleged effort by U.S. lawmakers and regulators to strife the growth of crypto.</p><p>Both theories resurfaced on June 5 after the SEC lawsuit where Cardano founder Charles Hokinson fueled the “chokepoint 2.0” theory.
