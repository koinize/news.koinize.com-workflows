Gox repayment deadline scheduled for October approaches, crypto observers expect a major industry event coming up this fall.</p>\n                    <p><p>While the cryptocurrency community is actively discussing the upcoming Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-bullish-microstrategy-michael-saylor\">halving in 2024</a>, there is potentially another big market event happening this year.</p><p>The trustee of the hacked Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is set to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mt-gox-repayment-registrations-closed-here-s-what-s-next\">finally repay the exchange’s creditors</a> by the end of October 2023. If that happens, the cryptocurrency market could be significantly affected in several ways, some industry observers agree.</p><p>Founded in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, estimated to facilitate around 70% of all BTC transactions before its implosion.</p><p>The now-defunct exchange lost 850,000 BTC — or <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-bitcoins-hard-cap-of-21-million-be-changed\">4% of all Bitcoin to ever be issued</a> — in a security breach in 2014. The event made Mt. Gox one of the biggest cryptocurrency bankruptcies of all time, with creditors yet to be repaid, nine years later.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/1166eb2d-ca44-41de-a65d-4748229f7de4.jpg\"  /></figure><p>As the current Mt. Gox repayment deadline is scheduled to occur in roughly three months, Cointelegraph has reached out to some crypto executives to find out what to expect from the anticipated Mt. Gox repayment.</p><h2>What will the investors do once they get their Bitcoin back?</h2><p>The repayment of Mt. Gox will be a unique event, which is certain to have a significant impact on the market, WhaleWire founder and CEO Jacob King believes.</p><p>After losing all their Bitcoin almost 10 years ago, the majority of creditors are likely to sell at least a part of their BTC once they finally get it back, King told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“This influx of sell orders could create a downward pressure on prices and potentially lead to a market downturn,” he said. King also mentioned multiple prolonged delays in the Mt. Gox repayment process, which has already caused a sense of “disillusionment among investors, eroding their confidence in the market.”</p><p>The WhaleWire CEO continued:</p><blockquote>“It’s a simple question of, what will the investors do? Over the last year, we’ve seen more sells than buys, and many of those who lost on Mt. Gox have moved on past crypto. The chances they hold for more years, after everything that happened, is highly unlikely.”</blockquote><p>“We are sure some will be glad to be able to finally cash out, but we doubt it will cause a massive sell off,” he stated. When asked whether the crypto industry has ever seen a similar event, Weert said that there hasn’t ever been an event on such a scale so far.</p><p>Some of the Mt. Gox creditors themselves admit that the Bitcoin market may face some selling pressure once the repayment is done. However, many claimants are likely to continue to HODL, one trader who described himself as a Mt. Gox creditor told Cointelegraph. He stated:</p><blockquote>“When we get our coins, I think we're all going to hold. But when the news hits the world that these coins are going to be released, people who have coins but who are not the claimants, are going to sell for fear of the price going down.”</blockquote><h2>How much will be repaid?</h2><p>Mt. Gox expects to repay a total of more than 10,000 crypto creditors from all over the world by the end of October. Despite the exchange losing 850,000 BTC, Mt. Gox will only repay part of the total losses from the hack because the firm was only able to recover some of the funds.</p><p>According to online reports, Mt. Gox will <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/393126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reimburse</a> its creditors 142,000 BTC ($4.3 billion) and 143,000 in forked cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index\">BCH</a>), worth roughly $40 million. The bankrupt exchange will also reportedly pay out 69 million Japanese Yen ($510 million). Payments will be made using a combination of fiat currency and cryptocurrencies, with each payout coordinated individually with each investor.</p><p>The repayment of Mt. Gox funds will be a massive event, Whale Alert co-founder Frank Weert agrees. But the way it influences the market will depend much on how the funds are released and how the media report it, the exec told Cointelegraph.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/eed3b240-b490-4834-b4bf-2b133f7aa53e.jpg\"  /></figure><p>Some major creditors, including Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds, reportedly <a href=\"https://financefeeds.com/mt-gox-biggest-creditors-to-receive-90-of-their-payout-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Alongside%20other%20claimants%2C%20who%20have,trust%20managing%20the%20exchange%27s%20liabilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">chose</a> to have their bankruptcy recovery funds paid out in Bitcoin.</p><p>According to data from the Mt.

Gox Bitcoin repayment amount is close to Michael Saylor’s BTC holdings</h2><p>While many crypto enthusiasts believe that Mt. Gox repayment will be a massive event, there are also some skeptics who are confident that any potential effects are likely to subside quickly.</p><p>The amount of Bitcoin that is to be handed back to Mt. Gox creditors is comparable to the holdings of Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/micro-strategy-buys-347m-worth-of-bitcoin-amid-market-thaw\">holds at least 152,333 BTC</a> ($4.52 billion).</p><p>“Either way, it doesn't seem like a lot,” Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph. Referring to the current worth of Bitcoin that is to be repaid, Greenspan emphasized that the current daily on-chain volumes are much bigger.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/30b-stolen-from-crypto-ecosystem-since-2012-report\"><strong><em>$30B stolen from crypto ecosystem since 2012: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>“Daily on-chain volumes are at an average of $12 billion, exchange volumes are reportedly in the neighborhood of $18 billion per day,” he noted, adding:</p><blockquote>“So this is certainly something the market can absorb in a relatively short time frame. I would assume there may be some sell pressure due to the speculation around this event. Many people don't know basic math.”</blockquote><p>Greenspan also stressed that Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin will be distributed to lots of people, which could be very good for the network as a “mass-distribution event.”</p><p>“That's a lot of OGs that will be reactivated. Some of them will sell and wash their hands but I bet many will be staunch advocates of self custody,” he added.</p><p>The exec also expressed optimism about the potential repayment, stating that Mt. Gox-related FUD has been “plaguing the market” for many years and it will be “good to see it finally put to bed.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/orange-pill-children-bitcoin-kids-books/\"><strong><em>Should you ‘orange pill’ children?

    "description": "<p>A newly released survey and report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claims if widely used, cryptoassets and stablecoins may threaten financial stability. </p>\n<p>The BIS published a new survey and report detailing the state of global CBDC (central bank digital currency) adoption and central banks&rsquo; view and plans regarding CBDCs.</p>\nAlmost 25% of Central Banks are Piloting Retail CBDCs\n<p>The report, entitled &ldquo;Making Headway &ndash; Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on central bank digital currencies and Crypto,&rdquo; finds the number of central banks planning on launching CBDC in the near future has doubled since the previous year, despite the chaos in the market.</p>\n<p>In its report, the BIS, however, warned of the risks of using cryptoassets for payments. It said:</p>\n\n<p>If widely used for payments, cryptoassets, including stablecoins, may constitute a threat to financial stability.</p>\n\n<p>While accepting the reality of widespread CBDC introduction, the BIS and other global regulators will issue guidelines to mitigate the danger it associates with the industry. The BIS explained:</p>\n\n<p>To strengthen and coordinate regulatory approaches to contain their risks to the financial system, the CPMI, IOSCO, FSB and BCBS published updated or new guidance and standards for stablecoins or crypto activities and markets more broadly.</p>\n\n<p>Through its research, the BIS found that almost a quarter of all central banks are currently piloting retail CBDCs. The BIS expects over two dozen such state-backed digital currencies to roll out by the decade&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;</p>\nBIS Expects 15 Retail, Nine Wholesale CBDCs To Launch\n<p>CBDCs have already been issued by Nigeria, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and parts of the Caribbean, and according to the survey, those regions will soon be joined by several other territories.</p>\n<p>The report explains that work on retail CBDCs is more advanced than wholesale CBDCs.</p>\n<p>The BIS report reads:</p>\n\n<p>Work on retail CBDC is more advanced than on wholesale CBDC: almost a quarter of central banks are piloting a retail CBDC. More than 80% of central banks see potential value in having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system, mostly because a retail CBDC has specific properties and may offer additional features.</p>\n\n<p>The BIS expects that by the end of 2030, 15 retail CBDCs, and nine wholesale CBDCs will be circulated in established and emerging economies.</p>\n<p>According to the report, 60% of surveyed central banks explained the arrival and rise of stablecoins had accelerated their development of CBDCs.</p>\n2022 Crypto-Chaos Leaves Central Banks Divided\n<p>2022&rsquo;s market spiral, however, did not convince all central banks of the necessity of CBDCs.</p>\n<p>The report find that while 93% of all central banks are exploring CBDCs in some way, an increasing number of those banks expressed with greater conviction that they would not issue a state-backed digital currency soon.</p>\n<p>The report states:</p>\n\n<p>A clear divergence has emerged: compared to last year, some central banks have become more likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years, while others indicated to be less likely to do so.</p>\n\nBIS Backs Tokenisation, But Says Crypto is a &ldquo;Flawed System&rdquo;\n<p>The BIS, considered by many as the central bank of central banks, recently released its plan for a global &ldquo;unified ledger&rdquo; that would support CBDCs and tokenized assets.</p>\n<p>According to the organization, tokenization offers a &ldquo;major leap&rdquo; in the financial system, calling it &ldquo;the next logical step.&rdquo; While it advocated for a centralized approach to the future of the monetary system, it dismissed decentralized cryptocurrencies as a &ldquo;flawed system.&rdquo; It said:</p>\n\n<p>Crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenization&rsquo;s promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the BIS argued that &ldquo;crypto has collapsed&rdquo;, and the successful use of tokenization relies on the trust provided by central banks.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ex-paxful-ceo-warns-users-to-stop-trading-are-their-funds-at-risk/",
    "description": "Paxful, founded in 2015, has established itself as one of the world&#8217;s prominent peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces, with a strong mission to enable financial access for individuals globally. Boasting an extensive user base of 9 million and offering over 350 payment options, the platform has garnered substantial popularity. However, on July 7, Ray Youssef, the former CEO of Paxful, conveyed a message to the platform&#8217;s users, urging them to cease trading activities. Financial Instability And Comparisons To FTX Collapse Youssef expressed concerns about the current state of Paxful, claiming that the company is now solely focused on paying legal bills and cautioned that no African or non-American should trust any IS corporation. These warnings from Youssef were prompted by reports that Paxful had removed the reserve funds amount from the platform&#8217;s status page. Related Reading: Paxful CEO Says He Has ‘Lost’ 5 Bank Accounts Reserve funds are often savings accounts or highly liquid assets placed aside to cover unforeseen financial responsibilities, and Youssef believes that Paxful&#8217;s lack of reserves puts the company at risk of financial instability. Without these funds, Paxful may struggle to manage cash flow fluctuations, fulfill immediate financial obligations, or respond effectively to emergencies. Consequently, this situation has the potential to jeopardize Paxful&#8217;s survival. Youssef also concurred with a Twitter user who compared Paxful and the collapse of FTX. The user highlighted that FTX, despite being one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, had filed for bankruptcy. This collapse was triggered by Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, announcing that his exchange would be dumping its FTT Token holdings, amounting to around $2 billion. The bank run that followed this announcement opened up a web of lies and mismanagement that led to the eventual collapse of the exchange. The announcement caused a sharp decline in the price of FTT and generated concern among investors. As a result, traders hurriedly withdrew their funds from FTX, leading the company to confront a substantial $8 billion shortfall. To prevent a similar case like FTX bankruptcy, Youssef advised Paxful users to withdraw their funds until further investigation is conducted to uncover the truth behind the situation. By taking control of their own cryptocurrency assets, users can mitigate potential risks and ensure the security of their investments Related Reading: FTX Puts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In AI Firm Anthropic On Hold Youssef&#8217;s Concerns And Allegations Post-Departure From Paxful Trading on various P2P marketplaces, including Paxful, was temporarily suspended in early April due to regulatory reasons. When Paxful announced the resumption of services, Ray Youssef, who had already left the organization, expressed his uncertainty regarding the current state of affairs and emphasized his inability to vouch for anything happening within Paxful. Since he departed from the exchange, Youssef has been actively promoting Civkit, the platform he founded. While many of his followers have praised his efforts, accusations have labeled him an attention seeker. Additionally, some individuals have accused him of leveraging his influence to undermine competitors and rivals in the industry. Featured image from Shutterstock, charts from TradingView.com"
