Each charge carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison. </p><p>“OneCoin’s so-called ‘Head of Legal and Compliance’ Irina Dilkinska accomplished the exact opposite goal of her position,\" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the statement.</p><blockquote>“As she has now admitted, Dilkinska facilitated the laundering of millions of dollars of illicit profits OneCoin accrued through its multi-level-marketing scheme.”</blockquote><p>The prosecution found that despite her role as the head of compliance for OneCoin, Dilkinsa played a key role in laundering money for the scheme. At one point Dilkinsa facilitated the transfer of $110 million in fraudulently obtained proceeds to an entity in the Cayman Islands. </p><p>Dilkinska’s sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 14, 2024 — where she faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for her role in the OneCoin scheme. </p><p>The Department of Justice <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-head-of-compliance-facing-40-year-sentence-after-us-extradition\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-head-of-compliance-facing-40-year-sentence-after-us-extradition/amp\">first charged Dilkinska with</a> one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering on March 21. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ex-deutsche-bank-banker-pleads-guilty-r3-crypto-fund-scheme\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/ex-deutsche-bank-banker-pleads-guilty-r3-crypto-fund-scheme/amp\"><strong><em>Former Deutsche Bank exec pleads guilty over ‘R3 Crypto Fund’ scheme</em></strong></a></p><p>OneCoin was founded in 2014 by “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova and Karl Sebastian Greenwood.
