Lightning is a layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. It is designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) transactions by enabling off-chain, peer-to-peer transactions.</p><p>In an Oct. 21 X (formerly Twitter) post, Deaton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1715727976149496144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">revealed</a> he is an angel investor in Spend the Bits, as well as its chief legal officer.</p><p>Deaton previously touted Spend The Bits as an alternative to Lightning on the Bitcoin blockchain. In September, the pro-XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) attorney commended the protocol, characterizing it as a more secure method for using your Bitcoin than Lightning.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Let me be clear and transparent: I am now involved in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Spend_The_Bits?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Spend_The_Bits</a> as an angel investor and serve as its Chief Legal Officer.  Therefore, please accept my comments with that in mind. But a major reason I invested in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Spend_The_Bits?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Spend_The_Bits</a>, or stated more accurately, invested in… <a href=\"https://t.co/aheyTxjGxp\">https://t.co/aheyTxjGxp</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1715727976149496144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Deaton’s Saturday disclosure was well-timed, aligning with an X post from the online crypto investigator WhaleWire. This tweet raised concerns about a recent discovery in Lightning <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-developer-antoine-riard-steps-back-lightning-network-dilemma\">indicating a significant security vulnerability</a> that prompted a developer to withdraw from the project.</p><p>The developer alleged the presence of deliberate vulnerabilities in the Lightning Network’s code, which could potentially provide attackers with complete network control. Major backers of the Lightning Network are also involved in Tether, Bitfinex and BlockStream. This claim has raised questions about Lightning’s security and trustworthiness.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/lightning-labs-releases-taproot-assets-alpha-bringing-stablecoins-to-bitcoin\"><strong><em>Lightning Labs releases Taproot Assets alpha, bringing stablecoins to Bitcoin</em></strong></a></p><p>Currently, the Lightning Network can handle transactions involving 5,338 BTC, <a href=\"https://1ml.com/statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to 1ML, comprising 0.025% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This has sparked doubts regarding the network’s resilience and long-term viability. In addition, the payment protocol has seen a 15% reduction in capacity over the past three months.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/recursive-inscriptions-bitcoin-supercomputer-defi-aws-possible/\"><strong><em>Recursive inscriptions — Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
