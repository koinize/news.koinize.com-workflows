With the latest update, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/telegram-wallet-avoided-self-custody\">users can see Wallet directly on the menu</a> without needing to find the bot or even know much about crypto to start using it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/f882de92-7be9-4171-814f-09079939ebfd.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Wallet bot available on the Telegram settings menu. Source: Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the default custodial wallet, users can also use Wallet’s self-custody crypto solution called TON Space. Wallet’s self-custody sub-wallet allows users to perform decentralized swaps within TON Space and transfer nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, using the self-custody wallet.</p><p>TOP has chosen to start the Wallet global rollout in developing markets to help users access more financial tools and to benefit from its significant user base in related regions.</p><p>“Our main focus is on developing markets where the lack of accessible financial tools has generated an organic demand for crypto assets,” a spokesperson for TOP told Cointelegraph. “We know that Telegram has a significant user base in these regions, and so it was only natural to start our global rollout in these jurisdictions,” the representative added.</p><p><a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/telegram-users-by-country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According</a> to data from World Population Review, Telegram has 4.49 million in Colombia as of 2023.

This is just the start of our goal to accelerate the mass market adoption of TON-based blockchain technology.”</blockquote><p>The representative also noted that the TOP preferred to roll out the wallet in smaller countries before scaling the operational side of the product, as well as the technical side of the integration. “This will ensure that we are able to efficiently scale to the additional demand generated as the rollout continues,” the spokesperson noted.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ton-raises-8-figure-sum-telegram-web3-super-app\"><strong><em>TON raises 8-figure sum from MEXC to make Telegram a Web3 super-app</em></strong></a></p><p>Following the initial rollout in Latin America and Africa, the Wallet crypto bot is expected to launch in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Turkey in Q1 2024. The TOP expects to finalize the global rollout of Wallet on Telegram by the end of Q2 2024, the announcement notes.</p><p>“These strategic enhancements to Wallet and TON Space underscore our continued dedication to simplifying the crypto experience for mainstream audiences while maintaining robust security features,” TOP CEO Andrew Rogozov noted.</p><p>Despite letting Wallet enter the Telegram settings menu, Telegram has actively denied any affiliation with Wallet or TOP, while Wallet also stressed that it was operating independently from Telegram.</p><p>Rogozov, CEO of TOP and Wallet companies, was once CEO of VK.com, a major social media platform created by Telegram founder <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/pavel-durov\">Pavel Durov</a>. Rogozov <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-platform-aims-pioneer-web3-110838698.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">resigned</a> from VK in January 2022 to join the TON Foundation as a founding member.

    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) finds itself in a curious position as it experiences minor dips in its 24-hour trading value, diverging from the upward momentum seen in altcoins such as LINK, ADA, and SOL. The surge in these alternative cryptocurrencies has been propelled by Bitcoin&#8217;s climb to the $36,000 level. Despite the broader market&#8217;s positive movements, SHIB&#8217;s recent performance prompts a closer examination of its resilience and potential trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Chart Described As ‘Beautiful’ By Crypto Analyst The Shibburn website has reported a remarkable surge in the burn rate, surpassing 3,000% in the last 24 hours, resulting in the incineration of over 9 million tokens. This significant increase in token burn raises a crucial question: What could be the potential impact of this heightened burn rate on SHIB&#8217;s price dynamics? Source: Shibburn Analyzing SHIB&#8217;s Current Price Trends As of the latest update from CoinGecko, SHIB is priced at $0.00000826, reflecting a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. However, the token has managed to secure a 5.9% gain over the last seven days, showcasing a level of volatility that demands a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing SHIB&#8217;s price movements. Investors keen on the Shiba Inu market are carefully scrutinizing this fluctuation, with the broader crypto market exhibiting robust rallies. While SHIB has dipped marginally in the short term, its seven-day gains suggest an underlying resilience that could be crucial in navigating the current crypto landscape. SHIB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Navigating A Formidable Barrier Adding to the complexity, Shiba Inu&#8217;s recent price surge has brought it to a critical juncture, approaching a significant barrier that could impede further gains. According to new data, SHIB faces a colossal 250 trillion barrier within its current trading range, spanning from $0.000008 to $0.000014. Within this range, a staggering 361,080 addresses have collectively acquired 250.23 trillion SHIB at an average price of $0.000011. SHIB market cap currently at $4.89 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Investors are closely watching this barrier, as breaking through or succumbing to it could be a pivotal moment for SHIB. The large number of addresses involved and the substantial quantity of SHIB acquired within this range underscore the significance of this price band and its potential impact on future market dynamics. Implications For Shiba Inu Investors The implications of this scenario raise concerns for Shiba Inu investors, as the token navigates both short-term fluctuations and the imposing 250 trillion SHIB barrier. The intensified burn rate, while potentially influencing the token&#8217;s scarcity, must be scrutinized against the backdrop of broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.
