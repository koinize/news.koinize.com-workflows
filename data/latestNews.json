Total bans were placed on technologies such as the public use of biometric surveillance, social scoring systems, predictive policing, so-called “emotion recognition” and untargeted facial recognition systems. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-considers-tightening-restrictions-on-ai-chip-exports\"><strong><em>US considers tightening restrictions on AI chip exports</em></strong></a></p><p>Prior to the bill actually becoming law, individual negotiations among parliament members will take place to finalize details of the EU AI Act. This recent letter comes as tech companies still have the time to petition lawmakers for more lenient measures. </p><p>The day before the letter was issued, the president of Microsoft paid a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-president-goes-europe-shape-ai-regulation-debate-2023-06-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">visit</a> to Europe to speak with regulators on how to best regulate AI. </p><p>Back in May, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/open-ai-warns-european-officials-over-regulations\">also spoke with European regulators</a> in Brussels.

However then it <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-led-petition-to-halt-ai-development-divides-tech-community\">called for a temporary pause</a> on any further development of AI and asking for regulations. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-blockchain-control-robots-incentivise-humans/\"><strong><em>How to control the AIs and incentivize the humans with crypto</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/blockchain-association-joins-coinbase-in-pushback-against-sec",
    "description": "<p>The Blockchain Association, a prominent lobbyist group for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, has called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to recuse himself from enforcing rules on the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>\nBlockchain Association Pens Open Letter&nbsp;\n<p>The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator&rsquo;s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler&rsquo;s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the &ldquo;Wells Process,&rdquo; which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler&rsquo;s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC&rsquo;s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.&rdquo;</p>\n\nCoinbase And The SEC&nbsp;\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange&rsquo;s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The only change is in the SEC&rsquo;s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>\n\nSEC Action On Crypto&nbsp;\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC&rsquo;s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC&rsquo;s action in the current scenario was unlawful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC&rsquo;s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency&rsquo;s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>\nThe Political Divide&nbsp;\n<p>Gensler&rsquo;s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler&rsquo;s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "The Ethereum network is currently witnessing a surge in interest following the recent Shanghai upgrade, which has expanded the options for holders of Ethereum (ETH). This has resulted in an uptick in the number of people staking their ETH in beacon deposit contracts, an indication of the growing confidence in the Ethereum blockchain since the upgrade. Since the Shanghai upgrade, the quantity of staked ETH has been increasing at a swift pace. This growth recently hit a peak, breaking previous records and suggesting that Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been received positively by the market. New Era For Ethereum The amount of Ethereum staked has now hit an all-time high (ATH), surpassing 25.8 million ETH, equivalent to a value of over $48 billion, according to the latest data shared by blockchain and crypto industry analytics platform, CryptoRank. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH This development has caused quite a stir in the crypto community and provides insight into the evolving dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain. Just a month earlier, in late May, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the $40 billion mark. This upward movement underscores the effectiveness of the new features introduced during Ethereum’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the PoS consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade. Furthermore, the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem has been profound. The surge in the Ethereum staking ratio since the upgrade is indicative of growing interest and faith in the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s potential.  This, in turn, reflects on the success of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge in aligning ETH with market expectations and needs. While the influx of staked ETH steadily rises, Ethereum&#8217;s creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently expressed concerns regarding the potential strain this could put on the network&#8217;s consensus. In a recent blog post, he urged caution, stating, &#8220;Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.&#8221; Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.

The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has surged from trading below $1,700 earlier this month to trading as high as $1,890, at the time of writing. Notably, the asset tapped and traded above $1,900 earlier today before slightly retracing to a 24-low of $1,843. Meanwhile, ETH has recorded more than $20 billion added to its market cap over the past two weeks. ETH trading volume has also surged over the same period indicating a rising trading activity.
