    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/binance-ceo-goes-bullish-on-bitcoin-whats-the-inside-scoop/",
    "description": "In a recent tweet, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO of Binance, drew attention to the dynamic nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s price and its increasing practicality. The tweet was timely, aligning with Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent above $31,450, marking its highest value since June 2022. This surge was primarily attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s endorsement of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, referred to as BITX, thereby establishing it as the inaugural leveraged bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by BlackRock contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market. Controversies Surrounding Binance And Its CEO Bitcoin has witnessed a progressive expansion in its practicality as an increasing number of merchants and service providers have embraced it as a viable payment option. The realm of Bitcoin has seen a surge in the availability of futures and options, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding Binance and its CEO, concerning the alleged employment of a &#8220;liquidation waterfall&#8221; strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin. Zhao has refuted these claims. Related Reading: The CEO of Binance Accuses the SEC – Where to Diversify Your Portfolio? Binance&#8217;s Integration Of Bitcoin Lightning Network Binance has recently announced noteworthy progress in integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, aiming to enhance the speed of deposits and withdrawals. Binance is currently in the process of integrating the network, with some technical aspects still pending completion. They recently shared their progress on Twitter, acknowledging that observant users had spotted their new lightning nodes. This confirms Binance&#8217;s active involvement in leveraging the Lightning Network to facilitate faster and more scalable Bitcoin transactions, ultimately enhancing user experience. The community eagerly awaits updates on Binance&#8217;s full integration of the Lightning Network. Related Reading: BNB Market Cap Down By 25% In June Amidst Binance Regulatory Pressure In a tweet, Zhao reaffirmed the exchange&#8217;s commitment to continuous growth, expressing their dedication to ongoing development. He stated, &#8220;Slowly, but we keep building&#8230;&#8221; The integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network aims to bring several advantages for users, including reduced transaction costs and faster settlement times. These improvements contribute to enhanced overall efficiency and convenience. The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value and utility has led to a significant milestone. The number of active Bitcoin addresses, excluding those with zero balances, has reached an unprecedented high of 44 million. A Closer Look At Recent Trends And Future Implications After experiencing a surge to over $31,000 following Fidelity&#8217;s application for Spot ETF, Bitcoin has now settled at $30,424, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $23,666B. While Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility continues to capture attention, another significant event looms on the horizon &#8211; the forthcoming Bitcoin halving. Anticipated to take place between April and May 2024, this 4th halving will bring about a reduction in block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at the 840,000 block height.
