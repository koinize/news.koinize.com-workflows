Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, highlighted the difference between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. DeFi Education Fund CEO Miller Whitehouse-Levine called the rules “confusing, self-refuting, and misguided.” Messari CEO Ryan Selkis stated that President Joe Biden’s reelection would mean no future for the crypto industry in the country. Representative Patrick McHenry, the House Financial Services Committee chairman, called the proposal “another front in the Biden Administration’s ongoing attack on the digital asset ecosystem.”</p><h3>Gemini files brief to dismiss SEC lawsuit</h3><p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has filed a reply brief as part of its efforts to dismiss the lawsuit it is facing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
