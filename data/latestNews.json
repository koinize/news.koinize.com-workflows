Our platform's infrastructure is designed to foster next generation lending solutions, and together we're showcasing what fair and transparent lending looks like, making a tangible difference in people's lives.\" says Erbil Karaman, CEO and Co-founder of Huma Finance.<p>There is a $5 trillion credit gap in emerging markets, with many individuals lacking access to formal credit and the small business financing ($500-$2,000) they need, halting their day-to-day business interactions and ability to serve their communities.</p><p>By utilizing Huma's DeFi infrastructure, Jia can expedite transactions with fairness and transparency, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to grow their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Jia is dedicated to serving small businesses in emerging markets. The company launched a $100,000 pool on Huma in May, which it has used to originate loans to more than 500 borrowers in Kenya and the Philippines.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the next six months, Jia is planning to scale up their credit solution even more to $500k, an increase of 400%. This growth projection sets the tone for a further 5x increase in a year's time given the borrower and lender demand.</p><p>Jia's pool reached full subscription less than 24 hours after launching, signaling a strong interest from accredited investors interested in this asset class.&nbsp;</p><p>The capital raised has already created transformative change in these small businesses.</p><p>With stories of borrowers like Dr. Elishaphan Obuya, a medical practitioner from Kisumu, Kenya, Jia&rsquo;s impact becomes tangible. Dr. Obuya, the founder of Shepher Lifecare, offers a range of medical services to hundreds of patients monthly. With Jia&rsquo;s credit solution, facilitated in partnership with Ilara Health, Dr. Obuya borrowed 142,800 KES ($1,012) to maintain a crucial supply of lifesaving medicines in his clinic.</p><p>Another inspiring story comes from Kristel Erestingcol in Manila, Philippines. Kristel operates a sari-sari store, serving her community with essential food items and school supplies. With a Jia loan of PHP 10,000 ($182), her second from the platform, Kristel has not only been able to buy more inventory in bulk at lower prices, but also expand her store's offering into new product lines including school uniforms and clothing.&nbsp;</p>\"Our mission is to drive economic growth in emerging markets by breaking down financial barriers. The extension of our credit solution on Huma is a testament to the potential we see in these markets,\" says Zach Marks, CEO and Co-founder of Jia.<p>Jia's expansion on the Huma platform is a strong signal of how DeFi can move away from speculative use cases, and allow entrepreneurs and small businesses in emerging markets to access digital financial resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, Jia and Huma are working on a roadmap to roll out features for a seamless real-world lending experience.</p><p>With the financial ecosystem becoming increasingly borderless and inclusive, the realization of global financial freedom seems within grasp.</p><p>About Jia</p><p>Jia is expanding financial freedom across the globe.

    "description": "<p>Leading web3 company Yuga Labs has announced its agreement to acquire tech innovator Roar Studios to bolster its ambitions Otherside project.&nbsp;</p>\nAdopting Roar&rsquo;s Tech For Otherside\n<p>The announcement was made on July 31 by Yuga Labs, home of popular NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), CryptoPunks, Meebits, and 10KTF. On the other end of the deal is tech innovator Roar Studios, working at the intersection of gaming, social media, and the metaverse.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/is-tether-the-safest-stablecoin-to-store-your-crypto-tradecurve-skyrockets-hits-4million",
    "description": "<p class=\"s6\">According to CoinMarketCap, Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. However, its safety has come under question in recent times. The question now is if Tether is the safest option for storing your crypto? Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a hybrid platform, has raised over $3 million in its presale, causing excitement among investors.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>\nIs Tether (USDT) the Safest Stablecoin To Store Your Crypto?\n<p class=\"s6\">Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin in the crypto market with a market capitalization of over $83 billion. Meanwhile, there are several factors to consider when ascertaining the safety of a stablecoin. One is the assets backing the stablecoin like gold, government treasury bills, etc. Also, the stablecoin issuer must have sufficient funds available to fulfill all redemption requests.</p>\n<p class=\"s6\">Despite being embroiled in controversy over the past year, the Tether coin has recently implemented measures to enhance transparency within its operations. Notably, the platform now publishes regular audits of its USD reserves. Additionally, Tether has made efforts to bolster its USD reserves.</p>\n<p class=\"s6\">According to the Q1 attestation conducted by financial services firm, BDO Italia, Tether possessed approximately $2.44 billion in excess reserves. Although the token has de-pegged from the USD more than 3 times in the past year, it has always rebounded.</p>\nTradecurve (TCRV) Presale Run Skyrockets With $3M Raise in Presale\n<p class=\"s6\">Tradecurve, a trading platform that has generated significant attention, has raised $4 million during its presale so far. The team anticipates raising a total of $20 million by Q3. Meanwhile, Tradecurve adopts a hybrid approach, blending elements of CEXs and DEXs, to establish a private trading environment. Safety is particularly crucial in the present era of data breaches, especially for traders who prioritize privacy.</p>\n<p class=\"s6\">Unfortunately, many traditional trading exchanges have yet to implement a Proof of Reserves (PoR) system, causing diminishing trust from traders. Interestingly, Tradecurve is out to fill this void, enhance user trust and promote the exchange's integrity by implementing PoR.</p>\nTradecurve (TCRV) To Hit &nbsp;$0.025 in Stage 5\n<p class=\"s6\">Tradecurve's TCRV token has captured significant attention in the crypto community. Over the past month, Tradecurve's price has skyrocketed by 150%, with the token surging from $0.015 to $0.025. What sets Tradecurve apart from rivals like Huobi and Coinbase is its emphasis on decentralization, user anonymity, and privacy.</p>\n<p class=\"s6\">Moreover, Tradecurve ensures that traders enjoy a smooth trading experience by providing quick withdrawals, deposits, and trade execution. At present, the token is in stage five of its presale, enabling investors to acquire it for $0.025 per token. Analysts predict that with the current bullish trend, the token could reach $0.029 in stage 6.</p>\nHow High Can Tradecurve Go?\n<p class=\"s6\">While the forthcoming 40% surge appears like a remarkable price jump, it doesn&rsquo;t compare with the long-term prediction for Tradecurve. Experts have predicted that the launch of the platform will attract a wave of traders to Tradecurve. This spike in activity is expected to cause a 50xsurge for Tradecurve in 2023 for TCRV to trade as high as $1 per token.</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">For more information about the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale:</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">Website: https://tradecurve.io/</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">Buy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">Twitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp</p>\n<p class=\"s16\">Telegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official</p>\n<p class=\"s6\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/crypto-beginners-top-cryptocurrencies-picks-pepe-floki-and-pomerdoge",
    "description": "<p>Pepe (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and Pomerdoge (POMD) - these projects have garnered attention for their growth potential in the crypto space. Today, we will examine all three of these tokens in greater detail and determine their appeal. Moreover, we'll discuss why many crypto beginners gravitate toward them.</p>\nSummary\n- Pepe shows a bullish technical analysis\n- Floki continues its uptrend\n- Pomerdoge expected to skyrocket by 17x\n<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>\nPepe (PEPE): A Fun Meme-Coin \n<p>Pepe (PEPE) was one of the top gainers in the meme coin market, offering early investors enormous gains in late June and early July. Given that the Pepe coin was created with no intrinsic value, this performance has been noteworthy. </p>\n<p>The Pepe coin price currently sits at $0.000001336 with a market cap of $523M, down 1.23% overnight. However, the Pepe technical analysis displays a bullish picture. In fact, all moving averages are showing buy signals. </p>\n<p>As a result, experts remain bullish on Pepe's long-term growth potential. Thus, forecast a jump to $0.00000179 for Pepe by December 2023. </p>\nFloki (FLOKI): On an Upward Trajectory\n<p>Inspired by the viral popularity of Elon Musk's pet Floki, the Floki Inu token quickly gained traction. Like other meme coins, Floki's price dynamics are influenced by market sentiment and social media buzz.</p>\n<p>In recent Floki Inu news, Binance Liquid Swap will sunset 31 liquidity pools, including FLOKI/USDT, as of August 4, 2023, at 4:00 a.m. UTC. But, this news did not impact the FlokiInu price, which now sits at $0.00002268 with a market cap of $213M. Hence, an increase of 1.43% in the last 24 hours. </p>\n<p>In addition, the Floki trading volume increased by 47.54% in that same time, reaching $15,579,332. With all these bullish signs, experts forecast Floki could surge to $0.00002986 within Q4 of 2023. </p>\nPomerdoge (POMD): Excellent Long-Term Growth Potential\n<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) presents an enticing proposition for crypto beginners who want to combine gaming and earning. The project combines P2E mechanics with NFTs to create an immersive and rewarding gaming experience. Players can build up their characters, trade in-game items in the Pomerplace, and participate in exciting arena battles. </p>\n<p>One of the standout features of the project is the promise to reward presale investors with a percentage of the revenue generated from the game. This unique revenue-sharing model allows investors to earn rewards proportionately to their tokens, adding a lucrative element to the gaming experience.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to deliver a memorable and valuable gaming experience, Pomerdoge has curated a collection of 7,777 exclusive NFTs. Each NFT will be priced at 0.2 ETH, unlocking a world of possibilities for their owners. Nevertheless, the project has kept the benefits of owning these NFTs closely guarded until closer to the launch. </p>\n<p>To participate in the acquisition of these exclusive NFTs, investors must hold POMD tokens. Currently, POMD has a presale price of only $0.007. But, this price will not be this low for too long as the presale is in Phase One. Many experts are forecasting that it will surge by 17x before it finishes. With all these features, POMD may leave Pepe and Floki in the dust.</p>\n<p class=\"s13\">Find out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today</p>\n<p class=\"s13\">Website: https://pomerdoge.com/</p>\n<p>Telegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.
