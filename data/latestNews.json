This includes bankrupt crypto platforms such as Three Arrows Capital (also known as “3AC”) and FTX. The firm will also be able to continue distributing assets to its creditors and processing claims.</p><p>The team instructed Wallet customers with assets on BlockFi to log into the app and submit a withdrawal request, which will allow the team to process the withdrawal. As for BIA and Loan customers, BlockFi said it's preparing for initial distributions in accordance with the bankruptcy plan. They expect the first distributions to be made in early 2024. Further distributions will be made after this point, but the amount of distributed funds will depend on BlockFi's success in FTX bankruptcy litigation, among other factors.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lender-block-fi-liquidation-plan-approval-repay-customer\"><strong>Crypto lender BlockFi gets court nod for plan to repay customers</strong></a></em></p><p>BlockFi was a crypto lending platform that first ran into liquidity problems in mid-2022 as the Terra stablecoin collapsed.
