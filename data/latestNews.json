    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-is-10-possible/",
    "description": "The Cardano network is showing bullish signs, which suggest that a price surge might be on the horizon for the ADA token. Based on price predictions made by some crypto analysts, the crypto token could rise to as high as $10 when this happens.  Cardano Network Is Healthy  Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Cardano network appears healthy. This is based on several metrics in which the network continues to experience significant growth. This includes the notable rise in daily active ADA addresses, transaction volume, and transactions from ADA whales.  Related Reading: CEO Of Blockchain-Focused VC Firm Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $10 Martinez noted that this increasing activity “signifies strong network engagement and investor interest, positive indicators for continued growth.” It further suggests that more investors are increasingly bullish on the Cardano ecosystem (specifically ADA) ahead of the next bull run. Cardano’s growth since last year has been one of the major talking points for some time now. At the beginning of this year, Bitcoinist reported that the network had gained more adoption since last year. Notably, Cardano achieved a significant milestone in December 2023, when all its blocks were reported to have been filled.  More recently, Bitcoinist also reported how the network has seen massive growth in new wallets. Between February 22 and 23, Cardano witnessed almost a 90% jump in wallet creation, increasing from 1,706 to 3,227. The report also noted how Cardano has a diversified investor base, with retail and large-scale investors wanting to get in on the ADA token.  ADA To $10? Cardano&#8217;s impressive on-chain fundamentals no doubt point to a massive rally from the ADA token. It also provides optimism that the crypto token rising to as high as $10 in the bull cycle is possible. Before now, several analysts had given their thoughts on how ADA’s price could increase exponentially when the bull market returns.  Related Reading: $906 Million Worth Of Ethereum Leave Exchanges Last Week – ETH To $4,000? Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello was among those who painted the most bullish picture for ADA, stating that it could rise to as high as $11. This prediction means that ADA will not only rise to the $10 mark but also surpass it. Meanwhile, crypto expert Jason Appleton (aka Crypto Crow) went as far as predicting that ADA will rise to $32 and noted that it will be one of the most altcoins when that time comes.  Ali Martinez once offered his ADA prediction when he mentioned how ADA could rise to $7 if it mirrors a historical move from 2020. ADA hitting $7 will undoubtedly make the $10 mark more feasible.  At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.78, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  ADA price at $0.78 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Zipmex, chart from Tradingview.com"
