Crypto supporters know the feeling. </p>\n                    <p><p>James Comer, chair of the United States House of Representatives Oversight and Accountability Committee, has threatened Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler with a subpoena. He <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Followup-to-SEC-re-doc-productions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in the letter dated Oct. 12, that the committee will have “no choice” but to use compulsory measures to obtain documents if the SEC does not start cooperating with it.</p><p>Comer also expressed concern about SEC “actions taken to circumvent Congress to further an agenda that harms American taxpayers.” Cryptocurrency proponents in Congress have often complained about Gensler in similar terms, but this letter is not about crypto. Rather, Comer was writing about coordination with the European Union (EU) on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and climate-related issues, as well as SEC stonewalling.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gensler is before the SEC’s oversight committee.<br>The Chairman opened by threatening him with a subpoena as they haven't been responding to requests from this committee<br>Chairman McHenry is going after him hard<br>Also this... <a href=\"https://t.co/uYLhyCyLRG\">pic.twitter.com/uYLhyCyLRG</a></p>— Alistair Milne (@alistairmilners) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alistairmilners/status/1712574288325165383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Comer and Senator Tim Scott, who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-republican-presidential-debate-feature-pro-crypto-candidates\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/first-republican-presidential-debate-feature-pro-crypto-candidates/amp\">is now running in the Republican</a> presidential primary, <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6.5.23-Letter-to-SEC-on-EU-ESG-Engagement-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> to Gensler in June asking for information about United States’ cooperation with the EU on climate legislation that could impact U.S. companies.

In his latest letter, Comer said:</p><blockquote>“To date, the SEC has not produced documents that are substantively responsive, and to date the overwhelming majority of documents produced have been publicly available on the SEC’s website, […] or documents that were already released pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.” </blockquote><p>These words practically mirror Patrick McHenry’s letter of April 12, where he wrote, “The 232 pages of documents provided by your staff after the briefing are publicly available and not responsive to the request.” McHenry was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/financial-services-chair-mchenry-send-sec-second-request-for-records-related-to-sbf-arrest\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/financial-services-chair-mchenry-send-sec-second-request-for-records-related-to-sbf-arrest/amp\">writing about his information request</a> relating to the prosecution of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. McHenry also threatened Gensler with a “compulsory process.” McHenry <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-committee-threatens-subpoena-ftx-documents\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/house-committee-threatens-subpoena-ftx-documents/amp\">repeated that threat in person</a> in a House Financial Services Committee hearing. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rep-patrick-mchenry-interim-house-speaker-mccarthy-oust\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/rep-patrick-mchenry-interim-house-speaker-mccarthy-oust/amp\">Crypto-friendly Patrick McHenry takes interim House Speaker position</a></em></strong></p><p>Crypto supporters will also hear echoes of themselves in Comer’s phrase “it is not clear that the law provides such authority and we must determine whether legislation is necessary.” In his first letter, Comer reminded Gensler of the Supreme Court’s West Virginia v.

It showed that prices increased 0.4% over the course of the month and 3.7% in the year preceding October 1. This was higher than the 0.3% for the month and 3.6% year-over-year estimated by Dow Jones. Traders interpreted the higher-than-expected figure as bearish for equities, as it could imply that the Federal Reserve will need to keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously expected as they attempt to keep inflation under control.</p><p>Despite this decline in the overall market, shares of some retail-sector companies did unusually well.
