Daily events kicked off with the playing of the U.S. national anthem on trumpet as a digital American flag waved on screen, and doors were open to exclusive fundraisers with many speakers in exchange for a sizable donation. In RFK Jr.’s case, the recommended donation started at $1,000; for Ramaswamy, $3,300 for an attendee; for Lummis and Cruz, $250.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Such a fun panel at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NABSummit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NABSummit</a> chatting about the latest on crypto legislation, the SEC, and the 2024 election.

In 2023, the event included QR codes linked to campaign websites scattered across lounge areas and calls to donate to crypto-friendly politicians prior to panels.</p><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph on Nov. 16, RFK Jr.’s campaign message seemed to be focused on taking Americans’ personal finances out of the control of centralized institutions and the U.S. government. He also commented on discussions in Congress about whether members should be allowed to hold certain assets like stocks and crypto, in contrast to average retail investors.</p><p>“I own crypto, I own Bitcoin, and if I get into office I’m going to do things that make Bitcoin more valuable,” said the presidential candidate. “I’m not doing it to benefit my personal portfolio but I think it’s important for the public to know that I have that conflict and that I should have to disclose that conflict at the very least.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-emmer-crypto-sleeper-issue-2024-elections\"><strong><em>Rep.
