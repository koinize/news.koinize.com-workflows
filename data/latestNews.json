In addition to this, on-chain data has revealed some whales are expanding their holdings in preparation for the rebound.Â Â  Large XRP Transactions Hint At Accumulation Various on-chain data has shown large XRP transactions in the past few weeks to and from exchanges, suggesting some whales might be accumulating XRP tokens.
