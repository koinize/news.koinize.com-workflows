Although China has deemed all foreign digital assets illegal by imposing a blanket ban, the report argued that virtual assets held by individuals should be considered legal and protected by law under the current policy framework.</p><p>The report also added suggestions to deal with crimes involving virtual assets and noted that since the money and property involved in the case cannot be confiscated, it should be based on the unification of criminal and civil law order.
