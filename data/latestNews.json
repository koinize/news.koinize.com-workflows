    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed &#8220;Dogecoin Killer,&#8221; is back in the spotlight with a surge in both search interest and token price. Google Trends data reveals a global increase in searches for &#8220;Shiba Inu&#8221; and related queries, indicating renewed investor optimism for the meme coin. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike? Shiba Inu Surge Sparks Enthusiasm This increase comes after a quiet period for the memecoin. However, the past month has been nothing short of phenomenal. Search popularity reached a seven-day peak of 100 on March 16th, though it has settled at a still-healthy 48 – significantly higher than January&#8217;s levels. Phrases like &#8220;Why is Shiba Inu going up?&#8221; and &#8220;Shiba Inu All-Time High&#8221; have also seen a significant uptick, reflecting investor curiosity and potential buying interest. While the interest is global, specific regions are leading the charge. Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria have emerged as the top search originators for SHIB in the past week. This geographically diverse interest suggests a broad-based appeal for the meme coin. Source: Google Trends This renewed interest coincides with a remarkable price rally. SHIB&#8217;s value has skyrocketed over 180% in the past month, reaching a two-year high of $0.000045. This bullish run fueled speculation of a retest of its all-time high above $0.000088. However, the market has since witnessed a correction, bringing SHIB&#8217;s price down slightly. Despite the correction, the enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu community remains high. The long-term goal of reaching $0.01 per SHIB token continues to be a hot topic, although analysts caution it might take several years to materialize. Bitcoin is now trading at $66.780. Chart: TradingView Shibarium And Market Recovery To achieve this ambitious target, the developers are focusing on Shibarium, the project&#8217;s Layer-2 scaling solution. Shibarium aims to become a thriving smart contract hub, potentially attracting more users and driving up demand for SHIB. Experts believe several factors are contributing to the current Shiba Inu frenzy. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery after a recent slump, potentially boosting investor confidence in meme coins like SHIB. Additionally, ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as Shibarium and the burning initiatives to reduce the overall token supply, might be fueling investor optimism. Related Reading: Eyes On Toncoin: Speculation Rises After 40% Weekly Surge – What Comes Next? Whether SHIB can maintain its current momentum and reach its long-term price goals remains to be seen. However, the recent surge in search interest and price rally is a clear indication that the &#8220;Dogecoin Killer&#8221; is back in the game, attempting to capture the hearts (and wallets) of memecoin enthusiasts worldwide.
