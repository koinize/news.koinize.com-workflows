Recent moves by Hong Kong could help reverse that trend, said the blockchain analytics firm.</p>\n                    <p><p>Recent crypto advancements in Hong Kong could provide a “potential tailwind” to lift crypto activity in the East Asian region, which has mainly suffered from a China-wide ban on trading activities since 2019.</p><p>Cryptocurrency value received in East Asia amounted to just 8.8% of the world between July 2022 and June 2023, <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/eastern-asia-cryptocurrency-adoption/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to an Oct. 2 report from Chainalysis, making it the fifth most active crypto market. However, Chainalysis said Hong Kong’s recent moves could help increase this number. </p><blockquote>“A potential tailwind for East Asia comes from Hong Kong, where several crypto initiatives and industry-friendly regulations launched over the past year have fostered bubbling optimism.\"</blockquote><p>Data from Chainalysis reveals that East Asia’s share of crypto transaction value went from around 30% in 2019 to less than 10% by the second quarter of 2022, after a number of crypto-related bans in China.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/eac97c51-ee36-4e48-b59e-66b0fd77a3df.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Share of cryptocurrency transaction value by region, with Eastern Asia colored in yellow.
