Powell responded:</p><blockquote>“We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, […] and we believe that it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoin going forward.” </blockquote><p>“Allowing a lot of private money creation at the state level would be a mistake,” he added. </p><p>By providing commentary on the draft bill, Powell took a position that runs contrary to that of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-holds-tight-to-his-crypto-position-in-preview-of-senate-testimony\">spoke at a Senate Banking Committee</a> hearing last year and said that stablecoins may require registration and regulation and has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lawyers-flame-gensler-over-claims-that-all-crypto-are-securities\">repeatedly stated that all cryptocurrencies</a> except Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) are securities. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-stablecoins-securities-well-its-not-so-simple-say-lawyers\">Are stablecoins securities? Well, it’s not so simple, say lawyers</a></em></strong></p><p>Powell’s position does not conform any better to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair Rostin Behnam’s claim that stablecoins <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoins-and-ether-are-going-to-be-commodities-reaffirms-cftc-chair\">will be determined to be a commodity</a>.

Giancarlo said: </p><blockquote>“The simple fix to this problem is to provide that government licensing authorities have no discretion to pick and choose among otherwise lawful activities and condition licensure on the stablecoin’s denial of legal transactions.\"</blockquote><p>Otherwise, “stablecoin transactions will be frighteningly beholden to the shifting political winds of Washington,\" Giancarlo said.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/unstable-coins-de-pegging-bank-runs-other-risks-2023/\">Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

The rise in crypto prices is helping to narrow the appreciation <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fed-rate-pause-triggers-traders-pivot-to-stocks-will-bitcoin-catch-up\">gap between equities</a> and the cryptocurrency market which widened after the Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/6d69b2e9-5963-4508-8213-5ddc42759bdd.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Total crypto liquidations in 1-day.

The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bipartisan-support-crypto-regulation-attractive-to-firms-moodys\">lack of bipartisan support</a> on crypto regulation makes it unlikely that any significant legislation will pass the U.S. Congress, meaning many cryptocurrencies may be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trading-crypto-as-non-securities-over-says-exchange-ex\">classified as securities</a> by the SEC. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-miami-2023-shitcoins-for-bitcoin/\">Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with ‘shitcoins on Bitcoin’</a></em></strong></p><p>Let’s examine three of the major factors influencing the day’s crypto market strength.</p><h2>The Bitcoin ETF buzz</h2><p>Speculations around the potential for the first Bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S. helped the crypto market price to bounce. The speculation skyrocketed after the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock filed a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-apply-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-nasdaq\">Bitcoin spot ETF</a> with the SEC on June 16. </p><p>Notably, BlackRock, an investment firm managing $9.5 trillion in assets, has applied for 576 ETFs, facing only one rejection. Market analyst Lark Davis predicts an SEC approval could have the asset manager purchase every single Bitcoin available across crypto exchanges. Davis made the statement in the filing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1669751744182779904\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">noting</a>:</p><blockquote>\"Only about 10% of all Bitcoin [worth $50 billion] is sitting on exchanges. 0.5% of BlackRock money movings to BTC would buy every single coin available.\"</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, the SEC has rejected all Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from asset managers like VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise. WisdomTree is the most recent investment firm to lodge a new filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF that has been rejected by the SEC twice. The first rejection took place in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-wisdomtree-s-application-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-again\">December 2021</a> and again in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-wisdomtree-s-application-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-again\">October 2022</a>. WisdomTree, a New York based asset management fund, oversees approximately $83 billion in assets. Another notable asset management fund, <a href=\"https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-038.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Invesco</a>, reactivated an application for a Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe exchange. </p><h2>Bullish crypto market sentiment is rising</h2><p>While Bitcoin and altcoins still have risk events that can impact the price, BTC futures are showing traders switching from majority short to long. According to Coinglass, 54.24% of traders are long Bitcoin at a ratio of 1.2 compared to BTC shorts. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/c543fa2d-8171-471f-acc4-176b8cc378e6.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin long versus short ratio. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><p>Combined with reduced spot volume and Bitcoin’s net exodus from exchanges, prices may see further volatility. Typically, when there is a greater net outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges, sell pressure decreases allowing short liquidations to influence the BTC price at a greater magnitude. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/188c4a6d-0eb2-4a66-ad38-56cb2a4091c9.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin net exchange position change. Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Fed interest rate pause increases risk appetite</h2><p>At the June 14 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Fed Chairman Jerome Powell revealed that the central bank would pause rate hikes for June. While this move aligned with investors’ expectations, the crypto market did not initially match the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hawkish-fed-stocks-market-rally-and-crypto-falling-behind\">equities’ market bullish</a> momentum.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today\">Why is Bitcoin price up today?</a></em></strong></p><p>While Bitcoin and Ether price has been impacted by the recent <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today\">negative enforcement news</a>, today’s rally shows a flash of bullish momentum. The Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-this-week-fear-26k-key-5-things\">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a> has reached a 3-month high highlighting that investors are more apt to take on risk assets. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/2612ccd0-3f03-4c8e-89c7-49b036336166.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, crypto markets are likely to continue seeing price volatility powered by macro events. While the positive news of BlackRock’s ETF filing and renewed institutional interest is providing a nice short-term bump in crypto prices, the market’s reaction to any potential enforcement actions or economic recession will be the true determinant of which direction the market chooses to take. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
