The team said back then that it planned to use the funds for “expansion in the Asia Pacific Region” and was in the process of moving its headquarters from the Cayman Islands to Hong Kong.</p><p>The reported move appears to be part of a wider crackdown on cryptocurrencies by Chinese authorities.

With a budget of $10 million, the fund will incentivize Web3 projects to set up subsidiaries or headquarters in the special administrative region of China (SAR). The fund is headed by Paul Chan Mo-Po, financial secretary of Hong Kong SAR.</p><p>Despite the growing traction, BitKeep researchers reminded that HK regulations remain strict for the time being:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The new regulations clearly limit the types of tokens that can be traded and the types of services that exchanges can provide.

    "description": "The recovery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the start of the year brought about hopes that the bear market had finally come to an end. However, the market has since reversed with assets in the space losing a good portion of their Q1 gains. With the current trend, it is more than likely that the bear market is not over. Historical Bitcoin Trends Suggest Otherwise Over the last four bull markets that Bitcoin has seen since its inception, a number of things stand out. The first is that the bear market following a bull market does not seem to come to an end until the year of the halving. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The Bitcoin Halving is an important event because it cuts down the BTC block rewards in half, hence reducing the number of new BTC being released into circulation. This is a bullish event and has always heralded the start of the bull market for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the market is still about a year away from the next Bitcoin halving set to happen in 2024, and if historical trends are anything to go by, then the bear market is likely to persist through 2023 and into early next year before the first hallmarks of the bull run are seen. Following previous trends, there could still be more pain for BTC to come. If it is to lose around 85% of its all-time high value as it did before the last bull run, then the bottom of the market has likely not been reached yet either. Each bull market began with a halving event &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Investor Sentiment Remains Low After the euphoria of the pump in the first half of 2023 died down, investors have been at a loss when it comes to pitching their tents. As a result, investor sentiment has drawn to a standstill as the Crypto Fear &#38; Greed Index now sits at a neutral 52. This means that investors are not doing anything bullish like buying more Bitcoin at this time, so the bear market is persisting as sellers continue to dominate. A return back into the greed territory would see prices rise again but this is unlikely given that buyers are likely waiting for BTC to revisit $20,000 before getting back in the game. Related Reading: Optimism Crashes 33% Following Token Unlocks, Why There Could Be More Pain To Come For now, BTC is still ranging below $27,000, a support level that bears have successfully flipped into resistance. However, it is still trading above its 100-day moving average, which suggests bullish momentum in the short term, albeit a short-lived one.
