The participation will be limited to observer capacity for the FSA in its current phase. Regulators wrote: </p><blockquote>\"The project aims to test the feasibility of applications of digital technologies such as asset tokenization through pilot experimentations, while managing risks to financial stability and integrity. Current industry pilots include fixed income, foreign exchange, and asset & wealth management.\"</blockquote><p>Established in May 2022 by the MAS, Project Guardian <a href=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/project-guardian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">seeks</a> to test the \"feasibility of applications in asset tokenisation and DeFi,\" in accordance with proper regulations. The project has four areas of focus; open and interoperable networks, trust anchors, asset tokenization, and institutional grade DeFi protocols. In one notable project from the initiative: </p><blockquote>\"DBS Bank, JP Morgan and SBI Digital Asset Holdings conducted foreign exchange and government bond transactions against liquidity pools comprising of tokenised Singapore Government Securities Bonds, Japanese Government Bonds, Japanese Yen (JPY) and Singapore Dollar (SGD).\"</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, HSBC, Marketnode, and UOB have since concluded a pilot test of a blockchain-structured product, while UBS is exploring the issuance of Variable Capital Company funds on digital asset networks. Project Guardian isn't the first collaboration between the FSA and MAS. In 2017, the two regulators <a href=\"https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2017/20170313-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">established</a> a joint fintech cooperation framework to promote innovation in their respective markets. </p><p>The collaboration also follows a period of relaxation on crypto laws in Japan. On June 25, Cointelegraph reported that Japan's National Tax Agency <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/token-issuers-in-japan-exempt-from-30-crypto-tax-on-paper-gains\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/token-issuers-in-japan-exempt-from-30-crypto-tax-on-paper-gains/amp\">ruled to exempt token issuers</a> from a 30% tax on unrealized capital gains.

During the June 14 interview recording, host Benjamin Pirus discussed several topics with van de Poppe, such as his opinions on what might drive Bitcoin’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) price over the rest of 2023. His answer, in part, references United States regulations.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/8200e349-78a8-4774-8b03-44c003a2fa7f.jpg\"  /></figure><p>“I think if there’s clarity on the framework that’s being established in the U.S. in terms of whether or not cryptos are going to be securities or commodities — that’s going to push markets,” van de Poppe said, adding:</p><blockquote>“Because if you have that framework, it opens up for more institutional investors. I don’t believe that the U.S. is going to be the big one. I think the other parts of the world are already stepping in.”</blockquote><p>In mentioning other regions’ crypto-related regulatory environments, van de Poppe highlighted the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-s-new-crypto-law-how-mica-can-make-europe-a-digital-asset-hub\">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework</a> from the European Union, which was approved in late May. “I think the U.S. is behind, but the more we get clarity on that, it’s going to be beneficial for the markets and activate more liquidity into the markets,” he explained.</p><p>The trader also noted the macroeconomic conditions potentially affecting Bitcoin significantly, such as the situation around interest rates and unemployment in the United States and other countries. “I think all those factors are going to move all the markets, including Bitcoin, and that’s what we need to find out in the rest of the year whether or not there is going to be a recession and whether or not Bitcoin is going to be the big winner or the big loser,” van de Poppe said. </p><p>Van de Poppe also spoke about several other topics, including his early interest in the stock market as a kid.</p><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2095786\"></template><p>Check out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph’s <em>Crypto Trading Secrets</em> podcast on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/crypto-trading-secrets\">Cointelegraph’s podcast page</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/crypto-trading-secrets/id1659011738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/35pGCmJHXavmAuixlHidFR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yMDk1Nzg2LnJzcw==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Google Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://tunein.com/podcasts/Business--Economics-Podcasts/Crypto-Trading-Secrets-with-Benjamin-Pirus-p3083471/?topicId=225031379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TuneIn</a>.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "description": "The Arbitrum (ARB) token has been on the rise lately, with a 20% price increase in the past seven days. The cryptocurrency is the native token of the Arbitrum network, which is a Layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. This protocol is designed to boost transaction speed, enhance scalability, and improve privacy on the Ethereum network. ARB Continues Market Recovery &#8211; Jumps By 18% In Two Weeks The ARB token has seen a mixed price performance in June, initially falling beneath the $1 mark just before the middle of the month. However, the coin has been showing signs of recovery lately, jumping by more than 30% since June 15. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Continues To Build Momentum, Jumps Nearly 27% In A Single Week After hovering around the $1 level &#8211; with little price action &#8211; between June 17 and 19, the Arbitrum price eventually broke above this threshold on the 20th of June. The cryptocurrency has been on a positive momentum since then. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), an on-chain indicator that tracks the balance between buying and selling pressure, signals that a positive trend is forming for Arbitrum. The daily RSI is well above the 50 mark, indicating increased buying pressure. According to CoinGecko, the ARB token is currently trading at $1.21, with a 6% gain in the last 24 hours. As of today, the cryptocurrency has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $373 million, which also increased by 42.1% in the past day. ARBUSD trading at $1.2182 &#124; Source: ARBUSD chart from TradingView Arbitrum Market Experiences Massive Whale Activity It is difficult to definitively say what is driving the price of Arbitrum at the moment. However, there has been high whale activity in the market in the past few days, suggesting that there may be something going on that most investors are not seeing.  According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, two dormant whales bought ARB tokens just before major price movements. On June 25, whale “0x1b67” became active after 1.6 years of dormancy and withdrew 450,881 ARB (worth roughly $507,000) from Binance. Prior to this transaction, another whale (0x79cc), who had been dormant for six months, purchased 1.57 million ARB tokens with 939 ETH (worth $1.68 million at the time) on June 20.  Furthermore, there has been some major whale accumulation in the market in the past 24 hours. According to Lookonchain, whale “0xb28f” purchased 321,934 ARB with 200 ETH (roughly $375,000) in the early hours of today. It is worth noting that this whale made a similar purchase on June 10, spending 300 ETH (around $528,000) to buy 538,558 ARB tokens. Whales are buying $ARB!
