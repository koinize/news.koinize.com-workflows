    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/",
    "description": "As the crypto market experiences another wave of fervent enthusiasm, meme coins like Shiba Inu, PEPE, and Dogecoin have surged to the forefront of investors&#8217; minds. With PEPE leading the rally at a staggering 371% increase, Dogwifhat (WIF) at 351%, FLOKI at 331%, BONK at 182%, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) at 177% over just the last seven days, the phenomenon has caught the eye of both enthusiasts and skeptics alike. Why Shiba Inu, PEPE, DOGE Will Continue To Rally Andrew Kang, co-founder and partner at Mechanism Capital, offered a deep dive into the dynamics fueling this unprecedented meme coin frenzy. Kang, sharing his expert analysis on X, articulates the foundational appeal of meme coins: &#8220;People are really calling top on meme coin season when BTC hasn&#8217;t even crossed ATH yet. Meme coins are a global shelling point for speculative liquidity.&#8221; He stresses the accessibility of meme coins as a crucial factor in their explosive growth, positioning them as more globally accessible than any traditional stock. This accessibility, combined with a universal speculative interest, has led to Dogecoin&#8217;s significant outperformance compared to phenomena like the GameStop stock frenzy. The historical context Kang provides is telling of the potential he sees in this cycle. &#8220;Total Meme coin market cap last cycle was $100 billion last cycle, and we usually get multiples on market cap highs every cycle,&#8221; he notes, suggesting that the current market conditions are ripe for surpassing previous records. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Just Ballooned To 124% – What’s Pushing The Price Up? His insights reveal a broadening demographic of meme coin investors, including high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds, and even traditional financial institutions, all drawn in by the speculative allure and community-driven narratives of these assets. Meme Coins Are A Skill-Based Lottery Kang&#8217;s perspective on the meme coin ecosystem is particularly illuminating. He likens it to a &#8220;Skill-based Global Lottery Platform,&#8221; where success is part skill, part community effort, and part viral momentum. &#8220;We are going to reach some serious levels of mental retardation for memecoins this cycle [&#8230;] And the more people that they get to buy the same tickets at them, the more likely they and their friends win &#8211; that&#8217;s the best feeling &#8211; winning together,&#8221; Kang elaborates. This communal aspect of meme coin trading, combined with the thrill of speculation, underscores the unique appeal of meme coins as both a financial instrument and a social phenomenon. Expanding on the potential scale of meme coin growth, Kang draws an ambitious parallel with the global lottery industry, which boasted $300 billion in sales in 2020. &#8220;Now imagine the valuations of memecoins if a capital injection of that scale were to flow into them,&#8221; he muses, positing a future where meme coins command a significant portion of global speculative investment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Skyrockets By 28%: 4 Key Reasons Kang also critiques the broader cryptocurrency market, suggesting that the complexity and niche appeal of many projects may limit their attractiveness to the general public. &#8220;The masses won&#8217;t care about the 4th liquid restaking derivative or whatever fancy new technology [&#8230;] Memecoins are just a much more pure and upfront speculative vehicle,&#8221; he states, predicting that meme coins could outperform more technologically complex crypto assets by a wide margin. The King Of All Meme Coins A strong advocate for strategic investment in meme coins, Kang draws an analogy a Bitcoin investment for tradfi investors, suggesting that a small, measured allocation to meme coins could offer disproportionate rewards. &#8220;Advocating for a 1-5% portfolio allocation of memecoins is like boomers advocating for 1-5% portfolio allocation of BTC,&#8221; he says, emphasizing the blend of high risk and high reward that meme coins represent. Highlighting Dogecoin&#8217;s unique position within the meme coin space, Kang points to its potential for real-world application and celebrity endorsements as key factors in its potential for dominance. &#8220;DOGE is the king of memecoins [&#8230;] Elon is a people&#8217;s man and I doubt he keeps his silence on Doge/X payments much longer. [&#8230;] Sam Altman has 1% float WLD and Elon has DOGE. It is obvious that the AGI will choose the more decentralized currency,&#8221; he suggests. At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00002642.
