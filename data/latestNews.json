Axident spoke to the significance of fans in the music industry and how blockchain and music rights open up an entirely new world of interactions. </p><blockquote>“The ownership of a song bears far greater weight than its monetary value; it forges a profound connection to the art that, until now, has been beyond the reach of fans.”</blockquote><p>Upon the song’s initial release as a single, it made it into Australia’s top forty and landed at 53 on the U.S. charts. To date, the track has massed over 500 million streams. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/youtube-releases-principles-for-working-with-ai-music-industry\"><strong><em>YouTube releases ‘principles’ for working with music industry on AI tech</em></strong></a></p><p>Cointelegraph spoke with Michel D. Traore, the co-founder and CEO of anotherblock, who said that delivering universally beloved songs is a powerful way of “acquainting” the masses to Web3. </p><p>“\"Company\" serves as a prime example of a song with immense potential in this regard. Through the Web3 tools, we can offer music enthusiasts something that, until recently, hasn't been accessible to the general public.”</p><p>Traore highlighted that the royalty share is being divested by Axident. “Producers often do not receive the recognition they truly deserve,” he said “and one significant aspect for us is to shine a light on the creators behind the songs.”</p><blockquote>“This not only creates a new revenue stream for producers but also provides fans with the opportunity to discover and connect with these talented individuals and their incredible work.”</blockquote><p>Anotherblock has already worked on Web3 ventures with some of the largest names in the music industry, including pop sensations The Weeknd, Rihanna and Martin Garrix.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/tokenizing-music-royalties-nfts-taylor-swift-3lau-nas-the-weeknd/\"><strong><em>Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-aptos-ape-more-token-unlocks-this-september/",
    "description": "September is gearing up to be a pivotal month in the crypto space, with a series of substantial token unlocks for Solana, ApeCoin, Worldcoin, Optimism, dYdX and Aptos on the horizon. Popular crypto voices, @TheDeFinvestor and @wacy_time1, have taken to Twitter to provide insights, speculations, and analyses on these impending events. Here&#8217;s a consolidated look at their perspectives. ApeCoin (APE) Set to witness one of the most significant unlocks this month, APE will release $54.8 million, which represents 11% of its circulating supply, on Sept. 17. Both influencers highlighted the magnitude of this event. @TheDeFinvestor pointed out that most of the unlocked tokens would go to insiders, specifically launch contributors. Drawing from history, the last time a large amount of APE tokens entered circulation, the price experienced a sharp dip. @wacy_time1 mentioned the potential risks of shorting APE, especially given its current position. Since the beginning of the year, the APE is in a steep downtrend which saw price decline by 80%. Worldcoin (WLD) WLD is set for a daily unlock of $3.38 million. @TheDeFinvestor emphasized that in a year, the circulating supply of WLD would be three times its current amount.The token&#8217;s value has reportedly decreased by almost 50% since its launch. Despite this downtrend, both influencers cautioned against shorting it due to its large VC backers and potential price manipulations. Related Reading: VISA’s Stablecoin Payments On Solana Propel SOL To 5% Gain, Bulls Eye Price Breakout Solana (SOL) Solana is set for an unlock of $10.3 million from staking on September 7. @wacy_time1 provided an analysis suggesting that a majority of the 2756 stakers receiving 531,574 SOL might not immediately sell. The influencer believes that any price drop could be an accumulation opportunity, emphasizing the potential of Solana. Remarkably, just yesterday, Solana announced that payments giant Visa is scaling their USDC settlement pilot to include the Solana blockchain, enabling enterprise-grade throughput at virtually no cost for Visa issuers and merchant acquirers on Solana. The SOL price reacted with a 5% surge but couldn&#8217;t take out the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the 1-day. As long as this mark is not surpassed on a daily closing basis, further upside potential seems ruled out. Optimism (OP) OP will unlock $32.3M, or 3.03% of its circulating supply, on Sept. 30. These tokens are designated for core contributors and investors. @TheDeFinvestor mentioned that these groups are typically the ones most likely to sell. However, @wacy_time1 expressed a more optimistic view, suggesting that the price might not react negatively. The influencer emphasized the potential of Optimism following the success of Coinbase&#8217;s Base and hinted at accumulation opportunities if any negative price reaction occurs. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond dYdX On Sept. 26, $13.7 million, about 3.8% of the dYdX circulating supply, will be unlocked. These tokens are allocated to the community treasury, liquidity provider rewards, and trading rewards. @TheDeFinvestor highlighted the mid-long term selling pressure these unlocks might introduce, while @wacy_time1 did not express significant concerns regarding this token&#8217;s unlock. Aptos (APT) A standard linear unlock of $25 million is scheduled for APT on September 12. @wacy_time1 shared that he doesn&#8217;t anticipate a significant price reaction and might consider buying APT for speculative purposes if it drops below $3. In light of these impending unlocks, the crypto community is advised to stay informed and exercise caution. The events of September are poised to offer both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Featured image from Binance, chart from TradingView.com"
