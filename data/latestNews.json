The total of $11 million from the 37 lots is more than double the high estimate, which was $4.8 million. Every single lot sold in excess of the high estimate, and that data is very impressive, says Bouhanna. </p><p>There was tremendous excitement in the lead-up to the auction. We ended up having over 1,000 bids across the entire sale and had artists like Beeple and other members of the community take to Twitter to voice their excitement about the sale of The Goose. It was a very important movement, and I think that speaks to not only the importance of the work of The Goose but also to the collection and its significance to the market. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sotheby_s-Auction-Room-for-GRAILS-Collection-Sale-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Sothebys Auction Room during Grails II\" class=\"wp-image-21547\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sotheby_s-Auction-Room-for-GRAILS-Collection-Sale-Large.jpeg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sotheby_s-Auction-Room-for-GRAILS-Collection-Sale-Large-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Sothebys Auction Room during Grails II. (Sothebys)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sothebys dates back to 1744 but only started its foray into NFTs in early 2021. Bouhanna believes the move is helping to usher in a new generation of collectors. </p><p>Since early 2021, weve been committed to digital art and NFTs as an important part of our overall fine art strategy. We really see digital art and NFTs as a natural outgrowth for us, he said.<br><br>He points out that 61% of the buyers in the Grails II auction were new to Sothebys, and most were under 40, well below the average age of its usual clientele.<br><br>With so many new collectors coming through our digital art sales, I think that is definitely opening up the world to many people who would have otherwise felt intimidated by participating in a sale at Sothebys.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/storming-the-last-bastion-angst-and-anger-as-nfts-claim-high-culture-status/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Storming the last bastion: Angst and anger as NFTs claim high-culture status</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/4-out-of-10-nft-sales-are-fake-learn-to-spot-the-signs-of-wash-trading/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><h2><strong>Constitution DAO</strong></h2><p>Sothebys is getting good at drawing attention to the NFT and crypto space via high-tension live streams. In November 2021, it was host to the sale of a first edition of the U.S. Constitution, with Constitution DAO drawing international headlines with its narrowly thwarted attempt to secure the highly sought-after artifact. </p><p>When Constitution DAO attempted to purchase the first printing, that really demonstrated how excited the community was about live auctions. Even today, it remains one of the most viewed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TBa-9Lx3vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >live streams</a> of all time. It also shows how the crypto community, the NFT and digital art community is excited about how auctions are run and how very new they are to many people in this community, says Bouhanna. </p><h2><strong>Prestige at a price</strong></h2><p>Sothebys applies the same traditional buyers premium revenue model to their digital art auctions as their physical art auctions. But Bouhanna points out the Sothebys brand helps artists attract premium prices too.<br><br>We play the same role in the market in bringing carefully created selections of our art to sale, he explains. On Twitter, there was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1669686161952890881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >poll</a> following the auction asking the question if The Goose would have achieved the same price if sold elsewhere. A significant percentage of respondents agreed that it would never have achieved as much as that amount had it been auctioned off on OpenSea or another on-chain NFT marketplace. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"591\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tweet-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21566\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tweet-2.png 591w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tweet-2-300x89.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></figure><h2><strong>Sothebys </strong>and the 99-year-old art pioneer</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vera-Molnar.png\" alt=\"Vera Molnrs example work from Themes and Variations\" class=\"wp-image-21549\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Vera Molnrs example work from Themes and Variations.

Sixty-eight percent of BTC in circulation hasn’t moved at all in the past year, <a href=\"https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-21-2023/?utm_campaign=woc_21_2023&amp;utm_medium=woc_newsletter&amp;utm_source=email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to Glassnode. There isn’t a lot of stock on the shelves for BlackRock and others to snap up, in other words. If demand exceeds supply, doesn’t that inevitably mean price gains for BTC?</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/how-smart-people-invest-in-dumb-memecoins-3-point-plan-for-success/\">How smart people invest in dumb memecoins: 3-point plan for success</a></em></strong></p><p>Also, where do retail investors fit in among the new institutional arrivals? Maybe ordinary crypto users are also needed to stabilize the price of Bitcoin. </p><p>Finally, assuming the so-called <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoins-great-accumulation-binance-us-resumes-fiat-withdrawals-and-other-news-hodlers-digest-june-18-24/\">Great Accumulation really is happening</a>, how far can it go? The cryptoverse has a market capitalization of about $1 trillion today, roughly half of which is in Bitcoin. Could the crypto market cap reach a 10-fold increase of $10 trillion in five years?</p><h2>Has the “great accumulation” begun?</h2><p>“Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1671525634131066881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671525634131066881%7Ctwgr%5E595bd1ea368f656281180406f429ed889fb931f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2023-06-20%2Fwisdomtree-files-for-us-spot-bitcoin-etf-on-heels-of-application-by-blackrock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">declared</a> Winklevoss, adding: “If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this [spot Bitcoin ETF] will likely be the most obvious and best trade of this decade.” </p><p>Is the co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange right?</p><p>“Clearly, there is significant investor demand for Bitcoin access through regulated investment funds from a broad spectrum of U.S. investors,” Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Cointelegraph, “Otherwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and other major asset managers would not have filed S-1s for Bitcoin ETFs.”</p><p>The entry of BlackRock and other investment managers into this new asset class isn’t so unexpected, either. “We’ve long known that BlackRock is enabling BTC investments for clients through their Aladdin platform and Bitcoin private fund,” Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told Cointelegraph. </p><p>The recent negative news stories swirling around Binance and Coinbase “are not related to Bitcoin and may be seen as an opportune time for a better-known, more regulated brand to provide alternatives that end-buyers can trust. A BTC ETF is a natural step.”</p><p>Winklevoss, Saylor and others warn that retail investors had better buy Bitcoin now to get its ostensibly cheaper “pre-IPO” price before BTC’s price skyrockets. Are they correct?</p><p>“There is some truth to that given the finite supply of Bitcoin and increasingly low rate of supply growth,” added Chung. “However, plenty of investors bought in the $50k to $69k range and they are still underwater; on top of that, cash earns 5%+ at the moment. To me, trying to time the market, especially one as volatile as crypto, is a fool’s errand.” </p><p>Moreover, the Winklevoss scenario “depends on how certain one is that institutions are truly coming and that the ETFs and other infrastructure plays by large institutions will play out,” Justin d’Anethan, head of business development for the Asia-Pacific region at Keyrock — a Europe-based digital asset market maker — told Cointelegraph.</p><p>“Forward-looking investors will probably try to front-run that move and buy before any of this is truly released. I’m personally a bit less certain about how soon this will happen, though,” d’Anethan added.</p><p>Assuming BlackRock succeeds in its ETF quest and other institutional investors follow, would that stabilize the price of Bitcoin at a substantially higher level than the current $30,000? Or does long-term price stability also require broad retail participation?</p><p>“It all depends how much AUM they can gather if they are approved,” answered Chung. “If it’s a substantial amount, then it stands to reason that it would lift the price substantially given the finite supply. Bitcoin and its price is agnostic as to who buys Bitcoin and through what means. Buying demand just has to outstrip selling demand and the price will appreciate.”</p><p>Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex Business School, told Cointelegraph that a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs could actually make BTC less stable and more volatile. “If there’s too many ETFs, all these market makers trying to hedge their positions could be selling at the same time or buying at the same time. It could increase volatility… I disagree with what Winklevoss said.”</p><p>Alexander has her own BTC price scenario, which assigns retail investors a key role. In March, when BTC was trading around $20,000, she predicted the coin would rise to $30,000 by June and move sideways through the summer. That has largely come to pass. “So the question is, what’s going to be happening in September?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m not saying it will — but it could go up to around $50,000. That’s because people come back after the summer, and there’s more liquidity in the markets.” </p><p>But it’s also because retail investors are no longer scared after the long string of crypto drawdowns, scandals, bankruptcies and regulatory actions of the past year. The growing investment in the digital asset market by large financial institutions like Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase has arguably had a calming effect on retail investors. </p><p>“I think we’re going to be seeing much more acceptance from really ordinary people starting in September as you get some more regulatory clarity about things. That extra volume of trades could bring the price back up to — I’m not saying $68,000 where it was, that would be too high [...] — but there’s that sweet area around the $50,000 mark, which I think will be the next long-term resistance level.”</p><p>In a June 19 global survey by Nomura Laser Digital, 90% of professional investors <a href=\"https://www.laserdigital.com/company-news/laser-digital-investor-survey-on-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> it was “important” that any digital-asset funds or investments have the backing of a large traditional financial institution — at least before considering putting their clients’ money into it. Maybe this past week’s announcements by BlackRock, Fidelity, Deutsche Bank, et al. are the signal they were waiting for.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Schwenk said. “Only time will tell. It’s hard to pick when the tipping point will be. We have had participation from other large traditional firms — BNY Mellon, State Street, Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, etc. That hasn’t been enough to satisfy the respondents in the survey yet, but eventually, they will see enough momentum.”</p><h2>Ten-fold growth over five years?</h2><p>In the medium term, how high could things go? With the active participation of large TradFi firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Deutsche Bank, could crypto market capitalization grow from $1 trillion to $10 trillion or more over the next five years, for instance? </p><p>“Five years ago, the entire market cap of liquid crypto, as measured by the CF Large Cap Index, was around $250 billion and hit a high of around $2.6 trillion in late 2021,” said Chung. “So 10X would seem to be within the realms of possibility.” </p><p>Major institutions putting their distribution networks to work to support further adoption would also provide “a significant tailwind,” he added. “However, interest rates were not 5% in that previous five-year period — they are now. What impact that might have is impossible to know.”</p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/open-source-buzzword-or-real-security-for-crypto-wallets\">Open source: Buzzword or real security for crypto wallets?</a></em></strong></p><p>Alexander was less bullish. “A Bitcoin ETF — I don’t even see that it’s needed.” Most ETFs are a basket of equities or a basket of currencies. An ETF with a basket of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) and Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) “would make a lot more sense,” in her view.</p><h2>‘Exciting times’ for Bitcoin?</h2><p>Sightings of institutional investors just outside the boundaries of the cryptoverse have been reported before, but they have never quite entered <em>en masse</em>. Why might this time be different?</p><p>“Institutional investors are very slow and thoughtful in their due diligence process,” Johns Hopkins’ Liew said, but “they have finally come to see the Bitcoin light. It’s just too exciting to pass up and their customers are pushing them for products.” From an empirical perspective, some crypto exposure is a good means of diversifying an investment portfolio, he noted, summarizing: </p><blockquote>“If institutional investors enter the party, their demand would certainly drive prices higher. It would definitely be exciting times for BTC.” </blockquote><p>“The involvement of large financial institutions, whether it be for ETF applications or the new EDX exchanges, represent a significant shift and a decisive moment for crypto markets, in the U.S. and globally,” concluded d’Anethan. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

We believe strongly in the revolutionary power of this technology, but how do we share its potential with the world? There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so blockchain advocates need to tailor their sales pitch to different audiences in order to kickstart mass adoption from the ground up.</p> <p>In a little over a decade, cryptocurrency has risen from an obscure corner of the dark web to a significant focus of many investors and institutions around the globe. Compared to traditional financial systems, however, Web3 still remains an afterthought.</p> <p>On one hand, the lack of clear crypto regulations in countries such as the U.S. remains a major hurdle. The legal gray area around Web3 currently limits the amount of overall investment activity. While constituents in the U.S. can call their representatives and urge them to pass common-sense laws around cryptocurrency, what else can people around the world do to push the blockchain world forward?</p> <h2>A holistic approach to growth</h2> <p>There are actually many areas where Web3 supporters can make a difference. In particular, private individuals and businesses can join forces to raise awareness of what blockchain is really about. Education, development and onboarding are all very powerful tools that can bring us all one step closer to a more vibrant and decentralized world.</p> <p>To increase awareness, we need different strategies for reaching different target groups. Growing this emerging digital industry isn’t just about finding more users, but also onboarding more companies and more professionals who can build useful applications. If builders of all kinds start working together more, the sky is the limit for Web3.</p> <h3><strong>Attracting developers: Offer fair rewards</strong></h3> <p>Coders play a huge role in the path to blockchain mass adoption. Talented programmers lead to more quality dApps that help bring Web3 to life. However, the search for reliable Web3 developers is very competitive. While blockchain startups might not be able to pay the same salary from day one as Web2 tech giants, they can get creative in other ways, such as offering token allocations and performance incentives.</p> <p>Grants and hackathons are also important. These events can present a perfect opportunity for promising young coders to show off their talents and secure some funding. Make sure to provide meaningful prizes so that if a hackathon participant delivers a promising minimum-viable-product, they can tap into the resources necessary to continue working on their idea. Overall, a modest investment in community builders can pay dividends down the road for the growth of Web3.</p> <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color: #fabf2c;padding: 20px 30px\">Join the community where you can transform the future. Cointelegraph Innovation Circle brings blockchain technology leaders together to connect, collaborate and publish. <strong><a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/learn-more?utm_campaign=Coin&_ga=2.123197772.699257063.1649682515-719256619.1645538730\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply today</a></strong></p> <h3><strong>Empowering businesses: Help them think differently</strong></h3> <p>While it may be fun to create branded NFTs as collector’s items, this is only one of many ways that blockchain technology can drive value for companies. NFTs, DeFi and GameFi are just scratching the surface of the vast potential of Web3, and there is still a huge opportunity for companies of all sizes to get in early on the blockchain revolution. For example, any businesses that process credit card payments can potentially <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/the-future-of-digital-payments-lies-in-web3-payment-services-says-robert-miller-of-fuse/\">downsize</a> their overhead costs by integrating Web3 solutions.</p> <p>Industries like real estate, logistics and medicine could also be the next use cases for decentralized technology. Consumer brands can even use crypto rewards as the foundation for next-generation customer loyalty systems. But whether you are a local entrepreneur or a multinational corporation, it’s not as easy as it looks to successfully transition to Web3.</p> <p>Crypto veterans need to help support and educate new businesses with the experience and know-how needed to succeed in this exciting decentralized world. To keep overhead costs down, Web2 businesses should explore streamlined and audited solutions from third-party contractors rather than developing their own blockchain products entirely from scratch.</p> <h3><strong>Onboarding users: Focus on user experience and security</strong></h3> <p>The public also needs education and user-friendly solutions in order to widely adopt blockchain technology. That can mean leveraging the power of the blockchain while making it appear invisible to end-users. Furthermore, Web3 supporters need to work together to flip the script on inaccurate narratives about crypto and demonstrate its potential and security. Every day people are motivated by economic value, but they can be hesitant to try new products unless they have peace of mind and a smooth user experience.</p> <p>One way to achieve that goal is by making the technology seamless to end users. Delivering an intuitive UX is a balancing act where developers can potentially provide the option to create their own non-custodial wallet if desired. While safely storing 12 or 24 words might not seem that difficult, it can be a barrier to onboarding non-crypto natives who are used to setting a simple password they can quickly reset at any time. A hybrid approach can help new users get started with a new dApp without having to write down a long seed phrase, while also giving them the opportunity to adapt later once they learn more about why self-custody is valuable.</p> <p>In terms of security, there are several ways to dispel the misconception that cryptocurrency isn’t safe. Two-factor authentication can help stop hackers in their tracks even if they manage to somehow access your wallet. Hardware solutions are also a useful way to minimize risk from bad actors. Education about the risks of Web3 is also crucial since scammers are always willing to exploit the knowledge gaps of new users.</p> <h2><strong>Web3 grows when we work together</strong></h2> <p>With the right funding, expertise and user experience, the blockchain revolution can uplift people from around the world in many different ways. This current moment is pivotal, as the bear market is a great time to build the foundation for onboarding the next billion users to crypto. Web3 believers must work together to provide key resources and overcome resistance from governments, banks and big corporations. By conquering these hurdles, we can help kickstart mass adoption while still maintaining the original decentralized spirit of Web3.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WRueckerl\">Wolfgang Rückerl</a> is the CEO of Istari Vision and Entity.global.
