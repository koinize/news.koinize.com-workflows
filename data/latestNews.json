Lessons from the front lines</em></strong></a></p><p>Let’s examine three of the major factors influencing today’s crypto market rally.</p><h2>Uptober is off to a solid start</h2><p>October has historically been celebrated as “<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-uptober-up-5-things-bitcoin-this-week\">Uptober</a>” due to the positive returns in the crypto market. Bitcoin and crypto market prices rallied 5% to over $28,500. </p><p>The seasonality of Bitcoin’s returns in October has remained positive, only failing to achieve gains 3 times in the month. With such a strong history, this makes October statistically one of the strongest months for Bitcoin price gains.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/532c9418-2635-4758-8158-e67e2d0c3aff.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin returns by month. Source: Look Into Bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure><p>A strong October is much needed after the third quarter of 2023 equated to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/700-m-loss-crypto-hacks-exploits-scams-q3-certik\">$700 million in losses</a> due to a variety of hacks. </p><h2>Crypto liquidations rule the day</h2><p>The crypto market rally started on Oct. 1 and fueled a wave of short position liquidations across the market, totaling over $92 million in 24-hours. Bitcoin short liquidations lead the way with the largest single liquidation of $8.39 million in one transaction on the Huobi exchange. In total, $51.5 million in Bitcoin shorts have been liquidated in 24-hours.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/670f5ccf-e493-42a2-acde-ade6d4d1ebe0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total crypto liquidations in 1-day.

Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Macro factors could benefit the crypto market </h2><p>The U.S. government <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/industry-leaders-policymakers-government-shutdown\">averting a shutdown</a> on Sept. 30, may have helped the initial Oct. 1 crypto price pump which quickly <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-price-pump-uptober-millions-short-liquidation\">wiped out $70 million</a> in shorts. </p><p>Despite the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/search?query=sec\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> refusing to approve a Bitcoin ETF and their continued war on the crypto market, large institutions remain interested in the space.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-28-5-k-trader-bitcoin-disbelief\"><strong><em>BTC price knocks on $28.5K as trader says Bitcoin ‘reeks of disbelief’</em></strong></a></p><p>Such interest has led VanEck and Bitwise to both launch Ethereum ETFs on Oct. 2. The Bitwise ETF will launch on the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitwise-announces-ethereum-etf-launch-on-october-2\">Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)</a> and the VankEck Ether ETF will launch on the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/van-eck-ethereum-strategy-etf-launches-cboe\">Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)</a>. </p><p>While Bitcoin and altcoins still have overhanging risk events that could impact the price, the growing institutional interest is improving sentiment across the market. The Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-this-week-fear-26k-key-5-things\">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a> highlights the improved sentiment, noting an 11-point increase over the last month. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/a4aecffa-42b0-4ac0-8b0f-91f740122606.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, crypto markets are likely to continue to experience price volatility. While the positive start to October is providing a nice short-term bump in crypto prices, the market’s reaction to any new enforcement actions or an economic recession will be the true determinant of the direction the market chooses to take. </p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-bloodbath-in-the-horizon-report-casts-doubt-on-recent-rally/",
    "description": "Over a billion dollars in liquidations sent the XRP price and the crypto market back from the dead and into local highs. However, new data suggests the rally might be short, pushing down the nascent sector into critical support. Related Reading: Tellor (TRB) Is Up 640% In 2023, Back To 2021 Highs Ahead of Bitcoin, XRP? As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.5 with a 4% profit in the last week. The cryptocurrency rallied in the previous 24 hours but has been retracing its steps over the past few hours, hinting at potential losses unless buyers step in and defend these levels. XRP Price Braces For Impact? According to the trading desk QCP Capital, the current rally in the crypto market coincides with seasonality. In the nascent sector, October is known as “Uptober” because major cryptocurrencies, including the XRP price, trend to the upside. In the past years, every Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price rally began in October, making it the best month for the market, as seen in the chart below. However, the trading desk warned its followers on social media X about a potential reverse that could have negative effects on cryptocurrencies: However, we are not fully convinced by this move, and we think that BTC might test super key 25k support sometime in the final quarter of 2023 (…) This aggressive bounce has been due almost entirely to exogenous factors thus far and might not have the momentum to sustain. The trading desk believes these factors may lack the power to sustain the current price action. In addition, the narrative around approving an Ethereum future Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US could set the stage for a bloodbath. Two years ago, when the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a BTC futures ETF. This event marked the crypto market&#8217;s top, making the current ETH future ETF an ominous event for XRP and the altcoin market. QCP Capital claims that the newly approved financial asset could increase selling pressure in the sector due to adding “synthetic coins” to the market. In other words, the ETH futures ETF creates a disbalance between the supply and demand forces in the sector. The firm added: We would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot price &#8211; as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into a synthetic market. Good News In The Short Term For XRP The XRP price could benefit from the US government shutdown in the macro arena. The analysis shows that in the past 30 years, each US government shutdown preceded a bull run for the financial market. This is the only positive news for the cryptocurrency in the medium term.
