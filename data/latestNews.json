In an interview, Hanke stated that these purchases were motivated by the weaponization of fiat currencies like the dollar, which has driven countries in &#8220;de-dollarization mode&#8221; to take refuge [&#8230;]"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-altcoins-this-week-crypto-analyst/",
    "description": "Miles Deutscher, a crypto analyst, recently shared insights on altcoins that are catching his attention for the upcoming week. In a post on X, he starts by noting the market&#8217;s recent cool-off, suggesting this phase is creating new opportunities for savvy investors. Deutscher also emphasizes the importance of staying informed and ready to capitalize on these shifts. Top Altcoins To Watch This Week Injective (INJ) According to Deutscher, Injective (INJ) is experiencing a lull in hype, but this should not undermine its strong performance throughout the year. He believes that if the bullish momentum continues, INJ could reach its local highs in the $19&#8217;s. &#8220;Monitoring closely, as it runs hard when it runs,&#8221; Deutscher states, highlighting the potential for rapid gains. At press time, INJ was trading at $15.88 after being rejected at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level of $17.13. Pyth Network (PYTH) Deutscher points out that PYTH is in an interesting position with attributes favored by the market: it&#8217;s a new, shiny coin with a low float and perpetual contracts. However, competition from other Solana tokens, like Jupiter and JITO, may temporarily divert attention. For those already holding PYTH, Deutscher advises to hold but not to add more unless the price drops. Related Reading: Whale Alert: Big Players Scoop Up These 4 Altcoins, On-Chain Data Indicates SuperFarm (SUPER) SUPER is part of the trending gaming narrative and has been gaining attention from significant creators and influencers. Despite its volatile funding, Deutscher sees potential for a FOMO-driven price increase. &#8220;It could be one of those &#8216;it’s already up too much, I’m not buying&#8217; plays,&#8221; he speculates, suggesting that late buyers might drive the price even higher. Cosmos (ATOM) The recent approval of the ATOM Halving proposal is a significant development for Cosmos. This change will halve the maximum inflation rate from 20% to 10%, potentially impacting ATOM&#8217;s price action (PA). Deutscher is watching this closely for signs of a developing trend. Related Reading: Market Watch: These 5 Altcoins Are Poised For Breakouts, Says Crypto Expert dYdX (DYDX) The unlocking of $524 million worth of DYDX on November 28th is a crucial event, especially since these tokens will be released on the DYDX chain, not supported by centralized exchanges (CEXs). Deutscher anticipates a complex interplay of market psychology around this event. &#8220;Watching to see if the head and shoulders pattern continues to play out,&#8221; he comments, suggesting possible price movements following the unlock. Solana (SOL) And BONK SOL&#8217;s struggle to break past $58 is noted by Deutscher, placing it in a &#8220;no trade zone&#8221; for now. However, a breakthrough could lead to significant gains. BONK, a Solana-based meme coin, is also on his radar due to its higher volatility and correlation with Solana&#8217;s movements. Vertex (VRTX) Finally, Deutscher highlights the significant volume increase on Vertex, surpassing DYDX and Uniswap. Despite suspicions of wash trading due to low open interest (OI) compared to volume, he sees potential in Vertex and perceives a resurgence in the popularity of perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
