Coinbase’s website has experienced a 15% traffic decline over the period, with the number of visits dropping from 33.5 million to 28.4 million.</p><p>A number of cryptocurrency exchange websites have had more success in terms of traffic, though. According to Similarweb data accessed by Cointelegraph, the websites of crypto exchanges OKX, HTX (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/huobi-new-name-htx-stands-for-exchange-tron-and-10th-anniversary\">formerly Huobi</a>), Gate.io, CoinW, XT.com and Bitmart have seen a notable increase in traffic year-to-date (YTD).</p><p>According to the data, monthly visits to the HTX website surged more than 200% YTD, rising from 7.3 million in January to 22 million in August. The website of OKX saw a similar traffic increase, with total monthly visits jumping 185% from 8 million in early 2023 to 22.8 million in August.</p><p>The Gate.io and Coinw exchanges saw their website traffic surge by 143% and 66% YTD, respectively. The website traffic of crypto trading platforms XT.com and Bitmart has surged about 40% this year so far, reaching more than 9.5 million monthly visits.</p><p>Kraken, a major crypto exchange in the United States, has also seen its traffic rise this year, surging about 11% from 5 million to 5.6 million YTD, according to the data.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/8635b579-20e4-4661-8253-25feb4e70250.png\"  /></figure><p>The websites of certain centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) are not the only crypto websites that have seen traffic increase this year. There is also a rising trend among some software cryptocurrency wallets as well as decentralized crypto exchanges (DEX) and other crypto services.</p><p>MetaMask, a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet\">major self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet</a>, has recorded a 31% jump in traffic, with monthly visits surging from 4.5 million visits in January 2023 to 5.9 million in August. Binance’s self-custody wallet, Trust Wallet, has also seen its traffic grow this year, edging up roughly 7% from 2.9 million to 3.1 million monthly visits.</p><p>Major DEX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-uniswap-a-step-by-step-beginner-s-guide\">Uniswap</a> has posted a 28% increase in website traffic so far this year, rising from 3.9 million visits in January to 5 million visits in August.</p><p>Cryptocurrency gift card company Bitrefill is also among the crypto websites that have experienced some traffic growth this year. By August, the Bitrefill website had reached 1 million monthly visitors, up 12% from around 900,000 monthly visits in January 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-tops-chainalysis-2023-global-crypto-adoption-index\">India, Nigeria, Thailand top Chainalysis’ 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index</a></em></strong></p><p>With many cryptocurrency websites seeing notable growth this year, this could suggest that crypto may not have been in a bear market after all. While cryptocurrency website traffic does not reflect trading volumes, it can still serve as an important indicator of adoption and demand for cryptocurrency services.</p><p>Cryptocurrency website traffic is not the only evidence that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-bitcoin-is-not-longest-ever-bear-market\">crypto is not in a bear market</a>, according to several observers.</p><p>According to one definition of a bear market, a bear trend happens when a market index or asset declines by 20% or more from its recent high.
