    "description": "StarkWare has unveiled Stwo, a new open-sourced prover based on zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to enhance proving latency and reduce transaction fees on its Starknet network. This development, revealed on Thursday at ETHDenver, is designed to generate cryptographic proofs more efficiently, a critical component in compressing transactions on Starknet. By optimizing proof generation, Stwo is expected [&#8230;]"
