The act, aimed at encouraging greater use of data resources to train algorithms, would update the EU’s rules on smart contracts to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-approves-smart-contract-kill-switch-rules-under-data-act\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/eu-approves-smart-contract-kill-switch-rules-under-data-act/amp\">include a kill switch option</a> that would allow them to be safely terminated. Obviously, this contradicts the fundamental idea of trust in smart contracts. </p><p>Meanwhile, the European Commission proposed a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-commission-aims-universal-acceptance-digital-euro-proposal\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/european-commission-aims-universal-acceptance-digital-euro-proposal/amp\">legislative plan for a digital euro</a>, aiming to make it a widely accepted and easily accessible form of payment. The announcement emphasized that allowing individuals to obtain digital euros through their banks upon request ensures easy accessibility and prevents citizens from being left behind. The proposal also includes provisions for free basic digital euro services, privacy protection and offline payments.</p><p>But it’s not all doom and gloom for crypto in the old continent, especially at local levels. For example, the National Council of Slovakia approved an amendment that will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/slovakian-parliament-approvs-lower-crypto-taxes\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/slovakian-parliament-approvs-lower-crypto-taxes/amp\">reduce personal income tax</a> on profits gained from the sale of cryptocurrencies held by the user for at least one year. The taxes will be lowered to 7%, which is a significant decrease from the current taxation sliding scale of either 19% or 25%. Payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros ($2,600) will not be taxed.</p><h2>Coinbase seeks dismissal of SEC suit, claims extraordinary abuse of process</h2><p>In the ongoing legal battle between Coinbase and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the American cryptocurrency exchange has filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s complaint. In a legal document filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Coinbase raised concerns about the SEC’s interpretation of securities laws, suggesting the agency reached beyond its legal authority.</p><p>The motion to dismiss argues that even if all the allegations in the lawsuit are true, the plaintiff does not have a valid legal claim. Coinbase’s legal team stated in the filing: “Even if the SEC were correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this [legal] action must be dismissed on independent grounds that it violates Coinbase’s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process.”</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sec-seeks-dismissal-of-sec-suit-claims-extraordinary-abuse-of-process\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sec-seeks-dismissal-of-sec-suit-claims-extraordinary-abuse-of-process/amp\"><strong>Continue reading</strong></a></p><h2>Kraken ordered by court to disclose user data to IRS</h2><p>The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California has ordered crypto exchange Kraken to turn over account and transaction information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The agency said it needed the information to determine if any of the exchange’s users had underreported their taxes. Kraken is required to provide details of users who engaged in transactions exceeding $20,000 within a calendar year, including names (real or pseudonyms), birthdates, taxpayer identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and various other documents.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-ordered-by-court-disclose-user-data-irs-tax-compliance\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-ordered-by-court-disclose-user-data-irs-tax-compliance/amp\"><strong>Continue reading</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><h2>Crypto ‘regulatory approach isn’t needed now’ in New Zealand </h2><p>Ian Woolford, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) director of money and cash, stated that “a regulatory approach isn’t needed right now,” though increased vigilance is. Accompanying Woolford’s statement was a <a href=\"https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/have-your-say/the-future-of-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">summary</a> of 50 stakeholder submissions to an earlier RBNZ paper discussing crypto and decentralized finance.

    "description": "According to on-chain data from DefiLlama, Ethereum liquid staking derivatives have grown in total value in recent months, with the total crypto locked closing in on record numbers. Liquid staking derivatives platforms now have more than 10 million ETH locked, making the total value locked (TVL) close in on $20 billion across various protocols. ETH Liquid Staking Derivatives With Ethereum 2.0 staking now live, many ETH investors have turned to liquid staking derivatives like Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking has gained massive popularity as it introduces an innovative way for ETH holders to earn a yield on their holdings while having access to funds to carry out other activities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Dominate, But Expert Warns Of Potential $20,000 Retest The top protocols are Lido, Coinbase Wrapped, and Rocket Pool, which combined have over 9 million ETH locked. Lido currently dominates the ETH liquid staking derivatives market,  holding a market share of 74.46% and having more than 7.54 million ETH staked.  Lido dominates liquid staking market &#124; Source: DeFiLlama Taking into account the current price of ETH, this amounts to a total value locked (TVL) of $14.8 billion. Lido has also witnessed a 1.86% and a 7.06% growth over the past week and month, respectively.  Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH has also seen an increase in investors, growing over 3.06% in the past week alone.  The Tranchess Ether protocol, on the other hand, has experienced the greatest growth over the previous month, increasing its total value locked by more than 375%.  ETH 2.0 Total Value Staked Surpasses $46 Billion The total amount locked in the ETH 2.0 contract has been on a steady rise since the beginning of the year. With Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, validators have to lock their digital assets through staking to participate in the consensus process and continue adding blocks to the blockchain. This has led to the growth of “liquid staking” derivatives that allow holders to stake their ETH while still maintaining liquidity.

According to data from Glassnode, a blockchain data and intelligence platform, the cumulative amount currently deposited to the ETH 2.0 contract is now at an all-time high of over $45 billion.  This amounts to over 20% of the total ETH supply now being locked in the ETH 2.0 contract. The progress made so far points to a very promising future for Ethereum and its transition to Ethereum 2.0.
