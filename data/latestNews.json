The incubator will work with “some of music’s most innovative artists, songwriters, and producers across the industry.”</p><p>This includes the composer Max Richter and singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash among others.</p><p>Mohan closed by saying he is “incredibly excited” about how AI presents opportunities to “supercharge creativity” around the world. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related:</u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/spotify-reportedly-deletes-thousands-of-ai-generated-songs\"><strong><em> </em></strong></a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-launches-suite-of-generative-ai-music-tools-rivaling-google-s-musiclm\"><strong><em>Meta launches suite of generative AI music tools rivaling Google’s MusicLM</em></strong></a></p><p>Although the YouTube CEO expressed excitement and praise for the emerging technology, he also expressed that he believes AI won’t be a replacement for human creativity.</p><blockquote>“AI will never replace human creativity because it will always lack the essential spark that drives the most talented artists to do their best work, which is intention.\"</blockquote><p>In an interview with Cointelegraph, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-grammys-recording-academy-ceo-harvey-mason-jr\">the CEO of the Grammy’s</a> echoed this sentiment and said that there is “something about the human experience and the emotion and the heart that comes from what we do and what we contribute to the music that I don’t think can be replicated yet.”</p><p>In July, the Grammy’s clarified its rules by saying that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-music-can-win-a-grammy\">music with AI components</a> is eligible for an award, depending on the use of the technology and the award category for which it is nominated. </p><p>Earlier this month on Aug. 9, Universal Music Group announced that it is in talks with Google over<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/universal-music-google-negotiate-ai-deep-fakes\"> a deal to collaborate in combating AI</a> deep fakes.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/biticulture-fine-art-on-solana-ai-music-podcast-book-reviews/\"><strong><em>BitCulture: Fine art on Solana, AI music, podcast + book reviews</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
