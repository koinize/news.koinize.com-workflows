He said Thodex was just a crypto company that went bankrupt and had no criminal intentions. A Google-translated version of Özer’s court statement read:</p><blockquote>\" I am smart enough to manage all institutions in the world. This is evident from the company I founded at the age of 22. If I were to establish a criminal organization, I would not act so amateurishly. What is in question is It is clear that the suspects in the file have been victims for more than 2 years.”</blockquote><p>The long-drawn-out case against the Thodex crypto exchange had 21 defendants out of which five attended the court hearing in person. The court acquitted 16 defendants of \"qualified fraud\" due to lack of evidence, and ordered the release of four defendants. The other defendants in the case received varying degrees of sentences based on their involvement in the fraud.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-10x-more-into-btc-4x-more-into-eth-hall-of-flame/\"><strong><em>Crypto Twitter Hall of Flame: Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton ‘10x more into BTC, 4x more into ETH</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
