    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/hedera-hbar-soars-13-doubling-soon/",
    "description": "Hedera (HBAR) has surged by 13.7% in the past 24 hours and a notable 31.5% over the last week. This uptick is part of a broader &#8220;altcoin season,&#8221; where select altcoins are experiencing significant gains. Scott Melker, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis space, today shared his insights into the altcoin market and specifically on HBAR&#8217;s potential for growth. Altcoin Market Overview Melker, also known as the &#8220;Wolf of all Streets,&#8221; has highlighted the significance of the Total 3 market cap, which excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), to gauge the health of the altcoin market. According to Melker, Total 3 reaching a new cycle high of approximately $550 billion on a weekly close is a clear indicator of a robust altcoin market poised for further expansion. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Soars 50% To Mark New 20-Month High, Fuels Bullish Price Targets He stated, “Looking at it generally gives us a clearer picture of what is happening with altcoins. [&#8230;] With that in mind, it is important to note that TOTAL 3 just made a new cycle high on the weekly close, around $550B. This indicates that the altcoin market remains healthy and likely to continue to grow.” Technical Analysis Of Hedera (HBAR) This dynamic is the basis for HBAR (1-week chart, HBAR/USDT), for which Melker&#8217;s analysis shows a very optimistic scenario. Currently, the Hedera price is challenging a significant resistance zone. Melker has identified the $0.10 level as pivotal for HBAR’s potential uptrend. This resistance zone, highlighted by Melker in red, is crucial because a consistent close above this level on the daily and weekly charts would signal a shift in momentum favoring the bulls. At press time, HBAR was trading just above this key resistance zone, with yesterday’s daily candle closing above $0.10 for the first time since May 2022. The price closed at approximately $0.1117. Melker states: HBAR is pushing hard into the key resistance zone that I discussed many months ago. To keep it more simple, a push above 10 cents should do the trick. Bulls want to see daily and weekly closes above the red zone. A retest of that zone as support would be an ideal entry. Two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are plotted on the chart: the 50-day SMA at around $0.0615, which HBAR is currently well above, and the 200-day SMA at approximately $0.1241, which is slightly above the current price action. The price positioning between the two SMAs can be interpreted as a consolidation zone where the price needs to establish a firm direction. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Shines: Record-Breaking 164 Million Daily Transactions, Market Cap Reaches $2.9 Billion Melker points out that past the $0.10 resistance zone, there appears to be minimal historical resistance until nearly a 2x increase around the $0.186 level. This lack of resistance suggests that if HBAR can maintain its position above the red zone, there is potential for a relatively unobstructed upward trajectory. “As you can see on the left of the charts, there is almost NO RESISTANCE until nearly 2x, around .186. This coin dropped hard, leaving a vacuum. It should do well if it can push through here,” Melker remarks. However, if HBAR manages to break through the $0.186 resistance zone, Melker’s final target is the blue zone around $0.25. This would net investors more than a 2x on their investment. At press time, HBAR traded at $0.10647. Featured image from Disruption Banking, chart from TradingView.com"
