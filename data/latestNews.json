    "description": "XRP price started a downside correction from the $0.580 resistance. The price could start a fresh rally unless there is a close below the $0.535 support. XRP is struggling to clear the $0.5650 and $0.580 resistance levels. The price is now trading above $0.535 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5350 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh rally unless there is a close below the $0.535 support. XRP Price Dips To Key Support In the past few days, XRP price recovered higher from the $0.520 zone. There was a move above the $0.535 and $0.550 resistance levels. However, the bears remained active near the $0.580 resistance and protected more upsides, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The recent high was formed at $0.5792 before there was a downside correction. There was a move below the $0.550 level. The price even tested the $0.535 support. A low is formed near $0.5322 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ripple’s token price is now trading above $0.535 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).

The first key resistance is near $0.5620 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5793 swing high to the $0.5322 low, above which the price could rise toward the $0.580 resistance. A close above the $0.580 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near $0.600. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.600 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.620 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.650 resistance. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.535 zone and the trend line. The next major support is at $0.5220. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5220 level, the price might accelerate lower.
