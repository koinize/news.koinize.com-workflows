The report noted that investors are becoming more discerning in the altcoin space with continued inflows into XRP and Solana.</p><p>The report revealed that there was a divergence in sentiment among traders in Europe and the United States based on regional activities. This was evident from the $16 million inflows into European crypto investment products and a $14 million outflow from U.S.-based investment products.</p><p>The regional divergence was attributed to the uncertainty around the crypto regulations and recent actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto companies.</p><p>The report revealed that the weekly trading volumes dropped below $820 million well below the average of $1.16 billion in 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-digital-asset-manager-coinshares-revenue-up-q2\"><strong><em>European digital asset manager CoinShares’ revenue up 33% in Q2</em></strong></a></p><p>The recent digital asset flow market report from CoinShares reflects the current market sentiment with bearish pressure on the market.
