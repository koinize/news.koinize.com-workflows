This would help tax authorities to track the trade of crypto-assets and the proceeds gained, thereby reducing the risk of tax fraud and evasion.”</blockquote><p>The Sep. 13 plenary session vote was the final hurdle ahead of DAC8’s passage. Going forward, E.U. member states will have until Dec. 31, 2025 to implement the rules ahead of it officially going into effect on January 1, 2026. </p><p>As Cointelegraph previously reported, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/updated-european-tax-directive-requires-reporting-on-all-crypto-asset-transfers\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/updated-european-tax-directive-requires-reporting-on-all-crypto-asset-transfers/amp\">DAC was approved in May, 2023</a> after the passage of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation. The “8” in the updated program’s title refers to its eighth iteration with each prior standing directive addressing a different facet of financial oversight. </p><p>In its current form, DAC8 adheres to the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and the legislation outlined in MiCA and, ostensibly, covers all E.U.-based cryptocurrency asset transactions. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mica-good-bad-ugly-european-union-crypto-rules\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/mica-good-bad-ugly-european-union-crypto-rules/amp\"><strong><em>MiCA: The good, the bad and the ugly of the EU’s crypto rules</em></strong></a></p><p>Some DAC8 critics have opined that it contains little to differ itself from CARF and takes oversight ability away from individual member states. </p><p>Max Bernt, chief legal officer at Blockpit, <a href=\"https://blockpit.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DAC8_Commentary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in an analysis earlier this year that such sweeping change “concerns in particular the obligation of (Reporting Crypto Asset Service Providers) to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a transferred crypto-asset is reportable or not.” They also expressed concern over possible “duplicate reporting” as lawmakers attempt to disentangle existing regulations with those planned for implementation.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "
