    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/november-to-witness-over-450m-aptos-and-avalanche/",
    "description": "The crypto market is set to experience significant token unlocks in November, with projects such as Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Hashflow (HFT) leading the way. These unlocks are anticipated to release more than $320 million worth of tokens, contributing to the overall $450 million set to enter circulating supplies in the crypto market this month. It is worth noting that such substantial releases could have immediate and long-term effects on both the price and availability of these digital assets. Related Reading: Aptos TVL Soars To A Record $74 Million, Reflecting Growing Investor Confidence Aptos And Top Players In November&#8217;s Token Release Token unlocks are events where previously locked tokens become available for trading, often increasing a project&#8217;s circulating supply. These events are critical moments for projects, as they can signal maturation and a new phase of market dynamics.  Aptos, a Layer 1 blockchain created by former Meta executives, is expected to have the most significant token unlock by value, releasing 24.8 million APT tokens, currently representing about $165.6 million at today&#8217;s price. Aptos&#8217;s upcoming unlock on November 12 is not just substantial in value but also notable for its distribution, with core contributors, investors, the community, and the Aptos Foundation all set to receive portions of the release. Meanwhile, Avalanche, another Layer 1 blockchain, is preparing for its considerable token unlock later in the month on November 24, which will see 9.54 million AVAX tokens (valued at approximately $99.3 million at today&#8217;s price) released, marking 2.7% of its circulating supply. Hashflow, a multi-chain decentralized exchange, is slated to have the largest token release by circulating supply percentage. It is poised to unlock 160.38 million HFT tokens, approximately 73.9% of its circulating supply, on November 7, injecting roughly $42 million into the market. The distribution of these tokens will span early investors, ecosystem development, the core team, and community rewards, adding another layer to the economic activities of the project. Other Notable November Token Unlocks Other projects like Optimism (OP), ApeCoin (APE), and Sui (SUI) are also scheduled for significant token unlocks this November. However, they pale in comparison to the top three in terms of value. Optimism is set to unlock 24.16 million OP tokens worth $32.4 million. Apecoin (APE) is poised for an unlock of 15.60 million APE tokens worth $19.5 million, and SUI is to unlock 34.62 million tokens valued at $14.6 million at today&#8217;s market prices.

Furthermore, out of these six tokens above set to unlock this month, Aptos and Avalanche are the top gainers. Currently, both assets are up 38% and 22%, respectively, in the past 14 days. APT trades at $6.82, down by 2% over the past 24 hours, while AVAX trades at $11.02, down by 2.7% over the same period, at the time of writing. Featured image from Unspkash, Chart from TradingView"

    "description": "Solana, the now seventh-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap, thanks to a recent runaway performance, has surpassed the $40 mark. Take a look at a close-up of the price action and see if the stampede by bulls is sustainable. Say Goodbye To Single-Digit SOL Forever Less than one year ago, Solana hit a low of under $10. Single-digit SOL proved to be too enticing for investors to pass up and it could potentially serve as a long-term bottom. The altcoin fended off a fierce selloff in June this year, but held above double digits. The higher low instilled confidence in the market, possibly considering it a valid retest of support. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breaks Multi-Month Trend As Firedancer Hits Testnet Price then pushed higher, but failed to breach resistance at $26. That is until about two weeks ago when the Ethereum-competitor took out the resistance level and has been on a tear since. As today, it smashed above $40 and set an intraday high around $46. The latest over 10% gains today cap off a nearly 100% rally in three weeks, and a full 400% off the lows. Anyone who was bold enough to buy SOL at under $10 has now made more than 4x on their investment. Solana smashes above $40 &#124; SOLUSD on TradingView.com What&#8217;s Next For Solana After Smashing Above $40? Solana has now erased all bearish price action from the FX collapse and beyond. The latest rally touched price levels not seen since August 2022. The altcoin broke out from a potential ascending triangle pattern three weeks ago and has climbed over 100% since. Objectives based on the measure rule of this pattern put the next target for SOL at around $90. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond Above that level, it is possible that Solana could revisit former all-time highs above $260. This level was last reached in November 2021, a full two years ago. Comparisons with Ethereum put SOL upwards closer to $1,000 if it follows the same previous bull market pathways. Solana&#8217;s stand out crypto market performance could be partially responsible for Ether&#8217;s muted rally thus far. But with Solana possibly meeting more resistance at this level, prices could take a pause for the time being, prompting impatient profits to roll back into ETH and other altcoins.
