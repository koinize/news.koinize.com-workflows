    "description": "<p>Crypto investing app Libertify is calling on retail investors to up their game with the launch of a new offering that provides free, AI-powered risk assessments and instant optimization proposals for their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Libertify is the creator of an AI-powered app that uses intelligent algorithms powered by neural networks to recommend portfolio adjustments, with the goal being to optimize user&rsquo;s portfolios and hedge against any risk they might be exposed to. The startup believes it can provide a valuable service to investors, given the notorious volatility of the crypto market and the instability of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With its new offering, Libertify says it will provide a free audit of the user&rsquo;s crypto portfolio, followed by an instant optimization proposal, with recommendations on the adjustments investors should make to hedge against risk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The offering works with just about any kind of digital wallet, including software wallets such as Binance, Coinbase and MetaMask, as well as hardware wallets like Ledger, Libertify said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Libertify CEO Steve Rosenblum said last year&rsquo;s crypto winter shows that it&rsquo;s time for investors to learn from the past. The company&rsquo;s portfolio audits provide investors with a unique way to scan risk exposure, he explained. The launch of its offering is well-timed too, as the market for crypto retail investors is growing rapidly. Whereas there were around 200 million crypto investors globally in 2017, that number is expected to rise to more than 1.6 billion by 2025.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an intriguing offering that will enable retail investors to benefit from the same kind of risk management solutions that were previously only available to the biggest banks and financial institutions, Libertify said. Until now, retail investors have always had to rely on their own insights and abilities to analyze the crypto market, but this approach is fraught with danger. As Rosenblum explains, by following their instincts, investors often make irrational choices, increasing the chance of them suffering considerable losses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Libertify&rsquo;s AI-powered recommendations and proposals enable crypto investors to better protect themselves against market volatility, while still holding onto the assets they believe in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Crypto users buy tokens based on their beliefs and hopes, often forgetting that the crypto market is a turbo of volatility,&rdquo; Rosenblum said. &ldquo;Simple and efficient, our industry-first AI risk management solution brings new hope for all self-directed investors still shocked by the last crypto crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The capabilities of Libertify&rsquo;s app were validated earlier this year when it was announced as the winner of the Paris leg of the Fast Track Hong-Kong FinTech, a prestigious annual contest for fintech and wealthtech startups that provides opportunities to secure funding and mentorships from some of Hong Kong&rsquo;s biggest financial firms. Having won that leg, Libertify will face off against 11 other startups in November&rsquo;s grand finale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "United States Republican Patrick T. McHenry, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has released a statement calling for the need to pass the Stablecoin Bill in the wake of PayPal’s launch of its own stablecoin PYUSD.  The Call For A Stablecoin Law According to the statement, McHenry believes stablecoins are the “pillar of our 21st-century payments system.” However, they must be regulated to reach their full potential.  Related Reading: TRON’s Justin Sun Reassures Crypto Community That Huobi Exchange Is Solvent  Part of the statement read: This announcement [Paypal’s PYUSD Launch] is a clear signal that stablecoins—if issued under a clear regulatory framework—hold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system,” said Chairman McHenry. “Clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That’s why it’s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.&#8221; McHenry also recognizes the role of Congress in providing regulatory certainty to the crypto industry and the need to enact these laws that can keep the US at the “forefront of digital innovation.&#8221; The bipartisan Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act recognizes the strong role that states have played in regulating digital asset firms and builds on successful state regimes, like New York’s. We are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job. The bipartisan Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which was advanced by the House Financial Services Committee last month, is a legislative framework that seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Many will be hoping that this bill could spearhead the passing of other crypto-related bills.  PayPal Continues Journey Into Web3 On August 7, payment platform PayPal announced the launch of its dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal (PYUSD), in collaboration with Paxos (Paxos also happens to be the issuer of Binance’s BUSD). This is part of Paypal’s efforts to increase its Web3 offerings as the company believes that fully-backed, regulated stablecoins can transform payments in the Web3 space. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale $4.5 Million Burn Shocks ETH Community, What’s Going On? &#8220;The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,&#8221; said Paypal’s President and CEO Dan Schulman. &#8220;Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221; This isn’t Paypal’s first attempt at launching a stablecoin. In 2021, the company explored the possibility of launching a stablecoin but faced a setback following heightened regulatory scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Total market cap sitting at $1.125 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Featured image from History Computer, chart from Tradingview.com"
