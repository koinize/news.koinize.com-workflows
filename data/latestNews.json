So it's 10 to 15 times faster for typical computations than EVM.”</blockquote><p>According to Felten, the benefit of supporting legacy languages is the amount of code that already exists written in languages such as Rust which is already “battle-tested and audited.”</p><p>Felten identified Rust as a language that was designed to help catch development errors, with its tools being “really good at reducing the odds that you'll introduce a bug in your code.”</p><blockquote>“You can just use it. Now you can use that directly on-chain. You're gonna build less from scratch and you're gonna be able to take better advantage of things that other people have done.”</blockquote><p>Felten also highlighted the gas cost was 10 to 15 times lower, which allows for “more complex stuff [to be] done in the same transaction” and opens up the possibility of being able to perform iPhone-compatible cryptography.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-asset-management-system-launches-arbitrum-optimism\"><strong><em>Decentralized asset management system launches for Arbitrum, Optimism</em></strong></a></p><p>Felten explained that iPhones use a different digital signature standard than Ethereum, which is not supported well, so “cryptography on Ethereum that’s compatible with the iPhone has an extremely high gas cost.”</p><blockquote>“But in Stylus, you can drive that down so it becomes really feasible. It’s not prohibitively expensive.”</blockquote><p>This could give way to having a crypto wallet integrated on an iPhone — unlocking the ability to use Apple’s FaceID to verify wallet transactions similar to bank card purchases.</p><p>Other use cases Felten saw with the lower gas fees were higher levels of realism in blockchain-based games and the on-chain evaluation of machine learning models against live application data.</p><p>Ultimately, Felten thought Stylus could help burgeoning projects ship faster as allowing for mature programming languages means they may be better protected against bugs, and errors along with having extra performance.</p><p>“You don't have to squeeze out every last tiny bit of performance in your code and that also reduces a lot of friction for developing protocols.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">Additional reporting by Andrew Fenton. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-major-shibarium-upgrades-shib-retracement/",
    "description": "In a recent blog post, Kaal Dhairya, one of the key developers behind Shibarium, the layer 2 protocol of the Shiba Inu network, revealed a series of significant upgrades aimed at bolstering the network&#8217;s capabilities. The announcement comes at a time when Shibarium has crossed the 1 million wallet mark, a milestone that underscores its growing adoption and utility. &#8220;First of all, congratulations to the ShibArmy for reaching a milestone of 1 million wallets and soon, 1 million transactions. We have achieved—and aim to maintain—our status as one of the fastest and cheapest L2 networks out there,&#8221; said Dhairya. Upgrades And Progress On Shibarium One of the most notable updates is the integration of a hosted version of the Blockscout explorer on Shibariumscan. Dhairya emphasized the importance of this development, stating, &#8220;This allows our small yet dedicated protocol team to focus on the network and its upgrades, while the fantastic Blockscout team ensures the explorer remains operational and the chain is 100% indexed.&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Faces Potential Loss As Bearish Pattern Emerges The Blockscout integration also serves as a tool for developers to &#8220;Do Your Own Research&#8221; (DYOR) and verify new or existing contracts deployed on Shibarium. Dhairya urged developers to make use of the Blockscout contract verification system, as the team plans to promote projects built on top of Shibarium in the near future. He also unveiled the verified WBONE contract. Shibarium has also expanded its token bridge capabilities, adding support for several new tokens, including USDT, USDC, DAI, WBTC, and XFUND. &#8220;We are also collaborating with numerous third-party bridges to ensure they can assist in bridging many other tokens into Shibarium,&#8221; Dhairya added. Moreover, the Shibarium team plans to renounce the Bone contract and add more validators to the network in the coming week. &#8220;Shibarium is open for everyone to develop upon. The SHIB team&#8217;s primary focus in the future will be to innovate and build technologies on top of Shibarium, empowering our community to lead a self-sovereign life,&#8221; Dhairya concluded. Shiba Inu Price Retracement Could Continue The recent upgrades to Shibarium come amidst a period of retracement for the SHIB token. After peaking at a 4-month high of $0.00001195 on August 12, the meme coin is on a downward trajectory. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Sends Important Message To SHIB Holders In the 1-day chart, SHIB slipped below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000796 yesterday. This level has served as extremely strong support on the daily chart since mid-August. The drop below the level could now mean that SHIB retraces lower to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000688. At the current price of $0.00000771, this could mean another 10% slide. However, if the bulls surprisingly manage to turn the tide, the price level of $0.00000796 would be the first important step. To retake the mid-August high, SHIB will have to overcome a maze of resistances, notably the 20, 50 and 100-day EMAs, all of which lie ahead of the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00000872. If SHIB manages to overcome this price on a daily basis, it would be a strong bullish sign. Then, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000921 would be another tough challenge.
