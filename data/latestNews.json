Called “Off Exchange,” the new system allows institutional traders to swap tokens without first depositing them on the exchange. Fireblocks claimed this system would help to eliminate counterparty risk on centralized exchanges and prevent future FTX-like collapses.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, we’re excited to launch Off Exchange, a new solution that enables trading firms and asset managers to truly eliminate exchange counterparty risk. Read on → <a href=\"https://t.co/FLl3AufE0s\">https://t.co/FLl3AufE0s</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/s4P5kyNy3O\">pic.twitter.com/s4P5kyNy3O</a></p>&mdash; Fireblocks (@FireblocksHQ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FireblocksHQ/status/1729523029800047015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Fireblocks co-founder and CEO Michael Shaulov explained how Off Exchange works. He said it allows trading firms to deposit assets to a “shared” or “interlocked” MPC wallet, whose <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/multi-party-computation-could-offer-increased-protection-for-crypto-wallets\">private key</a> comprises three shards. The first shard is held by the trading firm, the second by the exchange, and the third is “triggered by an oracle.” For a transaction in this wallet to be confirmed, two out of three shards must be used to sign the transaction. This means that neither the trader nor the exchange can unilaterally withdraw assets. </p><p>Under most circumstances, transactions are confirmed when the exchange and trader sign the transaction, Shaulov explained. But if either the trader or exchange is unresponsive for a period of time, the third-party oracle can provide a second signature under certain conditions. “For example, one of the conditions is that if the exchange is hacked and it’s unresponsive for a certain period of time, then the trader can basically get back the principal without the approval of the exchange,” Shaulov stated.</p><p>According to the announcement, Off Exchange has already been implemented by institutional trading firms QCP Capital, Blocktech and Zerocap, which are using it to trade on the Derebit centralized exchange. In the coming months, the team plans to roll out support for other exchanges, including HTX, Bybit, Gate.io, WhiteBIT, BIT, OneTrading, Coinhako, and Bitget. Off Exchange is currently only available for institutions, Shaulov confirmed to Cointelegraph.</p><p>Centralized crypto exchanges have been plagued by issues of counterparty risk throughout their history. In 2014, users <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-mess-that-was-mt-gox-four-years-on\">lost over $473 million in Mt. Gox</a>, when deposits they made to the exchange were stolen through a cybersecurity exploit. In 2018, Canadian crypto exchange Quadriga shut down without returning users’ funds, resulting in over $169 million in losses to users. The exchange was later accused by regulators of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-deceased-quadrigas-founder-committed-fraud\">being a Ponzi scheme</a>. In 2021, investors lost approximately $8 billion when crypto exchange FTX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-us-suspends-withdrawals-according-to-on-chain-data\">stopped processing withdrawals</a>. The exchange is now going through bankruptcy and its CEO has been <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-found-guilty-on-all-charges\">convicted of fraud</a>.</p><p>In its announcement, Fireblocks claimed that Off Exchange will help to prevent incidents like these, which it said “stem from the unique structure of the crypto trading market, where exchanges play the role of both a custodian and trading venue.” This issue will be avoided by “locking funds in secure MPC-based shared wallets,” it stated.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/analyst-thinks-dot-will-reclaim-former-glory-with-polkadot-2-0/",
    "description": "DOT, the native currency of Polkadot, a smart contract platform, remains under pressure, posting sharp losses after soaring to an all-time high of around $55 in 2021. The coin is trading at about $6, volatile but up roughly 45% from 2022 lows, buoyed by the broader recovery across the crypto scene. Will DOT Break Above Immediate Resistance Levels? Despite DOT&#8217;s woes, one crypto trader, @Ashcryptoreal, is bullish on the coin&#8217;s prospects, pointing to the eventual implementation of Polkadot 2.0, a critical update for the cross-chain network. Taking to X on November 27, the crypto trader believes that Polkadot 2.0 will fix present issues plaguing the smart contract platform.  Specifically, Polkadot 2.0 represents an overhaul set to introduce several enhancements that could, if executed as stated, propel DOT above current resistance levels. With rising DOT demand, the coin, and by extension, the platform, could soar, rising to its former glory as one of the leading blockchains with dense user activity.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets Close To 500,000% in 24 Hours Looking at price action, DOT is moving within a broad horizontal range with caps at around $3.5 and $7.5. Despite the recent spike, which saw the coin roar by 45%, prices are moving inside the bull bar of early November.  Based on this, there must be a sharp expansion from spot levels above $5.6 with rising trading volumes for buyers to be in charge. Even so, the current formation still favors buyers. What&#8217;s The Big Deal About Polkadot 2.0 Polkadot 2.0 overhauls certain features as it is currently in the network. However, most importantly, analysts observe that proposed changes could enhance the network&#8217;s capabilities and attract more developers.  After the update, Polkadot will migrate from the dynamic block space allocation system, allowing developers to purchase block space as needed, either in bulk or individually. This flexibility could make the network more appealing to various projects. Additionally, Polkadot 2.0 will introduce elastic cores, enabling the network to adapt to varying computing demands depending on use. This adaptability may make the network more efficient. Moreover, it adapts to the diverse needs of developers. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When The concept of coretime, which measures computing resource demands, will be a notable addition to Polkadot 2.0. Like in EOS, resources in &#8220;core time&#8221; will be purchased through auctions or pay-as-you-go basis, allowing developers more control. Analysts expect these changes to increase the demand for DOT since the coin serves as a medium of exchange. All on-chain transactions are settled in DOT.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
