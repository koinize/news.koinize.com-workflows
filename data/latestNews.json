    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-fear-greed-index-highest/",
    "description": "The Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has risen to its highest level in almost three years, hitting Extreme Greed at rocket speed. Using past performance and indicators, it is possible to deduce where the BTC price is headed next after reaching this new milestone. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index At New 2-Year High The Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is a measure of investor sentiment and how they are looking at the market. This can help to figure out if investors are currently putting money into the market or if they are taking money out of it. Related Reading: OG Ethereum ERC-404 Token PANDORA Is Rallying Again, What’s Behind It? There are five major categories across the Fear &#38; Greed Index, including Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, and Extreme Greed. The index is ranked on a scale of 0-100, with a range of numbers representing a category of investor sentiment. Extreme Fear is the lowest on this scale, which ranges from 0 to 25. Then, from 26 to 46, we have the Fear. Both of these categories indicate an unwillingness of investors to enter the market and have often presented as the best time to invest in crypto. Next on the scale is 47 to 52, which represents the Neutral territory. Then 53 to 75 is Greed when investors are beginning to feel confident in the market. Finally, 76 to 100 is Extreme Greed, which represents peak bullishness. As the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index currently sits at 79, which is Extreme Greed, it could carry some implications for the market. BTC price pushes toward $57,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Extreme Greed Marks The Top? Just as the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index can be helpful in determining what is a good time to buy, it can also provide pointers for when a market top might be in. Looking through the historical performance of the crypto market compared to the Fear &#38; Greed Index, we see a persistent correlation between peak euphoria and the market top. Related Reading: The Polygon Vesting Contract Is Officially Empty, Will This Send MATIC Price To $3? The most recent example of this is November 2021, when the index’s score climbed to as high as 84, just 5 points shy of the current 79 score. At this point, the price of Bitcoin had risen to $69,000 before meeting resistance, which it will eventually succumb to, In the following days, sentiment would begin turning, as did the price of Bitcoin. A similar pattern was also seen in February and March 2021 when the index hit a high of 94. The next few days saw interest taper off, marking the peak at that particular point. If the same pattern were to be repeated in this scenario, then Bitcoin could have another few days of runway before it blows off top. Presently, the cryptocurrency is already seeing significant resistance at $57,000, which could suggest that the top is near.
