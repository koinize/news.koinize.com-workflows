On that day, its owner began with a cautionary transfer of 1 ETH to a new <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd78945003b091edb48ea10f7c76b26f31651da13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wallet</a>. One minute later they transferred the remaining 7,999 ETH to the new wallet address.</p><p>At the time of writing, the ETH stash is worth approximately $14.7 million.</p><p>This transaction was first noticed by blockchain analytics service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lookonchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lookonchain</a>, which informed its 219,000 Twitter followers of the transfer.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years woke up today.<br><br>He transferred all 8000 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ETH</a>($14.7M) to a new address.<a href=\"https://t.co/1griKB9Te9\">https://t.co/1griKB9Te9</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1bvQh3zsqY\">pic.twitter.com/1bvQh3zsqY</a></p>&mdash; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1662696913433669632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In the comments section of the post, there was some community speculation around the reason for the transfer. One commenter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GemYardBTC/status/1662697047852736518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> that the owner had just been released from prison, while another made a humorous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xMostdope/status/1662704178970648576\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">remark</a> that they were transferring funds from an old Ledger — a pointed comment about the company’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-recover-paused-code-will-open-source\">controversial new Recover upgrade</a>. </p><p>At the time, the 8,000 ETH was purchased at a price of just $0.31 per token, which places the initial investment amount at around $2,500. </p><p>At today’s prices of $1,917, this marks a staggering 590,000% gain for the owner. </p><p>This isn’t the only ICO-era Ether wallet to re-awaken in recent months. On April 24, another <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x825309a7d45d1812f51e6e8df5a7b96f6c908887\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wallet</a> which received 2,365 ETH ($4.5 million) made its first transaction in nearly 8 years, after the owner transferred just 2,360 ETH to a new wallet address. </p><p>On March 5, another ETH <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8c2e764516b633368cda857b285b42fefdf3242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wallet</a> transferred 10,226 ETH ($19.6 million) out to new wallet address after remaining dormant for five years.</p><p>The new wallet address is also one with little in the way of any significant transaction history. The only other ETH transaction recorded in the new wallet is a 207 ETH ($380,000) incoming transaction that was made just a few minutes prior to the most recent transfer. Notably, the additional 207 ETH were sent from another <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f9f416a3cfc101dcb332088132ade5c0c90d0a5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wallet</a> that remained completely inactive since June 12, 2017.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-based-jimbos-protocol-hacked-losing-7m-in-ethereum\"><strong><em>Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol hacked, losing $7.5M in Ether</em></strong></a></p><p>Interestingly, the new wallet also contains $46 worth of a memecoin called Gensler (GENSLR), and just $0.24 worth of a dragon-inspired token called Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA), according to <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xd78945003b091edb48ea10f7c76b26f31651da13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">data</a> from Web3 wallet tracker DeBank. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-05/fc8defb1-62e9-464c-a583-f31518b33c20.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total allocation of token holdings in the owner’s new wallet.

The first stage was the pre-sale, and between July 22 and Sept. 2, 2014 the sale of Ethereum tokens to new investors raised $18 million. The going exchange rate for the pre-sale was 1 BTC — for 2,000 ETH. The second stage was the official launch of the Ethereum blockchain which occurred on July 30, 2015. This meant that some investors waited more than a year to be able to redeem and use their ETH. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/more-ancient-bitcoins-leave-from-its-wallet-after-10-year-hibernation\">Dormant wallets</a> with vast sums of crypto can awaken for a variety of reasons. Sometimes dormant wallets reawaken because <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ongoing-solana-based-wallet-hack-has-already-seen-millions-drained\">they’ve been hacked</a>. Other times, it's simply because the owner may have forgotten about it and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wake-up-call-bitcoin-wallets-move-3-500-btc-dormant-since-2011\">upon its re-discovery</a>, have decided that it's possibly a good time to sell. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-city-guide-osaka-japan/\"><strong><em>Crypto City: Guide to Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest city</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
