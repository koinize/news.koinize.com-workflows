A tie between gold and Bitcoin,” Hayes continued. </p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects.”</blockquote><h2>Another path toward $1 million BTC price</h2><p>Where would that leave the BTC price?</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-undoubtedly-bullish-30k-bitcoin-buyers\">BTC price remains ‘undoubtedly bullish’ as $30K Bitcoin buyers emerge</a></em></strong></p><p>From around $30,000 today, the real effect of AI should kick in in around three years’ time.</p><p>After that, Hayes says, it could be around another decade before the network value boost from AI alone sends BTC/USD to nearly $1 million.</p><p>“I believe the peak of deranged growth investing will occur in the 2025 to 2026 timeframe. Therefore, the goal of my predictions regarding the future price of Bitcoin is to form a narrative that takes hold before then,” he explained.</p><p>Depending on the scale of that investing, BTC price action could see up to $760,000 per coin.</p><p>“Remember – the market will overpay for Bitcoin network growth if it believes there is a possibility that my assumptions could be true in the future,” part of “Massa” concludes. </p><blockquote>“The most money is made when the market price adjusts from ‘can never happen’ to ‘maybe could happen.’</blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/c2274cdc-d607-493d-9d4a-d4ef956ece61.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitcoin price target calculation (screenshot).

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-address-creation-spikes-adoption-on-the-rise/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows that the Ethereum network has been observing high address creation recently, a sign that adoption could be going up. Ethereum Network Growth Has Registered High Values Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH&#8217;s network growth has now hit its highest level in around four months. The &#8220;network growth&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of new addresses that are being created on the Ethereum blockchain. When the value of this metric is high, it means that a large amount of new addresses are coming online on the network. New addresses may be considered analogous to new users joining the chain, so this kind of trend can be a sign that the cryptocurrency is observing high adoption at the moment. On the other hand, low values of the indicator can imply not many new investors are coming to the network as there aren&#8217;t many new ETH addresses being created. Such a trend can be a sign that the asset isn&#8217;t looking very attractive to the general public currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum network growth over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum network growth has been observing a rise recently. This would suggest that addresses are being created at increasingly faster rates right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Slip, Holders Not Interested In Selling? Generally, adoption picks up during periods of high price volatility as the investors usually find such price action exciting, and so, the network growth indicator can register a spike. Recently, however, the asset&#8217;s price has been mostly moving sideways below the $1,900 level, making it interesting that the indicator has been going up nonetheless. Perhaps the general investors saw the rally that lead up to this period of consolidation and now think that it may pick up again eventually. During the past week alone, the metric has seen a combined value of 550,800, meaning that 550,800 new addresses have just been created on the Ethereum network in this period. Usually, adoption can have a constructive effect on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price, as it shows increasing interest in the asset, which is generally also accompanied by an influx of more capital into the coin. Related Reading: Solana Registers 20% Rise In Past Week, But Can SOL Keep This Up? Though, the impact from such a growth in the network doesn&#8217;t usually immediately appear; the effect on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap may be visible in the long term. Still, the adoption accelerating while the rally has slowed down to a crawl can be a positive for those hoping to see the price surge restart, as it at least means that interest in the asset hasn&#8217;t died down yet. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, down 1% in the last week. ETH has been mostly moving sideways recently &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
