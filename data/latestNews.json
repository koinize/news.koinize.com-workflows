An integrated risk-management framework should be in place starting at the research stage, and security should be designed into a CBDC, the report said.</p><p>Risks associated with CBDCs will vary across countries, as conditions and goals vary, and they will change across time, requiring continual management. These risks can be broken down into categories and a wide array of individual factors, the study demonstrated. The risks grow with the scale and complexity of the CBDC. In addition:</p><blockquote>“A key risk are [sic] the potential gaps in central banks' internal capabilities and skills. While many of the CBDC-related activities could in principle be outsourced, doing so requires adequate capacity to select and supervise vendors. […] A number of operating risks for CBDC stem from human error, inadequate definitions or incomplete planning.” </blockquote><p>Cybersecurity may be challenged by other countries, hackers, users, vendors or insiders. The study identified 37 potential “cyber security threat events” from eight specific risks.
