Li noted:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“At present, there is no clear goal [from our firm] to create an ETF with the theme of virtual assets, but it has paid close attention to the development of related asset classes, and is examining the possibility of deploying virtual currencies in existing investment products.”</p></blockquote><p>According to figures provided by Li, the total AUM of Hong Kong crypto ETFs grew by 80% compared to Dec. 2022, with a daily trading volume of $1.7 billion HKD. This represents 6% of the daily trading volume of all stocks on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The SAR previously allowed the listing of crypto ETFs in July 2022, which initially struggled in traction.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><h2 id=\"h-binance-co-founder-warns-of-altcoin-rout\">Binance co-founder warns of altcoin rout</h2><p>On July 2, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sec-calls-etf-filings-inadequate-binance-loses-euro-partner-and-other-news-hodlers-digest-june-25-july-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Binance</a> co-founder and former Chinese television host Yi He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heyibinance/status/1675374568456835072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >warned</a> “please don’t trust the community’s trading signals [that] blindly chase higher prices,” noting the price of major altcoins “have fallen by 80% to 90%” in recent times. The warning came just days after the exchange listed MAV, a permissionless decentralized finance token, and offered perpetual MAV contracts at 20x leverage.</p><p>Launched in March of this year, Maverick boasts an advanced automated market maker liquidity provider network, securing a $9 million founding round in June. The protocol is backed by prominent names such as Jump Crypto, Pantera Capital, Circle, and Gemini. Since its launch, the protocol has reached nearly $55 million in total value locked.</p><p>Shortly after the listing, MAV skyrocketed to $1.98 a piece on Binance before slumping to $0.43 apiece at the time of publication, which is still significantly above its initial listing price of $0.05. She wrote:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“According to the history of previous cycles, the first day of IEO [Initial Exchange Offering] is several times [return], and it is not in line with the current market situation to pull it up to 10 times or 20 times [return]. Please DYOR [Do Your Own Research]</p></blockquote><p>Amid the retail frenzy, the Binance co-founder also warned, “The price of tokens is not controlled by Binance. The price is affected by both buyers and sellers. Please pay attention to investment risks.” Despite a thaw in crypto markets, the marketcap of coins and tokens excluding Bitcoin, has remained stagnant over the past year at around $550 billion.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/whatever-happened-eos-community-aims-grassroots-comeback/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Whatever happened to EOS?
