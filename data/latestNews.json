The requirement is part of the infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021 by President Joe Biden, and seeks to reduce the size of the tax gap in the United States. Upon completion of a transaction, brokers must provide the tax agency with the sender’s name, address and social security number within 15 days.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/bridge-trade-injective-inj-network/",
    "description": "Injective is a blockchain designed specifically for finance. It is an interoperable and environmentally-friendly layer 1 blockchain that supports advanced DeFi applications, including crypto trading dApps, like spot and derivative exchanges, and lending protocols. That being said, in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, the Injective Network has emerged as a trailblazing force, revolutionizing the landscape with its innovative approach to scalability and seamless trading experiences. In my opinion, I will say that Injective is trying to follow the Solana path in terms of progressive growth in the ecosystem and price value.  In this in-depth guide, we&#8217;ll navigate through the essential features of the Injective (INJ) Network, unravel the intricacies of initiating your trading journey, and explore various methods to acquire and trade the coveted Injective Coin (INJ). Solving Scalability: The Essence of Injective (INJ) Network The scalability challenge has long been a hurdle for widespread crypto adoption, and Injective Network steps up to the task as a groundbreaking solution. Scalability is the reason some people don’t trade certain coins. For instance, I avoid making certain Ethereum transactions because of the high gas fees. If I want to make any monetary transaction, I prefer to use a more scalable coin like injective (INJ). Related Reading: BlackRock $10 Million Bitcoin Purchase Will Happen Today, Expert Says SEC Is Backed Into A Corner Scalability isn&#8217;t just about transaction costs but also about the speed of transactions. Injective Network boasts a remarkable transaction speed of 0.8 seconds, leaving competitors, including Ethereum and its layer 2 counterparts, in the rearview mirror. What more can you ask for with their gas fees as low as $0.01, Injective Network brings unparalleled efficiency to the world of blockchain transactions. Injective (INJ) gives you a better DeFi experience, this is because you are not scared of exploring the DeFi space due to high gas fees and slow annoying transaction speed. If you have transacted on the Ethereum chain or done any past DeFi activity on the Ethereum chain, you will be conscious of your exploration because each activity will incur a transaction fee whether the contract signed is successful or not and it’s not cheap. Initiating Your Injective Trading Journey Embarking on your trading journey within the Injective Network involves meticulous steps to ensure a seamless experience. The choice of a compatible wallet is paramount, and here, we delve deeper into two main types: EVM Based Wallets: EVM compatibility is the bedrock for smooth integration with Injective Network. While Metamask is a popular choice, it&#8217;s essential to understand its intricacies, especially when it comes to the EVM chain. Exploring alternative EVM-based wallets can provide tailored solutions for optimal user experience. Related Reading: Dogecoin Volume Explodes 190% But DOGE Price Remains Low, What’s Going On? It is preferable to use an EVM wallet like Metamask if you are bridging from an EVM chain to an injective chain. As we go further into this post, you will learn how to bridge from EVM to the injective chain. EVM wallet like metamask makes your Defi experience on the injective easier but you can&#8217;t compare it to that of the cosmos-based wallet.  Cosmos Based Wallet: For a user-friendly experience on your PC, consider Cosmos-based wallets like Leap and Keplr. These Chrome extensions are tailor-made for Injective Networks, ensuring not just compatibility but also enhanced security features. Using a Cosmos-based wallet makes interaction far easier than EVM-based wallets. But you can&#8217;t have EVM-based assets on this wallet, this means that you can&#8217;t bridge EVM assets to injective using this wallet, you need to use Metamask.  Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Spike As Ripple Enters Another $1.5 Trillion Industry These wallets, the EVM-based wallets, and the Cosmos-based Based Wallets are great for your smooth Defi experience when interacting on the injective chain. Acquiring Injective Coin (INJ) Once your wallet is set up, the next crucial step is acquiring the prized Injective Coin. INJ is prominently listed on various centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Bybit, OKX, and Gate.io. Each exchange offers its unique advantages, and strategic users may explore multiple platforms for optimal trading conditions. &#160; Consider securing your INJ in a Keplr wallet for efficient portfolio management. When you are sending INJ from centralized crypto exchanges to your Keplr wallet, make sure you choose the Injective network and paste your Injective network address from your Keplr wallet. Setting Up Keplr Wallet for Injective Chain Visibility Creating a Keplr wallet is a straightforward process through the Chrome extension. Get your Keplr wallet, and create a new wallet, you will be given a seed phrase, save the seed phrase, usually a 12 or 24-word seed phrase. Do not forget to save them, in order not to lose your account permanently. To make the Injective chain visible in your Keplr wallet, follow these steps: Click on the hamburger sign in the top left corner. Navigate to &#8220;Manage Chain Visibility.&#8221; Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Jump In January – Here’s The Target This will take you to where you can view the chain visibility on the Keplr wallet, this is essential as it helps you select other chains on the Keplr wallet. Search for &#8220;Injective&#8221; or &#8220;Inj&#8221; and click on &#8220;Add Token.&#8221; By enhancing Injective-related keywords in your wallet setup process, you not only optimize for search engines but also ensure clarity for users seeking to manage their INJ effectively. It is important to know that every address on the injective chain starts with the “inj” prefix, this helps you identify the injective chain easily. Congratulations you are about to begin your Injective DeFi journey.  Defi means Decentralised Finance, this is a type of transaction that doesn&#8217;t require a centralized platform like Binance, Bybit, OKX, or whatever centralized exchange you know. All you need to perform a DeFi transaction is a DEX (Decentralised Exchange) wallets like Keplr and a Dapp (Decentralised Application). Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Crash Almost 50%, Shiba Inu Price Wobbles We have a wallet now, we need to fund it with INJ before interacting with a Dapp on the Injective wallet. You can get INJ tokens from an exchange like Binance Binance. You can deposit on your Binance in whatever way you are used to depositing on your Binance, you can deposit USDT with fiat. Trade the USDT for INJ. The next step is to withdraw the INJ to your Keplr wallet. Withdraw the INJ on the Injective wallet. Withdrawing INJ coin and Bridging Tokens: The withdrawal process after acquiring INJ involves selecting the coin, choosing the Injective chain, and pasting your Keplr Injective address. Remember the address has to start with “INJ”. This step is crucial for securing your assets, and benefits from additional details regarding security measures, transaction confirmation times, and potential challenges users might encounter. This is just one method to get INJ from a centralized exchange, you can also get INJ by bridging.  Bridging, an alternative method for bringing tokens to Injective, is an essential strategy, especially for users keen on optimizing their portfolio across multiple chains. Bridging from an EVM-based wallet requires a metamask and INJ on an EVM chain. For instance, if you have INJ on the ETH chain in your metamask, all you need to do is connect your metamask to the Injective Bridge platform. This will help you bridge from the ETH chain to the injective chain. Bridging Tokens in the Cosmos-Based Wallet Ecosystem: An intriguing method to diversify your portfolio involves bridging tokens from the Cosmos-based wallet ecosystem to Injective. For example, bridging TIA (Celestia) to Injective and swapping TIA (Injective) to INJ (Injective) using Astroport opens up opportunities within the Cosmos ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says Cardano Rivals XRP Community, But Why Is ADA Price Struggling? You will have to go to the Injective Bridge platform, connect to your cosmos-based wallet, select whatever cosmos-based wallet token you have like TIA (Celestia), and bridge from the Celestia chain to the injective chain. Emphasizing this integration showcases the versatility of Injective Network and its compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems. Now you have TIA(Injective) you need to swap it to INJ, trading or swapping can be done Astroport. Trading INJ on Astroport Astroport, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Injective chain, serves as the epicenter for token swaps. After successfully bridging tokens, users can initiate trades on Astroport, leveraging the platform&#8217;s decentralized nature for portfolio diversification. Whatever you are swapping here is expected to be on the injective chain, you can swap INJ for all the available tokens, and now you can trade as easily as you like. How To Trade on Coinhall Coinhall is a site where you can bridge directly and swap. It is a multi-token bridge swap DEX that you can use to bridge and swap at the same time but only for Cosmos-based tokens and coins. It serves as a smart chart for all cosmos-based tokens including injective and also for swapping and bridging.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Blasts $20,000 XRP Price Target, Reveals Why It’s Impossible You can see all the available coins and tokens with their respective prices here, it&#8217;s a good DEX dApp to use. You can scroll here and search for the token you are looking for. You can also search by using the search bar.  If you want to trade a token and you can find it on the list, all you have to do is go to Coinhall and type the name of the token, as well as search using a contract address. Coingecko is also a good site that has the details of coins. Here, you can search for the name of the coin or token you are looking for, and get the contract address directly.  Go to the info section and search for the contract, copy the smart contract from Coingecko, and paste it into the coinhall market search button.  Like this: This will take you to where you will be able to trade any token based on the dex.   Related Reading: Solana Has Flipped Ethereum In Yet Another Metric In Its Bid To Reach $200 Let&#8217;s explore Coinhall as A Bridge Swap DEX To explore Coinhall this way, you need to navigate to the Swap section. This section will give you the opportunity to bridge and swap at the same time. For instance, if you want to swap TIA (Celestia) to INJ (Injective) you can do this at ease with one click.  Instead of bridging TIA (Celestia) to TIA (Injective) then swapping it to INJ. You can do it as shown below: Conclusion With your INJ Coin securely stored in your wallet, you&#8217;re now poised to explore the exciting world of trading on the Injective Network. The scalability, low transaction fees, and swift processing times position the blockchain as a promising platform for crypto enthusiasts and traders alike.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/crypto-analyst-forecasts-matic-price-recovery-with-this-16-swing/",
    "description": "MATIC was one of the altcoins affected by the recent market downturn triggered by the controversial Matrixport report on the Bitcoin spot ETF this week. This negative sentiment pushed the cryptocurrency’s price from trading at nearly $1 to below $0.85 in a single move. However, the tide seems to be turning in favor of the bulls, as the MATIC coin has jumped more than 1.2% in the past day. In fact, a popular crypto analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has sounded a buy alarm for Polygon’s native token. Can MATIC’s Price Return To $0.96? In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward a bullish projection for the price of MATIC over the coming days. According to the crypto pundit, the cryptocurrency looks set to recover all its lost gains in a potential upward price movement. Related Reading: Revised Forecast: Bloomberg Analyst Cuts Probability Of Bitcoin Spot ETF Rejection To 5% The reasoning behind this bullish prediction for the Polygon token revolves around the TD (Tom DeMark) Sequential indicator. For context, the Tom DeMark Sequential indicator is used to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion and price reversal. #Polygon &#124; The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on $MATIC 4-hour chart. A spike in buying pressure around the current levels could see #MATIC rebound, potentially toward $0.88, and even as high as $0.96. pic.twitter.com/lj96zgPh7k — Ali (@ali_charts) January 6, 2024 Martinez noted in his analysis that the TD indicator is currently flashing a buy sign on MATIC’s 4-hour price chart. However, the crypto analyst highlighted that a bullish future for MATIC hinges on a spike in buying pressure around the current price levels. This could potentially see the Polygon token climb toward $0.88 and as high as $0.96, Martinez said. Ultimately, this bullish prediction depicts an almost 16% surge from the current price point.  It is worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe, which tracks the bullish and bearish momentum of a token, is currently at 38.2. When the RSI is below 50, it may suggest that the token is witnessing some bearish momentum. MATIC Price Overview As of this writing, the price of MATIC stands at $0.828969, reflecting a mere 1.2% increase in the past 24 hours. Polygon’s sluggish performance in the past day emphasizes the altcoin’s struggles over the last seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF: VanEck’s Head Of Research Says BlackRock Has $2 Billion In Investments Lined Up According to data from CoinGecko, the MATIC price has declined by more than 14% in the past week.

Nevertheless, MATIC ranks as the 14th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market capitalization of about $7.8 billion.

According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, a record 65.71 million ETH, representing 54.67% of the total circulating supply is now held by top addresses. Out of this figure, 56.25 million ETH belong to the top 150 self-custodial wallets. Consequently, the top 150 exchange-linked wallets now hold 9.46 million ETH, nearing its lowest level since June 2018.  Increasing Whale Accumulation: Possible Explanation The crypto industry went through a strong price surge in the last quarter of 2023, flipping the optimism around most cryptocurrencies bullish. Continued whale acquisitions can be linked to an anticipated continuation of the price growth in 2024, with the imminent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in the US lurking in the background. ETH market cap currently at $268 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The accumulation from Ethereum’s largest whales is a good sign for the long-term price, as it signals they believe the price will continue to increase. Their buying power also helps to establish price support by reducing the supply of ETH for sale.  Related Reading: Cardano Surges Nearly 250% In Development Activity, Whale Buying Appetite – Details Spotonchain recently showed that an Ethereum whale, identified as &#8216;0x931&#8217;, bought 21,192 ETH worth approximately $48 million at an average price of $2,265. The recent purchase now puts the whale&#8217;s total buys at 79,500 ETH since January 2023 and is now sitting on $36.84 million unrealized profit. At the same time, liquid staking protocols witnessed steady deposits throughout 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows that 12.3m ETH ($27.585 billion) are currently locked in ETH liquid staking derivatives. This represents an 80% growth from 6.8 million ETH locked in January 2023.  Featured image from Pixabay"

    "description": "Over the course of a single year, Akash (AKT) &#8211; a seemingly unheard of altcoin &#8211; exhibited a surprising surge, with its value skyrocketing by over 1,400%, showcasing remarkable resilience and strength in the market. This strong performance not only underscores the asset&#8217;s robustness but also positions it as a notable player in the cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: Cardano Surges Nearly 250% In Development Activity, Whale Buying Appetite – Details Akash Network&#8217;s Remarkable Recovery Surge When the price of the Akash Network (AKT) token recovered from the $0.75 level in mid-October 2023, it began an aggressive recovery pattern within the general tone of the market. The coin has increased by around 322% in the last three months alone. At the time of writing, AKT was trading at $3.11, up nearly 8% in the last 24 hours. Notably, the coin has tallied an impressive 40.4% increase in value in the last seven days, and currently sits at the No. 90 spot of Coingecko&#8217;s Top 100 roster. AKT seven-day price action.

This cutting-edge network increases price-performance and scalability for decentralized applications and organizations by facilitating the deployment of any cloud-native application. Utilizing the Cosmos SDK, a layer 1 protocol underpins the Akash platform. By using a Proof-of-Stake consensus process and a network of decentralized validators, it maintains network integrity. AKT currently trading at $3.11794079. Chart: TradingView.com These validators, who get commission payments in AKT, the native token of the network, are essential to the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. By staking their tokens, AKT holders—also referred to as delegators—further enhance the Akash chain&#8217;s security. Coinciding with the apparent divergence of opinion on the legitimacy of spot Bitcoin ETFs, AKT has recently experienced a jump in price. Dennis M. Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, recently asked the US SEC to turn down all ETF proposals. Potential fraud and manipulation are Kelleher&#8217;s main concerns, and she emphasizes that the SEC is in charge of averting significant harm to investors. Akash (AKT) Price Analysis The chart (below) shows the price of Akash Network (AKT) over a 4-hour period. The price has been in a downtrend since October, but it appears to be forming a bullish flag pattern. A bullish flag is a continuation pattern that occurs after a strong uptrend. The price consolidates within a narrow range for a period of time, before breaking out above the upper trendline of the flag. The breakout on January 3rd suggests that the bulls are back in control and that the uptrend is likely to resume. The upper Bollinger Band is also rising, which is another indication of bullish momentum. Akash Network coin price&#124; TradingView chart If the uptrend continues, the price could reach a target of $3.60, which is a 16.86% increase from the current price. However, it is important to note that there is no guarantee that the price will reach this target. The price could also break down below the lower trendline of the flag, which would signal that the downtrend is resuming. Overall, the chart looks bullish, but it is important to be aware of the risks involved in trading any cryptocurrency. Here are some additional things to keep in mind: The price of AKT is still well below its all-time high of $8.20, which it reached in April 2021. The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, so it is important to be prepared for sudden price swings. Related Reading: Polygon SAGA Airdrop: A Game-Changer For MATIC Investors?

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/revised-forecast-bloomberg-analyst-cuts-probability-of-bitcoin-spot-etf-rejection-to-5/",
    "description": "Popular Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has lowered the possibility of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denying the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETF to 5%. This latest forecast comes as crypto enthusiasts worldwide anticipate a wide-scale approval of various Bitcoin spot ETF proposals by the SEC on Wednesday, January 10. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF: VanEck’s Head Of Research Says BlackRock Has $2 Billion In Investments Lined Up Why The Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Appears Nearly Certain: Bloomberg Analysts Weigh In In October, Eric Balchunas and fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart predicted that there is a 90% chance that ARK Invest and 21 shares would receive approval for their joint Bitcoin spot ETF bid on January 10, which marked the final deadline date for the SEC’s response on their application. However, in a recent X post on January 6, Balchunas raised the probability of this greenlight to an astounding 95% after declaring that there was only a 5% probability the SEC would reject the ARK/21 ETF bid in the coming days.  This new prediction is based on the implausibility of all scenarios, which could represent a possible delay or non-approval of the ARK/ 21 shares Bitcoin spot ETF application. In an earlier X post on January 6, James Seyffart had listed these scenarios starting with ARK/21 shares spontaneously withdrawing their ETF proposal from the SEC, which he claimed to be highly unlikely.  Another scenario is that the SEC discovers new reasons to reject the launch of a crypto spot ETF, resulting in a drawn-out court battle between the US regulator and ARK/21Shares, a situation that Seyffart believes the SEC would rather avoid, especially following its recent loud legal loss against Grayscale investment. The final event that the Bloomberg analyst believes could prevent the clearance of the ARK/21 Shares ETF bid is a direct intervention from the US Presidency, another scenario that appears remotely possible.   Related Reading: ETF Or Halving: Analyst Doubles Down On Bullish Year For Bitcoin The D-Day Approaches The importance of ARK/21 Shares&#8217; joint bid to the Bitcoin spot ETF saga revolves around its final deadline date for an SEC response, which is the earliest of the bunch. Now, it is believed that the SEC will rather approve several Bitcoin spot ETF applications at once regardless of their respective final deadline date in a similar fashion as it did with Ether-futures ETFs in August.  This belief is backed by the discussions between the US regulator and various applicants in the last few weeks, leading to amendments in respective proposals, which indicates the preparation of an incoming approval. At the time of writing, the set date of expectation remains January 10, with crypto enthusiasts highly enthusiastic about the potential bullish effects of a spot ETF on Bitcoin’s price over the year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade at $44,050, having gained by 4.50% in the last week.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/dramatic-rise-in-cardano-ada/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst Guy Turner has predicted that Cardano (ADA) could experience a significant price surge soon enough. The analyst also gave an insight into what price levels the crypto token could hit when this happens.  Cardano To Rise To $1 In a video posted on his YouTube channel, Turner mentioned that ADA could rally to as high as $1 as that is the next significant level of resistance. The analyst’s projection is based on the fact that ADA’s weekly chart suggests that the crypto token is in the process of painting a bull flag.  Related Reading: BlackRock $10 Million Bitcoin Purchase Will Happen Today, Expert Says SEC Is Backed Into A Corner A rise to $1 doesn’t seem impressive to the analyst as he alluded to SOL’s price, which has seen incredible gains from its past lows. The crypto analyst highlighted Cardano’s fundamentals as one reason why it has continued to underperform. According to him, the supply of the token seems to be outweighing the demand for it. He also singled out Cardano’s founding entities, IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation, for contributing to a lot of sell pressure for the crypto token. These organizations are said to be selling a huge chunk of their ADA holdings to fund their operations. The silver lining is that this supply and demand dynamics doesn’t look to have impacted ADA’s price too much, Turner said. Meanwhile, he sounded bullish on Cardano in the long term as he noted that the interest rates, which have had more impact on ADA’s price, are likely to keep declining. As such, the crypto analyst believes that the crypto token could continue to rally alongside the rest of the broader crypto market despite its poor fundamentals.  ADA price at $0.51 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Will ADA Hit New All-Time Highs This Year? Turner further stated that whether or not ADA will hit new all-time highs this year will depend on its upcoming milestones. One of them happens to be the CIP 1694, a proposal that has been in focus in the Cardano ecosystem over the last year. Having been voted upon and passed, the CIP 1694 is set to be implemented with the Chang Hard Fork set to take place early this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Another milestone, which Turner considers the most important of them all, is the likely introduction of Cardano’s first fiat-backed stablecoin this year. IOG is said to be working on their stablecoin project, which could be released soon enough. Mehen Stablecoin’s USDM, which Turner referenced in his video, is also billed to launch in the first quarter of this year.  Following the release of Turner’s video, Mehen provided further updates on the USDM launch. They stated that the stablecoin is currently at the final stage of the audit. Once that is done, they plan to announce a final launch date.  The introduction of Cardano fiat-backed stablecoin is an important milestone as it can further boost the DeFi landscape on the network. The crypto analyst highlighted that it is “very difficult” to grow decentralized applications (dApps) on the network without the help of liquid fiat stablecoins.  Featured image from FX Empire, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "VanEck’s Head of Research, Matthew Sigel, recently hinted that the Spot Bitcoin ETF of the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, could see a record-breaking amount of inflows upon launch. This comes as an approval order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looks imminent.  BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Could See Inflows Of Over $2 Billion Sigel mentioned on an X (formerly Twitter) space hosted by the media platform, The Block, that he heard from a reliable source that BlackRock has “more than $2 billion lined up in week one.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Hit Major Milestone Amid Rapid Network Recovery This investment capital is said to be coming from existing Bitcoin holders who are looking to increase their exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency.  He quickly added that he couldn’t be 100% certain of this information. However, it is a possibility, considering that issuers would be looking to get investors that can inject huge sums into their respective ETFs.  Sigel went on to highlight how significant it could be if BlacRock’s ETF indeed saw $2 billion of inflows in the first week of trading, saying that it would “blow away” their initial projections. They estimate that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs could see $2.5 billion of inflows in the first quarter of trading. Meanwhile, they believe the market could grow to $40 billion in the next two years.  BTC price struggles to reclaim $44,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Not Out Of Place For BlackRock Commenting on the possibility of BlackRock seeing this significant amount of inflows, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that such an occurrence isn’t unusual for the world’s largest asset manager. According to him, BlackRock is known for lining up and injecting big cash into new ETFs on the first day of trading. That way, it registers as volume for them.  Related Reading: New Report Predicts When The XRP Price Will Cross $1.56 Balchunas further noted that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, seeing $2 billion of inflows, would shatter all records relating to first-day and week volume for an ETF. Interestingly, BlackRock already holds the record for the most successful ETF launch going by the amount of inflows recorded on day one.  The world’s asset manager further dominates the top 10 list of most successful ETF launches. Balchunas, however, clarified that those inflows were mainly lined up cash and not organic, as they were readily available before the ETF launched. He also mentioned that he got a second source to confirm Sigel’s claims that BlackRock has a big day one lined up.  Meanwhile, the Bloomberg analyst provided an update on when the approval order from the SEC was likely to come. Citing multiple sources, he stated that the SEC is lining up all issuers for a potential launch on January 11.  Featured image from Decrypt, chart from Tradingview.com"

In contrast, Ethereum, while maintaining a solid presence on GitHub with a daily average commit size of 183, now faces the challenge of catching up with the accelerated pace set by Cardano. Source: Santiment The data suggests that Cardano has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the development race, indicating a heightened focus on refining and expanding its blockchain capabilities. Analysts believe that Cardano&#8217;s ongoing spike in development is a favorable indication of an expanding ecosystem. The project&#8217;s emphasis on enhancing interoperability and promoting collaboration through international workshops has played a significant role in establishing its prominent position in the blockchain-oriented field. If current trends persist as anticipated, there is a likelihood that the price of Cardano will experience an upward trajectory in the upcoming days. This optimistic outlook is substantiated by the observed accumulation of the token by significant market participants, commonly referred to as whales, over the past two weeks. ADA market cap currently at $18.446 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, analyzing data from Santiment, NewsBTC conducted an assessment of the ADA holder addresses and observed a noteworthy increase in the holdings of the 1 million to 10 million ADA cohort. Specifically, on December 20th, the supply held by this cohort stood at 16%. However, as of the latest available data, that percentage has seen a discernible rise, reaching 16.36%. Source: Santiment Whale Accumulation: ADA&#8217;s Rising Investor Confidence The augmentation in ADA holdings within this particular cohort suggests a strategic accumulation of the cryptocurrency by influential market players. Whales, who typically control substantial amounts of a given asset, are often considered key indicators of market sentiment and can influence price movements. The observed increase in ADA holdings by this cohort implies a growing interest and confidence in Cardano among larger investors.

    "description": "The past week was largely defined by the Bitcoin price climbing above $45,800 for the first time in over 20 months, marking a great start to the year. However, the premier cryptocurrency soon experienced a sharp price pullback due to negative news about the BTC spot (ETF).  Interestingly, the latest on-chain data has revealed that investors seem not to have completely lost faith in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. $2.5 Billion Flows Into Crypto Market Following Bitcoin Crash In a post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered on-chain insight into the aftermath of the crash that affected Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. The pundit noted in his post that a substantial amount of funds flooded back into the sector a day after the market downturn. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Bitcoin’s $100,000 Transactions Soar, More Surge Ahead? This revelation was based on on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode. The relevant indicator here is the “positive 30-day capital inflows”, which tracks the net influx of capital into the crypto market over a 30-day period. Chart showing aggregate market realized value net position change &#124; Source: Ali_charts/X The chart above shows that a significant amount of funds have been entering the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. According to Glassnode’s data, more than $2.5 billion flowed back into the cryptocurrency market on Thursday, January 4, bringing the positive 30-day capital inflows to about $27.5 billion. This latest inflow of capital into the market offers insight into the positive shift in sentiment and market condition. It basically signals renewed investor confidence in crypto assets following a short period of uncertainty and price correction.  As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $43,661, reflecting a 0.2% decline in the past 24 hours. However, the market leader seems to be recovering well, with $44,000 not too far out of reach. How BTC Holders Reacted To The Market Downturn A recent analysis shows how various classes of Bitcoin investors reacted to the negative ETF news and the subsequent decline. This evaluation was based on the Spent Output Age Bands USD (SOAB) indicator on the CryptoQuant analytics platform. Related Reading: Solana Co-Founder: The Blockchain Doesn’t Need Layer-2s Like Ethereum The investors were divided into five classes based on the age of their holdings.

The 1-year-to-5-year holder class, on the other hand, barely made a move after the market downturn.
