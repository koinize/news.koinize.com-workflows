    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-sv-bsv-up-63-today-find-out-here/",
    "description": "Over the course of the past four days, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has witnessed a substantial surge in its price, marking an impressive milestone by reaching its highest point in the last 100 days. Remarkably, within this surge, BSV managed to breach the long-standing $40 horizontal resistance level, which had persisted since the month of July. This recent surge in the price of BSV has sparked considerable interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. It signifies a notable shift in the market dynamics, as BSV&#8217;s price trajectory has taken a positive turn after months of relative stagnation. At the time of writing, BSV was trading at $53.84, up 27% in the last 24 hours, and erecting a solid 63% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Related Reading: ETH Price Watch: Impact On Price As Traders Ditch Bitcoin On Derivatives Market Bitcoin SV 100-Day High Signals Renewed Market Interest The fact that BSV has achieved a 100-day high is indicative of a more sustained and potentially significant upward trend. This suggests that the cryptocurrency has garnered renewed interest from traders and investors, possibly driven by fundamental developments or market sentiment. Bitcoin SV (BSV), which originated in 2018 as a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash with the aim of increasing scalability through larger block sizes, has experienced a notable revival. Following an extended duration of rather stagnant price fluctuations, BSV has had a substantial spike of 57% subsequent to reaching a nadir in August. This resurgence in price enabled BSV to overcome a crucial resistance level which had been a significant barrier since July. BSV has a market cap of $1.04 billion at the time of writing. Chart: TradingView.com The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices is mainly driven by the widespread excitement surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This sentiment was further bolstered when the SEC chose not to appeal the legal case involving Grayscale. However, the spike in BSV&#8217;s price can be attributed to a misleading article, which falsely claimed that the SEC had anticipated the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, briefly causing Bitcoin&#8217;s value to rise to around $30,000 before rapidly declining. Binance Relaunches BSV, Leading To Price Surge Meanwhile, Binance &#8211; one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges &#8211; relaunched BSV through a USD-M BSV Perpetual Contract with 50x leverage on Friday, resulting in a 30% surge in BSV&#8217;s price and over $500,000 in short position liquidations, as reported by Coinglass. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge This move comes after a period of turmoil that began on April 15, 2019, when Binance delisted BSV because of a dispute between Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and BSV creator Craig Wright, primarily over Wright&#8217;s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, which resulted in alleged attacks on critics of his identity on Twitter. Bitcoin SV&#8217;s recent price surge, pushing it to monthly highs, could propel it towards the yearly peak near $57, as it broke key moving averages in the $33-35 range and has been on an upward trend since August lows at $26. Notably, BSV has faced strong resistance from its 200-day moving average since early 2021. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.
