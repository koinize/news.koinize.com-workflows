CZ will plead guilty to one felony charge as part of the negotiated agreement. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the settlement, claiming Binances policies allowed criminals involved in illicit activities to move stolen funds through the exchange. As part of the settlement, CZ announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-richard-teng-ceo-amid-changpeng-zhao-s-forced-departure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >stepped down as CEO</a> and that Binances global head of regional markets, Richard Teng, will assume the position. He added he was proud to point out that U.S. officials didnt allege that Binance misappropriated funds or manipulated markets.

BlackRock provided a presentation detailing how the firm could use an in-kind or in-cash redemption model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust. Many reports have suggested the SEC could be nearing a decision on a spot BTC ETF for listing on U.S. markets. SEC officials also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-meets-sec-to-discuss-bitcoin-trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >met with Grayscale representatives</a> this week to discuss the listing of a Bitcoin ETF.

The transaction fee is the eighth-highest in Bitcoins 14-year history. A wallet address tried transferring 139.42 BTC only to pay more than half the actual value of the transaction fee. The destination address received only 55.77 BTC. The mining pool Antpool captured the absurdly high mining fee on block 818087. This is the largest Bitcoin transaction fee ever paid in dollar terms, knocking off Paxos’s September transfer of $500,000.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Digest_25-11_1-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25902\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Digest_25-11_1-1024x682.png 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Digest_25-11_1-300x200.png 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Digest_25-11_1-770x513.png 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Digest_25-11_1.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sec-sues-kraken-alleging-it-s-an-unregistered-exchange-mixes-user-funds\"><strong><strong><strong>SEC sues Kraken alleging its an unregistered exchange, mixes user funds</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-kraken-for-securities-laws-violations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has sued Kraken</a>, alleging it commingled customer funds and failed to register with the regulator as a securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency. Additionally, the SEC alleged Krakens business practices and deficient internal controls saw the exchange commingle up to $33 billion worth of customer assets with its own. The SEC said this resulted in a significant risk of loss for its clients. In a follow-up blog post, Kraken said the SECs commingling accusations were no more than Kraken spending fees it has already earned, and the regulator doesnt allege any user funds are missing.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-appeals-court-rejects-sam-bankman-fried-s-bid-for-release\"><strong><strong>Appeals court rejects Sam Bankman-Frieds bid for releas</strong></strong>e</h2><p>Sam Bankman-Fried will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/court-rejects-sam-bankman-fried-release-bid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >stay jailed after failing to convince</a> a United States appellate court that he should be freed while his legal team appeals his conviction. Government prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of leaking Caroline Ellisons journals to The New York Times in July, which caused his bail to be revoked by a New York District Court. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven fraud and money laundering-related charges on Nov. 2.
