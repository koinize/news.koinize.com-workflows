The funds will be raised through investments from public financial institutions in Busan with nearly 100 private companies showing interest.

The standard will also be utilized for public services within Busan City. </p><p>The long-term blockchain development plan also includes the development of the Busan digital asset exchange in the first half of 2024. The digital exchange will not only list virtual assets, but also tokenized securities, including precious metals and raw materials such as gold, copper and oil. In the future, the administration behind the projects aims to tokenize and trade global intellectual property rights (IP) and carbon emissions rights. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/big-questions-did-the-nsa-create-bitcoin/\"><strong><em>Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
