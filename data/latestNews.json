On Monday morning, XRP accounted for 21% of global trade volume, ahead of Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), with 20%.

Kaiko noted in its report, however, that XRP had weathered the SEC suit, filed in 2020, with remarkably little downturn thanks to international support:</p><blockquote>“What’s interesting about XRP is that the lawsuit and exchange de-listings did not have an overly negative impact on price or volume at the time.” </blockquote><p>Interest remained high particularly in South Korea, with exchanges Upbit and Bithumb seeing $467 billion in trading after the suit was filed. Binance processed over $600 billion in trades in that time. </p><p>The SEC may appeal the ruling, Kaiko said.
