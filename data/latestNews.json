The Chinese government will also be mandating labels for artificially created content. </p><p>Earlier in the year, China banned any <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/midjourney-ai-users-find-workaround-amid-ban-on-chinese-president-s-images\">AI-generated images</a> of its president Xi Jinping. </p><p>Additionally, the measures require that all data and foundation models should be sourced from “legitimate sources” that respect the intellectual property rights of the creators, have appropriate consent and don’t undermine user privacy. </p><p>Similarly, the guidelines will hold service providers accountable for anything created through their platform. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-to-tighten-control-on-exports-of-ai-chip-making-materials\"><strong><em>China to tighten control on exports of AI chip-making materials</em></strong></a></p><p>The draft version of the regulations, which was released back in April included specific monetary fines for anyone deviating from the guideline, though it has since been removed.
