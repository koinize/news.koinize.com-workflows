The project recently surpassed 2 million sign-ups for its World ID during the beta phase, accomplishing this feat in less than half the time it took to reach the first million.</p>\n<p>The company announced the news via a blog on July 13 that it received a record number of signups from different parts of the world like Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, which it credited to its multi-city tour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the statement also revealed that an impressive average of over 40,000 people joined the World ID system weekly, demonstrating the widespread interest and support for this privacy-preserving digital identity solution.</p>\nWorld ID Thanks Supporters\n<p>The Worldcoin community has expressed its gratitude to the builders, integration and composability partners, and the individuals who continuously verify their World IDs.</p>\n<p>They wrote,</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you to everyone who made this milestone possible, from the builders to the integration and composability partners to the individuals verifying their World ID every day. Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it&rsquo;s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.&rdquo;</p>\n\nGrowing Demand For World ID\n<p>For billions of people without the means of digitally verifiable identification, the World IDs promise a globally recognized digital identification system wherein users can store their identity information on their mobile devices, safely secured by employing zk-proofs.</p>\n<p>To enroll in the World ID program and obtain a digital identification document, individuals are required to visit a specialized device called an Orb, through which they can scan one of their irises. This process generates a distinct cryptographic representation referred to as an \"IrisHash,\" which serves to authenticate the individual's uniqueness. Notably, participants who successfully upload their sensitive biometric data are compensated for their participation in the form of a proprietary digital currency known as Worldcoin.</p>\n<p>To meet the growing demand for verified World IDs, Worldcoin plans to significantly increase the availability of Orbs in the coming months. More information regarding the timing and locations of new Orbs will be shared in due course, ensuring a wider reach for this innovative technology.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/all/shiba-inu-shib-5-rally-reversal-confirmed/",
    "description": "The Shiba Inu price has risen over 5% in the last 24 hours amid the market-wide hype surrounding Ripple&#8217;s partial victory in its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But SHIB investors should still be cautious: While the SHIB price shows a clear uptrend of 23% over the last 30 days, a complete confirmation of a trend reversal is still pending. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Technically, the Shiba Inu price remains in bearish territory for several reasons. As explained in previous analyses, the Shib price entered a downtrend channel in early February this year. The breakout from the bearish chart pattern succeeded six days ago, however, there is still a possibility that it is a fakeout. Shib&#8217;s trading volume was rather below average during and after the breakout. Only yesterday there was a noticeable increase. Within the last few hours, trading volume rose to $232 million, 200% higher than the previous day. In the best case, the volume should remain high to avoid a fakeout. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Holding 10% Of Total SHIB Supply Shocks The Market More of a bearish argument is that yesterday&#8217;s SHIB rally stopped at $0.00000813. Thus, the price could not break above resistance at $0.00000816, nor could it set a new local high on the 4-hour chart. A look at the 1-day chart also shows that the SHIB price continues to trade below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000832. The following days could become crucial to confirm a sustainable trend change or a fakeout. The battle between bulls and bears is still in full swing. The bull side would ideally like to break out above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level with a high trading volume. This could be a first confirmation for a sustainable trend change. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming In this case, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000977 could come into focus. Close to it is also the long-term &#8220;bull boundary line&#8221;, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.00000961. If SHIB also exceeds this level, one can finally speak of a trend reversal. Before that, however, the current gains stand on shaky legs. Shibarium As Catalyst As NewsBTC reported, Shiba Inu chief developer Shytoshi Kusama has hinted a few days ago that the long-awaited layer-2 solution Shibarium will be unveiled along with numerous other innovations at the ETHToronto conference on August 15-16. With only 32 days left until this event, the hype could undoubtedly serve as a catalyst for SHIB. At least Shiba Inu ecosystem token BONE has already benefited from the announcement, raking in high double-digit percentage gains. Just today, Kusama fueled anticipation for Shibarium when he announced the relaunch of the official Shiba Inu website Shib.io. Via Twitter, Kusama teased &#8220;Enjoying the summer of Shibarium.&#8221; As the #summerofshibarium continues we are proud to introduce new branding for https://t.co/vRofmNPr53 and other #SHIBARMY websites!
