    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-bullish-bearish-divergences-santiment/",
    "description": "The analytics firm Santiment has revealed the list of altcoins that are showing the greatest bullish and bearish divergences currently. RSI Reveals These Altcoins To Contain The Most Extreme Values Right Now In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed some altcoins that are showing overvalued or undervalued conditions based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently. The RSI refers to a momentum metric in technical analysis that tracks the speed and magnitude of recent changes happening in the price of any given asset. This measurement can be made over any period, but in the context of the current topic, the 1-day RSI is of relevance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Nasdaq Continues To Be Negative: What It Means Generally, a high value of this indicator can be a sign that the asset is overheated right now and may be at risk of forming a top. More specifically, the 70 mark is chosen as the cutoff for when the probability of a bearish reversal becomes significant. On the other hand, the RSI being 30 or lower can imply the price is under its fair value at the moment, and as such, a potential reversal to the upside could be brewing for the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the 1-day RSI for a few different altcoins from the top 150 market cap list over the past year: Looks like three of these coins have a low value of the metric, while the other three are at high levels &#124; Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the 1-day RSI has been at high levels for Maker (MKR), Venus (vBNB), and Sei (SEI) recently. To be more specific, the metric has a value of 74.6, 72.4, and 75 for vBNB, SEI, and MKR, respectively. Clearly, these RSI levels are in the zone typically associated with an overheated market. Maker has recently enjoyed a sharp rally, observing gains of over 30% during the past couple of weeks. If this metric is anything to go by, though, the asset&#8217;s strong run may be approaching an end. On the other end of the spectrum are the altcoins Elrond (ELGD), Arweave (AR), and Bonk (BONK), which are observing low levels of 1-day RSI. ELGD and AR are inside the underpriced zone with the metric sitting at 22.6 and 29, while the Solana-based memecoin BONK is floating just over the area with a value of 31. According to Santiment, all six of these coins have also separated from the rest of the altcoins cohort, implying a bearish/bullish (depending on whether overvalued or undervalued) divergence could be forming for them. Related Reading: Analyst Says Expect A Decline To $30,220 If Bitcoin Loses This Support As such, coins like BONK observing a bullish divergence may be likely to see some price rise, so that they can catch up with the other alts. Similarly, MKR and others may see a correction to be more in line with the rest of the market. BONK Price Bonk has had a bad time these last few weeks, as its price has been following an overall downward trajectory. The coin may finally be starting to turn itself around, however, as its price has shot up over 22% in the past 24 hours. The price of the coin seems to have jumped over the past day &#124; Source: BONKUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
