Alongside former SEC officials Jay Clayton and Bill Hinman, these individuals would have been called to testify. </p><p>Jay Clayton is associated with the concept of the Ethereum Free Pass Speech, wherein executives were tasked with leading efforts that contributed to this stance.</p><p>Deaton concurred that it's essential for Hinman to provide testimony. Notably, there was no chance to legally summon a former SEC Chairman for a trial. Nevertheless, Deaton contends that the SEC erred in its decision to charge CEO Brad Garlinghouse, especially considering Jay Clayton's inclination to file a complaint against executives on a personal basis in a non-fraudulent context.</p><p>He maintains that Jay Clayton holds substantial importance as a witness who should provide testimony in the courtroom. Notably, Clayton engaged with Ripple's CEO and CTO, during which Brad Garlinghouse conveyed that \"Ripple is living in purgatory\" following the Hinman speech. However, neither Clayton nor Hinman explicitly stated that XRP was categorized as a security.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gen-z-in-south-korea-prefer-xrp\"><strong><em>Gen Z in South Korea prefers XRP and other altcoins to BTC and ETH: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>Obtaining a clarification from Clayton and Hinman could have averted legal expenses, time consumption, and bolstered cryptocurrency adoption.
