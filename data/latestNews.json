Messaging takes place almost instantly, but settlement does not, Tony McLaughlin, head of emerging payments and business development at Citi Treasury & Trade Solutions, said in a webinar introducing the project results.</p><p>The project abandoned trustlessness and anonymity, among other features, from its blockchain to create a system that contained value in the ledger, rather than settling via messaging. The simulated RLN functioned round the clock with multiasset settlement and programmability, McLaughlin said. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/fx-spot-settlement-in-10-seconds-ny-fed-releases-results-of-wholesale-cbdc-research\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/fx-spot-settlement-in-10-seconds-ny-fed-releases-results-of-wholesale-cbdc-research/amp\">FX spot settlement in 10 seconds: NY Fed releases results of wholesale CBDC research</a></em></strong></p><p>The simulated RLN preserved full U.S. Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer protections in international settlements, McLaughlin said.
