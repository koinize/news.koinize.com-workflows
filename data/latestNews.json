Over 1,200 ZK developers, community members and enthusiasts, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, showed up at the latest zkDay Istanbul event. </p><p>While ZK meet-ups attract 1,500 to 4,000 attendees, zkDay Istanbul — as a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration — witnessed a significant increase in enthusiasm as well. The event was built on top of the success of zkDay Paris, which had attracted early-stage ZK startups and market leaders.</p><p>ZK-focused projects from various stages came together to build connections and interact with top members of zkDay sponsor projects — Manta Network, co-hosted by Polyhedra Network and =nil; Foundation. </p><blockquote>“The interest and attendance for zkDay is a testament to the community's interest in the space, and we are excited to see that interest continuing to grow from country to country,” said Kenny Li, the COO and co-founder of the Manta Network, while speaking to Cointelegraph.</blockquote><p>Additionally, zkDay Istanbul ran alongside Devconnect 2023, an event dedicated to Ethereum community, builders, and researchers.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/6bf2cb58-2037-40de-a921-d74ab9fb0c04.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Manta Network co-founder Kenny Li (left) and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin (right) at zkDay Istanbul 2023.

Li anticipates future collaborations with zkDay Pitch sponsor ETH Global to provide greater exposure to promising upcoming projects.</p><p>Abner Jia, the CEO of Polyhedra Network, echoed Li’s optimism about the ZK community’s growth. Highlighting the surge in the interest in zero-knowledge technology, Jia stated: </p><blockquote>“With more projects and enthusiasts joining the zk ecosystem, it's clear that the community is on a strong growth trajectory.”</blockquote><p>Improving user experience remains a common goal across the ZK community as projects strive to onboard users into the next-generation consumer products. Li added:</p><blockquote>“That's why we are so focused on our Universal Circuits at Manta Pacific, where we can offer ZK-as-a-Service so developers can hit the ground running, launching EVM-compatible decentralized applications that leverage ZK without having to figure out the cryptographic elements.”</blockquote><p>Attendees of the zkDay Istanbul highlighted the ZK community’s strong convergence to the core mission of developers, users and community in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future\">Web3</a> in general.

Jia believes that collaboration remains key for the ZK ecosystem to thrive. “We are all striving for a fair, decentralized future. Leveraging zk is just another step to get there!,” added Li. </p><p>Speaking about the future of ZK, Jia also revealed Polyhedra’s newly deployed distributed proof system on zkBridge, named deVirgo. “We are open for collaborations. Entrepreneurs looking to make a mark in this space should closely watch our progress and implementations. It's essential to keep up with the latest developments in zk technology, as it's a rapidly evolving field,” he concluded.</p><p>The budding ZK community currently explores use cases that can be directly applied to drive next-generation consumer products using intuitive EVM-compatible decentralized applications.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
