    "description": "Crypto exchange Kraken started notifying affected XRP holders about the potential monetary benefits they could receive from the class action lawsuit against Ripple. The exchange recently emerged victorious in the Zakinov v. Ripple Case. The exchange successfully intervened to protect its customers‚Äô data from being shared without their consent. Related Reading: Ripple Initiates Large XRP Transactions Post Legal Setback Kraken Begins The Notification Process Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, intervened in the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit, seeking to protect its customer‚Äôs privacy and data. The court ruling allowed Kraken to inform the affected users about the class action against Ripple, ultimately giving the customers the option to decide whether to participate in the lawsuit. Kraken has now begun to notify eligible customers about the potential monetary benefits from the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit. The notification is aimed at Kraken users who purchased XRP during the previously established period, as the email stated: Our records indicate that you have purchased XRP on Kraken between July 2, 2017 and June 30, 2023, which means that it might be within your rights to receive money or benefits that come from the lawsuit, depending on the outcome. Yassin Mobarak, Dizer Capital Founder, was among the recipients, and he shared part of the email on X (formerly known as Twitter), expressing his surprise about the notification and the possibility of earning a profit from his XRP holdings through the class action lawsuit. I always thought I would make money from my $XRP holdings, but not like this üòÇ PS. First I thought this was a scam email, but now I think it&#39;s real. pic.twitter.com/4jhLuUSqEt &#8212; Yassin Mobarak ü™ù (@Dizer_YM) February 9, 2024 Mobarak expressed his initial disbelief in the email&#8217;s legitimacy, as recent phishing attacks exploited official email accounts of actors in the Web3 industry and exposed users to a massive and sophisticated phishing campaign. The legitimacy of the emails was doubted by several Kraken customers who sought confirmation from the exchange‚Äôs official X account. Kraken‚Äôs support team confirmed the email as safe and authorized by the exchange. Next Steps For XRP Holders Following the notification, Kraken has updated its support page to provide customers with further details about the class action lawsuit. The exchange addressed doubts such as who the affected parties are, clarifying that it ‚Äúonly applies to class members who purchased XRP within the United States during the relevant class period‚Äù and offering further information about the lawsuit: The lawsuit also claims that persons or entities who purchased XRP during the class period (July 3, 2017, to June 30, 2023) have the right to recover (a) the consideration paid for the XRP, with interest, if they retained the XRP, less the current price of the XRP or upon tendering the XRP, or (b) damages if they sold the XRP at a loss. Lastly, the exchange presented two options for the affected customers: do nothing or ask for an exclusion from the lawsuit. As mentioned in the email you received, you have the option to either do nothing or exclude yourself. For more details, please visit the support article linked below. üëâ https://t.co/qGViqcahTw Best,Kraken Support üêô &#8212; Kraken Support (@krakensupport) February 8, 2024 If the customer decides to do nothing, they will keep the possibility of getting the money or benefits from the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution. However, they automatically give up on any rights to sue Ripple separately in the future. If they decide to be excluded from the class action and the potential benefits, XRP holders maintain the right to sue the defendant and must send a signed ‚ÄúExclusion Request‚Äù statement by April 5, 2024.
