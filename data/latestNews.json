During the same period, Pepecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/pepe-price-index\">PEPE</a>), Shiba Inu (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index\">SHIB</a>) and ApeCoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/apecoin-ape-price-index\">APE</a>) saw a 25% decline. The big question is whether this trend will affect the wider market, signaling a broader bear market, or simply reflects lagging performance of memecoins.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/93a6cd76-931d-4644-a05e-f6113e3684f6.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total crypto market cap (blue) vs. PEPE/USDT (green), SHIB/USDT (red), APE/USDT (orange), August 2023. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Memecoins like Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) burst onto the scene, driven by viral memes and community enthusiasm. However, their appeal faded due to a mix of factors. These coins rely on media hype and online communities for attention, yet they lack value beyond their meme origins. Their speculative nature leads to rapid price changes and volatility.</p><p>Furthermore, the memecoin market has become saturated with copycats, drawing focus and resources to more traditional cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Capital rotates as investors shift their attention to new trends</h2><p>For traders, the mid-August crypto market crash was a stark reminder of memecoin volatility. Many of these coins emerged in the last six months, like PEPE and Milady Meme Coin (LADYS). This might push new entrants away and create a negative sentiment, potentially extending a bear market to the broader crypto landscape. </p><p>However, this underperformance is typical for memecoins, as seen in the past, like when APE, SHIB and PEPE lagged the total crypto market by 18% between June 5 and June 15.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/c61b6a17-e2c7-4eb8-b862-14c996b2a34f.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total crypto market cap (blue) vs. PEPE/USDT (green), SHIB/USDT (red), APE/USDT (orange), June 2023. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>These two instances don’t necessarily mean memecoins will always perform worse than the broader crypto market. They reflect a higher beta in the sector, where memecoins tend to exaggerate market movements. Despite this, it’s uncertain if excessive price drops are a backward-looking phenomenon or signal a market reversion.</p><p>Contrary to expectations, memecoins can also lag during bull markets. For instance, between March 13 and March 30, memecoins fell while the total crypto market cap gained 17.5%. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/451bd1ed-f51f-4d47-9505-9443f069db53.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total crypto market cap (blue) vs. FLOKI/USDT (green), SHIB/USDT (red), APE/USDT (orange), March 2023. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>After looking at the two most recent instances of memecoin underperformance, it’s crucial to examine their aftermath. This entails determining whether the price drop hinted at a possible market bottom or if it merely signaled investors shifting their attention to other cryptocurrencies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/9aab1f40-6939-419b-9724-7449494f8825.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cryptocurrency market total capitalization, USD. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Despite the bullish evidence, external factors influence memecoin price action</h2><p>Following the mid-June and late-March period when memecoins underperformed, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization either remained steady or experienced notable gains in the subsequent weeks. Numerous factors could have influenced investor sentiment during these periods. For instance, the sentiment might have been influenced by <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-new-sec-filings-wisdomtree-invesco\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-new-sec-filings-wisdomtree-invesco/amp\">BlackRock's application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> on June 15.</p><p>Similarly, on March 31, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-bitcoin-bulls-are-well-positioned-to-profit-from-this-week-s-4-2b-options-expiry\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-bitcoin-bulls-are-well-positioned-to-profit-from-this-week-s-4-2b-options-expiry/amp\">Bitcoin options worth $4.2 billion expired</a>. This event was seen as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) to strengthen its $28,000 support level. This was due to a notable imbalance between call (buy) options and put (sell) instruments, with call options surpassing put options by $1.2 billion. This likely favored Bitcoin bulls and could have led them to utilize profits from the expiry to bolster the BTC price.</p><p>However, since neither of the last two sharp corrections in memecoins was succeeded by broader cryptocurrency market declines, the possibility of Bitcoin finding support around $26,000 remains a possibility. Nevertheless, as evident from the ETF and options expiry incidents, market trends and memecoin price action are primarily steered by news and events. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/by-the-numbers-deciphering-xrp-lost-momentum/",
    "description": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) legal tussle with Ripple over the XRP token may have significantly set its trajectory back in the US market. Crypto lawyer John Deaton explained this in an X (formerly known as Twiter) post uploaded earlier today, shedding light on the ramifications of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit on XRP&#8217;s potential adoption in the US. You could NEVER underestimate the damage the SEC’s lawsuit has caused &#8211; NOT ONLY AGAINST RIPPLE &#8211; BUT #XRP. THREE YEARS OF ADOPTION &#8211; that’s what it’s caused. Just how long is 3 yrs &#8211; in crypto years? People seem to forget how much Coinbase promoted #XRP before the lawsuit.… https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd pic.twitter.com/GLu4kFUU38 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 The comments come when discussions about regulatory clarity in crypto are more intense than ever, with token holders striving for clearer guidelines in the North American country. Related Reading: XRP About-Face Sparks Another Descent – What Lies Ahead? The Coinbase Connection According to Deaton, Coinbase, one of the pioneering cryptocurrency exchanges in the US, was at the forefront of promoting XRP before regulatory challenges arose. Deaton pointed out that before listing XRP, Coinbase proactively reached out to the SEC for clarity. In a meeting held in January 2019, Coinbase presented its regulatory framework for evaluating digital assets – a framework that had previously garnered admiration from senior SEC staff. With no objections raised by the SEC, Coinbase proceeded to list XRP the following month. In fact, in January 2019 Coinbase asked for and got a meeting with the @SECGov to SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS THE REGULATORY STATUS OF #XRP! Coinbase explained to the SEC that Coinbase had evaluated #XRP and ran it through Coinbase’s stringent regulatory framework for digital assets. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 Furthermore, the fact wasn&#8217;t just restricted to Coinbase. Payment processing giant MoneyGram, which had established a partnership with Ripple for remittances, disclosed its intentions to integrate with the XRP  Ledger through a formal filing with the SEC. Much like the Coinbase instance, MoneyGram didn’t receive any complaint from the regulatory body either, but the ensuing legal battle halted the company&#8217;s plans.  The Controversial Lawsuit And Its Implications For XRP Contrary to these initial interactions, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. Deaton emphasized that several industry stakeholders, including the lawyers at MoneyGram and Coinbase, assessed XRP and determined it was not a security. Yet, the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple painted a contrasting narrative. Amazingly, despite all the above (and so much more), on December 22, 2020, less than 2 years AFTER Coinbase met with the SEC about #XRP, and 18 months AFTER MoneyGram disclosed to the SEC it was utilizing #XRP, and despite lawyers at the SEC not concluding #XRP was a security in… — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023 The following legal battle created was felt across the crypto industry. It raised questions about the regulatory landscape and brought forth discussions about the nature of cryptocurrencies and how they are classified in the US.  While Ripple has seen commendable success outside the US, Deaton underscored that the lawsuit undeniably hindered XRP&#8217;s adoption within the country. Related Reading: XRP Price Shows Confluence Of Bearish Factors and Could Decline Again From Deaton&#8217;s perspective, the evidence gathered over the past three years suggested that the lawsuit may have been part of a strategy. While it remains speculative to conclude the exact motivations behind the SEC&#8217;s actions, the impact on XRP&#8217;s US adoption and the broader crypto market has been palpable. Deaton concluded: It is so clear the lawsuit was used as a weapon. I said it only 9 days after the Ripple lawsuit in a federal pleading, when I filed the Writ of Mandamus against the SEC, and all the evidence uncovered during the last 3 years proves it to be true.

    "title": "Will Bitcoin Show A Repeat Of The March Rebound?",
    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-show-repeat-of-the-march-rebound/",
    "description": "Will Bitcoin observe a repeat of the rebound that took place after the crash back in March? Here&#8217;s what this on-chain metric suggests. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Is Showing A Pattern Similar To March As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained, if the BTC short-term holder SOPR crosses above 1 in the coming days, a rebound might occur. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (SOPR) here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the investors are selling their Bitcoin at a profit or a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder is currently moving their coins at a profit. On the other hand, values under this threshold imply that loss-taking is the dominant behavior in the market. The SOPR being precisely equal to one naturally suggests that the investors are just breaking-even on their selling currently, as the total amount of profits realized in the market is precisely canceling out the losses. In the context of the current discussion, the SOPR for only a specific market segment is of interest. Namely, the short-term holder (STH) SOPR is the relevant metric. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past few months: Looks like the 7-day SMA value of the metric has been below the 1 mark in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The STH group includes investors who purchased their BTC less than 155 days ago. This cohort makes up one of the two main segments of the market, the other side being the &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs). As displayed in the graph, the 7-day Bitcoin STH SOPR had been floating around the neutral mark before the recent crash, but following it, the metric has plunged into the loss territory. This would suggest that the STHs have been panic-selling at a loss after they witnessed the cryptocurrency register a deep drawdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dip Worth Buying? What Market Sentiment Suggests The chart shows that the crash back in March of this year also pushed the STHs into selling at a loss. The lowest value that the 7-day STH SOPR has seen in the current crash so far has been similar to what the March crash observed. Historically, capitulation has allowed the asset to form bottoms, as in such events, the weak hands exit the market, and the more persistent investors may pick up their coins. This effect seems to have worked in March, as the coin hit its bottom during the STHs&#8217; capitulation. As the loss selling slowed down, Bitcoin rebounded in speculator fashion, as its price jumped below $20,000 to near the $30,000 mark. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Retest $20,500 Again? This Pattern May Suggest So Currently, the STHs&#8217; loss selling is slowing down, as the metric&#8217;s value is gradually rising. The latest capitulation may have also allowed BTC to form a bottom this time. It remains to be seen whether that was the case, and if Bitcoin can show a rebound similar to back in March. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 11% in the last week. BTC has been hanging on around the $26,000 level &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Yiğit Ali Atasoy on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"
