    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-triple-bitcoin-forecast-a-pre-halving-surge/",
    "description": "PlanB, the creator of the renowned Stock-2-Flow (S2F) model, has once again captured the community&#8217;s attention with three bullish Bitcoin (BTC) forecasts. In a YouTube video recently uploaded, the S2F creator shared bold predictions. In the short term, PlanB sees Bitcoin soaring to above $50,000 before the upcoming halving event scheduled for April. The S2F model creator noted in the YouTube video: I think in the next four months towards the halving, we will start to see Bitcoin rise even further towards $50,000 [to] $60,000 region. This prediction aligns with historical trends, where Bitcoin often experiences a surge in buying activity in anticipation of halving events, which cut the block reward by 50%. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Bitcoin’s $100,000 Transactions Soar, More Surge Ahead? PlanB&#8217;s Long-Term Vision: A Rally To $532,000 Looking further ahead, PlanB&#8217;s projections become even more ambitious. The S2F model creator foresees Bitcoin breaking past its all-time high to reach $100,000 later this year. According to PlanB, this prediction gains credibility with the recent US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a milestone development for the crypto market. By 2025, PlanB&#8217;s vision for Bitcoin will reach a monumental peak of $532,000. This long-term forecast, underpinned by the S2F model, suggests a future where Bitcoin cements its status as a digital store of value and profoundly disrupts traditional financial paradigms. PlanB&#8217;s confidence in these targets is bolstered by his S2F models and the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. I expect $55k bitcoin at halving, $100k in 2024, $532k in 2025:https://t.co/TSo7TpNfzb pic.twitter.com/mQaXM5Qabb — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) January 10, 2024 Bitcoin Current Bull Run: Beyond $48,000 And Rising Amid PlanB&#8217;s predictions, BTC is riding a bullish wave following the landmark approval and trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. The asset has leaped from its 24-hour low below $45,000 to over $48,000, demonstrating a 5.7% increase in the last 24 hours. This surge is accompanied by a dramatic spike in trading volume, indicating heightened investor interest and market activity. PlanB is not alone in forecasting a bright future for BTC. Finance guru Robert Kiyosaki recently projected a $150,000 target for BTC, largely influenced by the expected influx of institutional investment through spot ETFs. BITCOIN ETF. Yay. Glad I bought years ago. Bitcoin to $150k soon. Gold to the moon as Central Banks buy , store, and never sell. Silver to crash as silver stackers sell to pay bills, caused by rising inflation. Great news for silver stackers. Time to buy more as silver crashes.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 10, 2024 While the exact timing of this milestone remains uncertain, the consensus among experts points to a significant potential for Bitcoin&#8217;s price escalation shortly. Adding to the bullish sentiment, BTC has seen a significant increase in high-value transactions, a trend not seen in nearly two years. Analyst Ali reported significant transactions exceeding $100,000 among Bitcoin whales. Santiment&#8217;s data further corroborates the growing interest in Bitcoin, with a notable uptick in social dominance and spot ETF-related discussions. This heightened social interest since mid-October last year underscores the impact of investor sentiment and social dynamics on Bitcoin&#8217;s market trajectory.
