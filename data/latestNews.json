However, it relies on a centralized order book to match traders with market makers. Because of this order book, it's sometimes regarded as not being truly decentralized. </p><p>The dYdX team has been trying to create a new Cosmos-based dYdX chain they say will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/dydx-to-launch-decentralized-order-books-exchange-on-cosmos-kbw-2023\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/dydx-to-launch-decentralized-order-books-exchange-on-cosmos-kbw-2023/amp\">allow them to decentralize</a> the exchange’s order book, taking the protocol out of the hands of the development team and making it truly decentralized.

Instead, it stated that readers should “check out the blog post from the dYdX Operations subDAO” to learn more.</p><p>In an October 4 post, the dYdX Operations subDAO <a href=\"https://www.dydxopsdao.com/blog/v4-genesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> a phased mainnet launch. The proposed alpha phase will allow token holders to stake their tokens and earn staking rewards, but trading will not be possible. The beta phase will enable trading and allow further testing to occur. The post does not state a launch date for either phase.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template>\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "
