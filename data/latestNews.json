It will also pay a $4.3 billion fine, the largest in the history of the U.S. Treasury Department. </p><p>Moreover, Binance’s founder, CEO and principal owner Changpeng “CZ” Zhao — deemed by many the most powerful individual in crypto — will be sidelined from the firm for at least three years after the naming of a court-appointed monitor. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.<br><br>Binance is no longer a baby. It is…</p>&mdash; CZ  BNB (@cz_binance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1727063503125766367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>But those may not even be the most important effects. </p><p>“The settlement is a lot bigger than that,” Yesha Yadav, Milton R. Underwood chair, professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University Law School, told Cointelegraph, adding: </p><blockquote>“It will bring some systematic oversight to Binance by virtue of a monitorship agreement, signaling the end of an era where the exchange has been able to operate in a relatively borderless way, without headquarters and seemingly without a major domestic regulator.”</blockquote><p>It will subject Binance to more “scrutiny over its products, risk management, governance, trading partnerships and compliance rigor” than it’s ever experienced before, Yadav continued, and the exchange will probably undergo significant structural reform to put it on a more compliant footing.</p><p>The agreement, which Binance reached with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Treasury Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), should have industry-wide consequences — and not necessarily negative, either. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/adoption-mainstream-blockchain-games\">Mainstream approval critical for blockchain games — Gaming execs</a></em></strong></p><p>Indeed, the deal is a “long-term positive” for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, according to Austin Campbell, founder and managing partner at Zero Knowledge Consulting and adjunct professor at Columbia University’s School of Business. He told Cointelegraph:</p><blockquote>“This is an acknowledgment that crypto is here to stay, and people should have access to it.” </blockquote><p>It is arguably a monumental event for the industry, in part, because stateless Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange that at times has processed two-thirds of all digital trades, while Zhao, who reached a separate plea deal, is viewed by many as the face of the industry, particularly since the downfall of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried. </p><h2>“We will get you”</h2><p>“Only the U.S., with its proven and rather unique extraterritorial application of its law, can do this,” Switzerland-based attorney Markus Hammer, principal of consulting firm HammerExecution, told Cointelegraph. “The signal to the crypto world could not have been clearer,” he said, adding: </p><blockquote>“If you are addressing U.S. users and actively involved in money laundering and circumventing U.S. sanctions in the crypto business, we will get you. We will get you, including your CEO, and even if you have no registered headquarters.’”</blockquote><p>However, Binance may not be totally out of the woods yet with regard to federal U.S. charges. Separately, the SEC brought 13 charges against Binance in June, and those cases have yet to be heard. Moreover, these charges “are much broader than the ones brought collectively by the DOJ, CFTC and Treasury,” Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex, told Cointelegraph.</p><p>Binance has evolved into a multifunction organization, observed Alexander, going well beyond its exchange activities. It has a nonfungible token marketplace, for instance, and conducts market-making activities through two firms <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/binance-ceos-trading-firm-received-11-bln-via-client-deposit-company-sec-says-2023-06-07/#:~:text=In%20its%2013%20charges%2C%20the,the%20SEC%20wrote%20in%20its\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">controlled</a> by Zhao: Merit Peak and Sigma Chain. </p><p>The SEC has charged that Binance and Zhao commingled client assets in these market-making firms and used those customer assets as their own, which sounds a lot like what FTX did before its collapse. It will take some time before these latest cases are brought, however, Alexander noted. </p><h2>Paving the way for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs)?</h2><p>Still, the DOJ plea deal seems to offer some relief for the crypto sector. Some feared the government might try to put Binance out of business and feared global consequences given the firm’s ubiquity. So the settlement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1726664338575122701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">eliminated</a> a big “overhang” in the market by this view. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Binance was the biggest idiosyncratic overhang on this market for the entire last year. Looks like we may finally be getting some resolution on it. <br><br>Markets hate uncertainty and they love clarity and resolution. <br><br>Similar vibes to the Bitmex resolution in 2020.</p>&mdash; Will (@WClementeIII) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1726664338575122701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>“I see the clarity now provided by the authorities in connection with the deal as very positive for the crypto industry, in general,” said Hammer. “It should also pave the way for a [U.S.] BTC spot-market ETF, which is likely to be launched in January 2024, and perhaps an ETH Spot ETF later in the year.”</p><p>Others saw the settlement as another sign the industry is maturing and moving beyond its buccaneering origins. </p><p>The Binance of 2018 is very different from the Binance of today, according to Campbell. It’s evolved from what he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseaustincampbell_binance-regulation-crypto-activity-7132825627514015744-lU3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">called</a> “an evasive pirate enterprise” to one that is “well-established in some jurisdictions with actual KYC/AML programs and risk professionals in place.” </p><p>“Binance has been committed to getting it right for a while,” Campbell told Cointelegraph, referencing people like Richard Teng — named Zhao’s successor as CEO — and Noah Perlman, chief compliance officer, as examples of its growing seriousness vis-a-vis compliance and regulation. The DOJ settlement “is just one more step on that road.”</p><p>Just as the internet’s early pioneers eventually became integrated into the main market and economic system, “so too is crypto coming into the fold,” Truflation founder and CEO Stefan Rust said last week in a statement. “Full regulation and taxation are now here.”</p><p>Zhao himself seemed to see the shape of things to come back in 2021, when he <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/compliance-is-a-journey-says-binance-ceo-amid-regulatory-scrutiny\">stated in a public letter</a> that regulation often trails innovation, particularly with revolutionary technologies like crypto. “The adoption and development of crypto has many parallels with that of the car. When the car was first invented, there weren’t any traffic laws, traffic lights or even safety belts.” Those came later. </p><h2>Allowing Binance to survive?</h2><p>Some also read in the DOJ settlement a conscious decision by the U.S. government <em>not</em> to drive Binance out of business. Campbell said: </p><blockquote>“One of the biggest negatives for the [crypto] space and for the United States would have been regulators embracing the goal of a crypto ban. This is very much the reverse: the settlement is explicitly about Binance continuing to exist.”</blockquote><p>According to Yadav, “a reformed Binance might benefit the crypto industry as a whole by offering a source of private standard-setting and representing a more maturing, careful organization to the world.”</p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-supercycle-2024-investment-trading\">Bitcoin supercycle 2024: Is this the cycle to end them all?</a></em></strong></p><p>Maybe that’s going too far. Binance was already growing less dominant in the industry before the plea deal, and that trend could still continue, especially as the SEC case with its broader charges remains outstanding. </p><p>Binance could also lose market share over time as risk-seeking consumers gravitate to smaller, offshore exchanges, acknowledged Yadav, while adding:</p><blockquote>“But this settlement offers a possible way back for Binance to shed its image as a risk-tolerant firm that has acquired market share by aggressively pursuing customer acquisition at all costs.”</blockquote><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "XRP investors may be looking at one of the most important upgrades yet according to a prominent developer in the community. This was revealed by the lead developer of one of the major projects building on the XRP Ledger, hinting that a MasterCard integration may be coming. Bringing MasterCard, Self-Custody, And More To XRP In a post that was shared on X (formerly Twitter), Xumm Wallet lead developer Wietse Wind excitedly announced to the community that self-custody is on the way. The announcement featured a screenshot that showed the option to make purchases with prepaid XRP, a feature that is yet to drop.

Xumm @Tangem  NFC hardware wallets: ordered with optional pre-paid XRP to cover the account reserve &#38; an additional 50$ in XRP (no KYC). Full announcement &#38; details: upcoming week,” the developer said. This sparked a lot of excitement in the community but these also came with questions. One X user asked if users would be able to link a credit card to their Xumm wallet to make purchases. The developer responded by saying “These are hardware wallets, they don&#8217;t work @ terminals and ATMs.” However, in a follow-up, the user declared “Debit cards and Xumm is all I want.” To which Wietse Wind responded that they are working on it. “Debit MasterCard, self custody, card authorization with custom on ledger limits on your account using a Hook,” Wietse Wind revealed.

One particularly recurring theme was card fees which users have come to loathe. One user John Mcclain implored the team to not have a +1% fee on charges, referencing the charges by another prominent payment platform in the XRP space, Uphold, which the user says charges a high fee. According to them, “This can really add up quick!” Related Reading: Ripple IPO May Be Delayed, Crypto Pundit Gives Reasons Why Moving to allay worries, Wietse Wind reminded users that using credit and debit cards means that there will be fees attached. This is because this is how these cards work, and also “that’s how they are able to insure, give cash backs, and make tremendous amounts of money.” However, this problem does not seem to be alien to the Xumm team as the developer revealed that running entirely separate rails would be beneficial in addressing the fees issue. But for now, “we&#8217;ll have to address the chicken/egg problem over and over again.” Featured image from The Coin Republic, chart from Tradingview.com"
