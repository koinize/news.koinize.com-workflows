Because, let’s be honest, all of these crypto projects eventually collapse into Bitcoin, or they eventually collapse full stop. I mean, we saw enough of that last year. And, you know, in 10, 15, 20, maybe 40 years’ time, will Bitcoin still be running? 1,000%. Will Ethereum still be running? Question marks. And will the other 20-ish thousand crypto projects still be going strong? I’m pretty confident they won’t be.”</blockquote><p>Hall proved his point by asking co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond to open up their Bitcoin Lightning wallets to accept the equivalent of $5 in satoshis. And after DeYoung downloaded the wallet and received the payment, both co-hosts were astonished at the speed of the transaction. </p><p>On Episode 13 of <em>The Agenda </em>podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Hall about his views on Bitcoin adoption and its “marketing problem,” his ultimate vision of how Bitcoin could eventually conquer the financial world, and how his experience as a Bitcoin evangelist has connected him with people all around the world. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/44a1b8a9-e9b5-4341-87ef-fc0966a8c8e3.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>It’s more than just money</h2><p>Hall believes that Bitcoin is more than just money: It’s a revolution, a lifestyle, a binder of people and a builder of community. </p><p>Hall said: </p><blockquote>“Bitcoin, to me, in my own words: It’s an expression of how we approach the world, I guess. I mean, it’s had an impact on me, in terms of my approach to people, to different cultures and in the way in which I interact with people — despite the fact that it is just a bunch of code on a screen. And because it’s re-wired the way in which I look at the world and consider things, it’s taught me to be more skeptical and to not take things at face value. But it’s also delivered a lot of hope and a lot of sort of meaning to my existence that perhaps wasn’t there previously.”</blockquote><template data-ct-widget=\"buzzsprout\" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id=\"2096305\"></template><p>Hall has elected to only live off Bitcoin for day-to-day expenses, excluding when he has to pay European Union taxes. As to why he is such a strong believer in the digital currency, Hall shared, “We can’t live in a world that is governed by growth at all costs when we have one finite, very precious planet.”</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin, for me, it appeals to me because of the way that it flips that all on its head. You know, we have a deflationary currency, there’s only going to be 21 million, and we can rebuild our economic system off that in a way that raises all boats, not just the elite few. And it tackles things like the wealth gap and wealth inequality. It tackles things like the environment and the way in which, you know, Bitcoin mining could be this transition to using more and more renewable energies.”</blockquote><p>To hear more from Hall’s conversation with <em>The Agenda </em>— including Hall’s future vision for Bitcoin and his fascination with the Lightning Network — listen to the full episode on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-agenda\">Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agenda/id1659393166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6azmkkIXj5LQbxTRAbAqXS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotify</a>.

    "description": "<p>London, United Kingdom, June 7th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Sweat Economy, the pioneering move-to-earn project, is launching a new governance vote today in the Sweat Wallet application, letting the community decide the fate of 2 billion idle SWEAT tokens in inactive user accounts.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The 2 billion SWEAT tokens, constituting ~13% of the total supply, are currently locked up in a 24-month contract in inactive user accounts.</p><p></p><p>After the successful Token Generation Event last September, a considerable number of users, despite repeated prompts, have yet to activate the Sweat Wallet application and claim their tokens.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The new governance vote aims to resolve the lingering question: what should be done with these idle tokens? Sweat Economy now allows token holders to participate directly in the decision-making process, exercising the principle of one person, one vote, thereby democratizing the token's future.</p><p></p><p>Users can either vote in favor of having the 2 billion idle SWEAT tokens recovered and transferred back to the Sweat Treasury for potential future distribution (or other uses as decided by subsequent votes), or users can vote in favor of leaving these tokens in inactive user accounts.</p><p></p><p>A minimum of 75,000 votes is required for the proposal to be accepted or denied, and in order to ensure everyone has a fair opportunity to make their vote count, the proposal will run for at least seven days, with the possibility of a three-day extension, in the event of an ongoing influx of votes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This new governance vote is notable because of the vast volume of SWEAT tokens at stake and the deepening commitment of Sweat Economy to community-centric decision-making. The platform is determined to ensure all voices are heard, regardless of the size of their SWEAT holdings. This intention resonates well with the community, as highlighted by user feedback:</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for letting the community know before the vote is live. Much better for transparency.&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good proposal! I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they propose to do with over 2 billion $SWEAT!&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>The previous vote attracted a whopping 153,783 participants, and Sweat Economy is optimistic about seeing even higher engagement numbers this time, given the magnitude of SWEAT tokens involved.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This milestone event strengthens Sweat Economy's mission to create a more inclusive, transparent, and democratized ecosystem, continuing to foster strong community involvement and influence over pivotal decisions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>About Sweat Economy</p><p>Established in 2015, Sweat Economy promotes healthier living by encouraging people to move more.
