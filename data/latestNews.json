    "description": "The hacker responsible for the $41 million hack of the crypto casino Stake on September 4 made another move on September 11. Following this, they transferred an additional $328,000 worth of Polygon (MATIC) and BNB (BNB) tokens, as the blockchain security company CertiK reported. Transferred Funds By Hackers Are Estimated At $4.8 Million On September 11, the hacker first transferred 520,000 MATIC tokens, worth over $266,000, which were bridged to the Avalanche blockchain. Some hours later, 300 BNB tokens valued at approximately $61,500 were sent to an externally owned address labeled &#8220;0x695&#8230;&#8221;.  Before these recent transfers, the hacker had bridged $4.5 million to different Bitcoin blockchain addresses. This was reported by the blockchain security company Arkham on September 7. The total amount transferred, now at $4.8 million, only constitutes 1.2% of the total $41 million stolen by the hackers.

The Stake hackers exploited the platform by gaining access to the private keys of the platform&#8217;s Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum hot wallets.  According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Lazarus Group from North Korea &#8211; known for its involvement in various cybercrimes, including hacking and cryptocurrency-related attacks, might be behind this exploit.  The Total Amount Of Money Lost Due To Hacks And Scams Has Exceeded $1 Billion The recent hack of $41 million from Stake has contributed to the cumulative losses from cryptocurrency hacks and scams in 2023. As a result of this incident, the total losses in the cryptocurrency industry have now surpassed the $1 billion mark. Before the Stake attack, CertiK had reported the total losses to be approximately $997 million at the end of August. But for August alone, CertiK reported that exit scams resulted in approximately $26 million in losses. Flash loan attacks accounted for $6.4 million, and exploits caused losses of $13.5 million. The cybersecurity firm verified that these combined losses exceeded $45 million for the past month. However, with several attacks occurring in the past two weeks, the overall figure has now crossed the $1 billion threshold.  For instance, a prominent cryptocurrency investor lost $24 million of staked Ether (ETH) in a phishing attack on September 6. Additionally, Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s X (formerly Twitter) account was compromised on September 9, and the hacker used it to trick several individuals into participating in a nonfungible token scam, resulting in a total loss of $691,000. Considering these incidents, in addition to CertiK&#8217;s previous estimate from August, the total losses due to cryptocurrency-related incidents would now exceed at least $1.04 billion.
