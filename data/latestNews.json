On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p><p>TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum</p><p></p>ContactHayward Wongpress@tron.network"
