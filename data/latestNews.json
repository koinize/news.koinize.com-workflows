    "description": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the FTX crypto exchange, who was recently found guilty of multiple counts of criminal fraud, reportedly faced a harrowing experience while incarcerated.  According to a former mobster turned federal informant, Gene Borrello, who shared a prison cell with Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto executive was placed on suicide watch and endured challenging conditions during his time at Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) while awaiting sentencing next year. FTX Co-Founder Subjected To Extortion The details emerged during an interview with crypto blogger Tiffany Fong, where Borrello disclosed the troubling circumstances surrounding Bankman-Fried&#8217;s imprisonment.  The former detainee recounted how Bankman-Fried was subjected to suicide watch, extortion attempts, and even periods of self-neglect, including refusing to eat or shower for several days. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Date Hinted By Expert: SEC Decision Expected January 5th – 10th, 2024 In an attempt to protect Bankman-Fried from potential harassment or extortion, authorities segregated him from gang members within the prison facility. However, despite these precautions, Borrello&#8217;s intervention reportedly foiled an extortion plot against the crypto mogul. Borrello further revealed that he prevented the extortionists from coercing Bankman-Fried into sharing a bunk with them, placing the FTX co-founder in a solitary wing. Additionally, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents reportedly requested his transfer to the solitary unit to ensure his safety. Drastic Change In Prison? Describing the physical and emotional toll on Bankman-Fried, Borrello highlighted the crypto executive&#8217;s frail appearance, likening it to that of an elderly man. Borrello stated on the matter: He has the body of an 80-year-old man. He has, like, no shape to him. When he talks to you, he puts his head down; he&#8217;s very timid, he talks very nervously.  Borrello also noted Bankman-Fried&#8217;s timid demeanor, with the co-founder displaying signs of nervousness during interactions.  In one conversation, Borrello confronted Bankman-Fried, stating that he had never been in a physical altercation before and questioned his association with gang members. As reported by our sister site, Bitcoinist, Bankman-Fried received unique treatment in prison, where he allegedly received special privileges for sharing cryptocurrency-related information with prison guards and fellow inmates. However, Borrello&#8217;s account offers a contrasting perspective, emphasizing the challenges and vulnerabilities the disgraced executive faced behind bars. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Retests Major Resistance Wall, Will Break Happen? As Bankman-Fried&#8217;s sentencing approaches, his time in prison, including allegations of bullying and the ultimate impact on his legal proceedings, continues to draw attention.  The revelations from Borrello&#8217;s interview provide a rare glimpse into the world of the disgraced FTX co-founder, and it remains to be seen what other revelations may be made in prison for Bankman-Fried as his sentencing trial looms in 2024. At present, the native token of FTX, FTT, is trading at $4.0997, indicating a decrease of 2.8% in the past 24 hours. However, it is noteworthy that the token has experienced a substantial surge of 216% year to date. Featured image from Shutterstock, a chart from TradingView.com "
