    "description": "The SEI token from the Sei Network has witnessed a remarkable 80% increase in value in the past week, as most of the leading cryptocurrencies drown in red amid wild speculations about the approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that wobbled the market. SEI&#8217;s strong performance today has put its governance token at the top of the crypto 100 listing on Coingecko. The coin&#8217;s¬†rally has been driven by the growing adoption of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compliant blockchains and the implementation of parallelization processes. An EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, serves as a digital platform for deploying smart contracts and Ethereum applications. An EVM-compliant blockchain refers to a network that has the capability to execute such applications. Related Reading: Cardano In 2024: Dollar Dream Or Downward Spiral For ADA?
