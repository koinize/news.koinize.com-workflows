Another example would be having a core DAO smart contract on Ethereum (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) while handling fully private voting on Sapphire, with end-results being sent back to the core DAO contract.</p><blockquote>“In this way the privacy capabilities of Sapphire are exposed to any other chain.”</blockquote><p>According to the Oasis Foundation director, the majority of DApps being developed on Oasis are privacy-centric and enable users with full control over their on-chain data to control how that gets shared and accessed. This is also evident in a list of different tools and platforms that have been built within the Oasis ecosystem.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/oasis-foundation-launches-160m-development-fund\"><strong><em>Related: Oasis Foundation launches $160M development fund</em></strong></a></p><p>Kos highlighted confidential decentralized exchanges, privacy-enabled blockchain gaming, account abstration, confidential NFTs, private voting, sealed-bid auctions, key management and decentralized identification as use cases that have come to the fore from builders on the Oasis chain.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ethereums-layer-2-zk-rollups-can-become-interoperable/\">Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
