The token's selloff in the week mirrored bearish sentiments across the top-ranking crypto assets, with Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) down 1.8% and 3.5%.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/097ed02d-7fc6-4ef0-8fde-8d4a55d3c7b1.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USD vs. BTC/USD and ETH/USD daily price performance chart.

XRP is no different.</p><p>For instance, the crypto market's total capitalization has dropped by over $32 billion since Hamas attacked Israel over the weekend. On the other hand, demand for traditional safe havens like the U.S. Treasuries and gold has jumped.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/c1b237c0-070f-44bd-93f8-1448cac9d85b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em> Crypto market vs. US 10-year Treasury and gold daily performance chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cryptocurrencies' immediate reaction to geopolitical conflicts have been mostly negative in the past. For instance, the crypto market's valuation dropped over 11% when the Russia- Ukraine conflict broke out Feb. 24, 2022. The market pared most of these losses shortly after. </p><h2>Big XRP inflows to crypto exchanges</h2><p>XRP's decline this week further coincides with massive token transfers over the weekend and at the week's beginning.</p><p>On Oct. 9, an address associated with Ripple <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1711252591407931703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">moved</a> 60 million XRP worth about $30 million to an unknown wallet, data resource Whale Alert updated.
