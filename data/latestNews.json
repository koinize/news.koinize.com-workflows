If the digital collection is stolen by others, the holder loses exclusive control,” jurists from SUPL say.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Although our country has not yet opened the secondary circulation market for NFTs, consumers can rely on the trading platform to complete operations such as purchase, collection, transfer, and destruction, and achieve exclusive possession, use, and disposal rights.”</p></blockquote><p>China has seen a rise in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-reason-chinas-war-on-crypto-3ac-judges-embarrassing-mistake-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >civil disputes</a> this year involving cryptocurrencies, with some courts ruling that virtual assets are protected by law, and others not.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/top-5-meme-coins-altcoin/",
    "description": "The altcoin market rally has been the talk of the crypto community lately and it has been with good reason. Amid this rapid rise of cryptocurrencies across the board, meme coins have been doing well. But just like any asset class, there are some that have performed better than others. CorgiAI (CORGIAI) Leads Meme Coins Gains CorgiAI (CORGIAI) is an interesting take on the Dog meme coins. But instead of using the widely popular Shiba Inu breed, the project chose the Corgi breed for their purposes and this seems to be working out well. In the last day, CorgiAI has dominated meme coin gains, rising over 56% in this time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99.35% Drop, Here’s Why Its figures on the 7-day chart are even more impressive, as data from CoinGecko shows that the asset rose $86.8 in just seven days. CorgiAI is now the 11th-largest meme coin in the space after its market cap crossed $36.29 million. Bonk (BONK): The Solana Altcoin Making Waves The Solana native Bonk (BONK) coin is one of the top meme coins after a massive run earlier in 2023. In the current ‘altcoin season’, it has performed very well, rising 29% in one day. Its 7-day gains are the closest to CorgiAI at 76.7%. On the shorter time frame, ie the 1-hour chart, BONK is actually outperforming the rest of the meme coins. Its price is already up 11.3% in the last hour at the time of this writing. This could suggest a further run in the near future for the meme con. HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (ETH) BITCOIN This meme coin is an embodiment of the most ridiculous parts of crypto and how anything can surge in the market. The coin which is the combination of popularly recognized names in pop culture, politics, and crypto started rising a few months ago, garnering a healthy following while at it. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Has Entered Markup Phase, Why This Is Important It moved rapidly enough that it is now one of the largest meme coins in the space, rising 19% in the last day alone. Despite seeing 2.5% losses on the weekly chart, its market cap is still sitting at $137.76 million, making it the 7th-largest meme coin by market cap. Dogelon Mars (ELON) Maintains Prominence Among Meme Coins This meme coin named after two of the most recognizable names when it comes to meme coins (Elon Musk and Dogecoin) has persisted even through the worst bear trends, and now it is continuing to show strength. Coming just behind HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (ETH) BITCOIN, ELON has recorded daily gains of 16.7%, with weekly gains of 14.4%. It currently holds the 8th position among the largest meme coins in the space. DOGE remains king of meme coins &#124; Source: DOGEUSDT on Tradingview.com Memecoin (MEME): New Kid On The Block Coming in 5th on this list is the newly released Memecoin (MEME). This meme coin was developed by the 9Gag team and initially saw a retracement on its launch gains. However, the tide is starting to turn as MEME’s 24-hour gains rise to 16.4%. Given that this is a new meme coin, there are currently no weekly figures. However, just like BONK, the meme coin is performing well on the hourly chart after rising 7.6% in the last hour at the time of this writing. Related Reading: Top 3 Altcoins For November 2023 That Could 100x Your Crypto Portfolio Top Meme Coins Didn’t Make The List The top meme coins in the space, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE), did not make the list of the outperforms. But that does not mean that they have not done well. As data from CoinGecko shows, all three of these cryptocurrencies are up at least 4% in the last day. DOGE has seen the lowest gains of the trio during this time with gains of 4%. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is on a higher level with 5.3% gains. PEPE is the best performer so far after rising 13.1% to reclaim the $0.0000013 level.
