They have sanctioned such activities and have also prosecuted and jailed the creators of Tornado Cash for carrying them out.</p><blockquote><strong>“In fact, we have written and published privacy guides that encourage mixing and promoted companies like Wasabi and Samourai. We believe that mixing is normal, privacy is not a crime, and that using unmixed Bitcoin is similar to bringing your whole paycheck to the grocery store to pay for an apple, “ Pritzker explained.</strong></blockquote><p>Pritzker noted that the current political climate has put a lot of fear into the banking sector, with most banks simply refusing to do business with anything in “crypto.” Thus, for them to continue their Bitcoin on-ramp services, their custody partner has to interact with banking services governed by FinCEN regulations.</p><p>In its letter to customers, Swan Bitcoin also suggested ways such policies can be opposed and said educating the masses on Bitcoin is the first step towards that.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/orange-pill-children-bitcoin-kids-books/\"><strong><em>Should you ‘orange pill’ children?
