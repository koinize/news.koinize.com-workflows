    "description": "Ethereum is currently looking to gain a strong footing above the $4,000 price level as bullish momentum continues to dominate. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this bullish momentum could continue and Ethereum could as well reach $5,000 very soon. Ali Martinez made this known while citing data from IntoTheBlock, noting that the second biggest cryptocurrency still has room to run to $5,000, albeit a small resistance around $4,522 to $4,646.  Ethereum Path To $5,000 Looks Increasingly Clear As Resistance Dwindles Ethereum&#8217;s momentum has been building for weeks amidst a broader crypto market increase, which has seen many cryptocurrencies reach new highs. The price of Ethereum has increased by 53% in the past 30 days alone, leaving investors to wonder how high it can keep going and whether it can follow in Bitcoin&#8217;s footsteps and attain a new all-time high.  Related Reading: Solana Demand Soars As Institutions Buy Up SOL At A Massive 870% Premium In a social media post on X, Martinez noted a $5,000 price point is in the books &#8220;as resistance thins.&#8221; However, a key hurdle remains at $4,522-$4,646, where 600,000 addresses hold 1.63 million ETH. Despite this resistance hurdle, Martinez believes a $5,000 price point is inevitable while noting that the only question left is when this will manifest. #Ethereum path to $5,000 looks increasingly clear, as resistance thins. The key hurdle? A supply zone at $4,522-$4,646, where 600,000 addresses hold 1.63 million $ETH. It&#8217;s not a matter of if, but when! pic.twitter.com/LMvw3kjrEW — Ali (@ali_charts) March 11, 2024 The analyst made this prediction using IntoTheBlock&#8217;s &#8220;In/Out of the Money Around Price&#8221; metric, which tracks the number of holders making money at the current price. Interestingly, the metric indicated that 7.64 million ETH, representing 75.95% of the volume bought between $3,428 and $4,646, are making money at the current price.  Ethereum is trading at $4,058 at the time of writing on the back of a minor correction after reaching a two-year high of $4,084. If bullish momentum continues and ETH can close the week above $4,175, that could pave the way for a quick move to $4,500 and potentially past its current all-time high of $4,891 to set a new one. Related Reading: Cardano Price About To Explode: Crypto Pundit Reveals Next Target Current price action shows Ethereum has created a support around $3,950 during its move up to $4,000. As long as this price level continues to hold, the overall bullish trend remains intact. But a break below $3,920 could signal a deeper correction to $3,800. Increased blockchain activity on layer-2 networks has pushed gas fees to new highs. As a result, developers are getting ready to roll in a Dencun upgrade, which is supposed to usher in a new era of cheaper fees. The Dencun upgrade is the first change to Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain code in over a year.  ETH price trending above $4,000 &#124; Source ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com"
