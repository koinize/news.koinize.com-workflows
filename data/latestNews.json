Circuit Court of Appeals decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, request the Appeals Court revisit its ruling, or <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">follow the court’s August order</a> and review Grayscale’s bid to change its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p><p>In an Oct. 12 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1712473704595406918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">post</a> responding to an X user's question, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balcunas said an appeal was unlikely, though there could still be other hurdles happening.</p><blockquote>“We think [an] appeal is a longshot [...] But there’s always a chance of something else happening.”</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, in a separate post, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that an SEC attempt to deny on new grounds was unlikely and a “very difficult needle to thread” but it could “find ways to keep delaying.”</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not officially.

Circuit,” wrote the firm.</p><p>Another delay scenario, according to Ropes &amp; Gray, would be if the New York Stock Exchange has to make a new filing to list GBTC — then it is possible the SEC could take up to eight months to reach a decision on the ETF.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-committee-chairman-threatens-sec-chair-subpoena-crypto\"><strong><em>House committee chairman threatens SEC chair with subpoena, but not over crypto</em></strong></a></p><p>Currently, at least seven spot Bitcoin ETF applications are before the regulator for approval. </p><p>Despite all being filed with the regulator earlier in 2023, all have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-spot-bitcoin-etfs-blackrock-bitwise-valkyrie-invesco\">faced delays</a> and pushbacks from the SEC leaving the final approval deadlines for most around March 2024 or later.</p><p>However, most eyes are on Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF conversion application because if the SEC approves it — the regulator could struggle to find reasons to knock back other applications.</p><p>The likelihood of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-chance-raised-after-grayscale-victory-bloomberg\">this year is 75%</a>, according to Bloomberg analysts who updated the odds after Grayscale’s court win.
