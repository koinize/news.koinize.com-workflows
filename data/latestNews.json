    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has witnessed high-value transactions again, leading to intrigue among its community. As significant amounts of SHIB change hands, many wonder if these moves signal a forthcoming positive shift in its market position or a rebound, as the asset is currently in a downtrend. Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking platform, disclosed that a¬†transaction of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, equating to approximately $38.39 million, moved from Bitvavo to an unidentified wallet. üö® üö® 4,653,778,173,637 #SHIB (38,391,343 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/KFZzJIvU5q ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 21, 2023 High-Value Transactions Coincide With Shibarium‚Äôs Developments It&#8217;s worth noting that this isn‚Äôt an isolated event. A similar transaction occurred just a day prior, where an almost equivalent amount of 4.6 trillion SHIB tokens (around $38.70 million) was transferred from one undisclosed wallet to another. üö® üö® 4,669,778,173,637 #SHIB (38,707,791 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/c6LPXZFq2h ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 20, 2023 These high-value transfers correlate with the start of Shibarium, the Ethereum-based layer-2 blockchain, which has been the cause of a spike in SHIB transactions. The surging activity, especially after introducing the Shibarium blockchain, naturally raised eyebrows within the Shiba Inu community.

SHIB Rebound On The Horizon? While it&#8217;s undeniable that there may be growing attention on Shiba Inu, especially after these whale activities and the Shibarium blockchain&#8217;s developments. It may be too soon to forecast the exact trajectory SHIB will take. However,¬†analyzing the Shiba Inu price chart suggests there could be a potential rebound, though it might not be imminent. On the 4-hour chart, Shiba Inu displays a pronounced downward wick. This indicates the presence of more liquidity in this downside range, which could suggest further decline as market makers may seek to capture this liquidity. To clarify, a wick refers to the thin line/vertical line above or below the main body of a candlestick. The wick represents an asset&#8217;s highest and lowest prices during a specific time frame, such as the candle marked above.

Such activities underscore their interest in adding to their SHIB holdings. This growing attention on SHIB is especially noteworthy given its recent Shibarium project launch.
