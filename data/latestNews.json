    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shibarium-activity-shib-burn-rate-bullish-signal-for-shiba-inu/",
    "description": "Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain linked to the widely recognized meme coin Shiba Inu, is making notable strides. Recent data indicates a significant uptick in user engagement, marked by a substantial increase in both transactions and wallet growth. The Shibariumscan explorer reveals that daily transaction volume on Shibarium has reached roughly 7.84 million, reflecting a steady climb since the beginning of the month. This uptrend in activity has propelled the total transactions on the platform to 212 million, accompanied by the connection of over 1.3 million Shibarium wallets, signifying a growing network of users. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves $45 Million In SHIB, Bullish? Shibarium&#8217;s Dynamic December: Wallet Growth Meets Fluctuating User Activity Despite the notable growth in wallets, there has been a contrasting trend in active user numbers. While the account numbers have swelled in December, active user engagement experienced a downturn during the same period. However, a slight rebound in active users was observed on December 27, hinting at a potential revival in participation. Particularly, Shibarium&#8217;s active users surged from a low of 1,878 as of December 23 to an high of 2,802 on the 27th. This pattern of fluctuating user activity, juxtaposed with the consistent increase in wallet numbers, paints a complex picture of Shibarium’s current ecosystem dynamics. Alongside Shibarium’s transactional growth, the Shiba Inu community has intensified its efforts in token incineration, aiming to reduce the circulating supply of SHIB tokens and potentially boost their value. The burn tracker Shibburn reports a 17.59% increase in the daily burn rate, with 13.7 million SHIB tokens recently burned. So far, December has witnessed the burning of roughly 24 billion Shiba Inu tokens, underscoring the community’s commitment to reducing SHIB’s supply. This consistent burning strategy is central to the community’s long-term goal of fostering token value growth through supply reduction. Shiba Inu Market Resilience Amid Security Warnings Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has thrived to continue its month-long bullishness. Despite a 1% decline in the past week, the asset currently shows an upward trajectory increasing by 0.8% in the past 24 hours, with a market price of $0.00001047, at the time of writing. In the midst of these developments, the ShibArmy Scam Alerts account on X has raised concerns about the prevalent issue of security in the crypto domain, particularly focusing on Shibarium. The account underscores the risks posed by fraudulent projects that exploit inexperienced investors through deceptive advertising.
