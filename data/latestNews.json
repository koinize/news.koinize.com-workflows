Chief among the complaints, many of which describe the company’s Intel Exchange as a “snitch-to-earn” or “snitching-as-a-service” program, involves Arkham's perceived role as a centralized intelligence agency.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fuck this.<br><br>It&#39;s not even the snitch-to-earn component that I&#39;m entirely against (it is useful as a decentralized whistleblowing dapp for public good).<br><br>The submissions end up on Arkham + Arkham Fnd is the central arbiter.<br><br>Someone should fork the contracts and decentralize this. <a href=\"https://t.co/hnfehiukd9\">https://t.co/hnfehiukd9</a></p>&mdash; Hudson Jameson (@hudsonjameson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/1678384583576891393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>As Arkham stated in its announcement thread, there are numerous positive use cases for the utilization of blockchain sleuths as information brokers. However, some experts are concerned about the potential for misuse that the exchange’s proposed business model appears to follow. </p><p>According to Arkham, users will be able to anonymously post and accept bounties for information concerning transactions on the blockchain. Once a bounty is completed, whatever entity paid out the bounty will have exclusive access to the data for a period of 90 days. Once the initial exclusivity period ends, Arkham says it will release the data to the public. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hey isn&#39;t the most profitable use of this just to put a bounty on whale wallets and then kidnap people? <br><br>like <br><br>did that come up in any meetings?</p>&mdash; farp (@farp_farp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/farp_farp/status/1678353108605468673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Other commenters wondered what considerations Arkham had given to the notion that a bounty marketplace could put a target on the backs of whales. </p><p>Alongside the announcements, Arkham’s been accused of leaking the email addresses of users who signed up for the company’s waitlist and then shared the link on social media. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ABSOLUTE LMAO.
