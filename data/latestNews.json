    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-buying-spree/",
    "description": "A recent development shows that Bitcoin whales have refused to be deterred by the recent price action of the flagship cryptocurrency. Instead, they have chosen to see it as an opportunity to accumulate more BTC. This move could turn out to be really profitable based on a recent analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez.  An Increase In Bitcoin Whales Ali Martinez stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that 46 new entities now hold 1,000 BTC or more, which represents a 3% increase in just two weeks. Data from BitInfoCharts further shows that there are now 1,898 wallet addresses holding this amount of Bitcoin or more. This is significant as it suggests that more people have become bullish on the crypto token despite the recent market correction.  Related Reading: Analysts Reveal Next Steps As Solana Corrects Hard After 1000% Rally These whales no doubt have enough reason to be bullish on BTC, as Martinez’s recent Bitcoin analysis suggests that the tide could turn soon enough. The analyst highlighted in an X post how, historically, price corrections for Bitcoin have “consistently been followed by further upside gains” in bull markets.  As such, he noted that dips like this might offer “strategic buying opportunities for those looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential growth.” Meanwhile, the Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have helped contribute to the increase in this figure, considering they have had to accumulate BTC for their respective funds. Data from on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows that the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, currently holds over 44,000 BTC for their Bitcoin ETF.  BTC price above $40,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Still Has More Bullish Momentum  While many in the crypto community continue to speculate whether the bull market is back, there is reason to believe that BTC&#8217;s bullish momentum is not fading anytime soon. In his most recent X post, Ali shared how the next market peak could land around 2025 if Bitcoin is to mirror past bull runs. Going by this projection, Bitcoin is said to have 600 days of bullish momentum still ahead.  Related Reading: Is XRP Price At $20 Possible? Crypto Analyst Predicts Stunning Move In the meantime, Bitcoin bulls will have to overcome the selling pressure from Bitcoin whales like Grayscale. The asset manager had to offload a significant portion of its BTC holdings due to the amount of outflows it keeps recording from its Spot Bitcoin ETF. GBTC investors like FTX are reported to be taking profits, considering that the fund had traded at a significant discount to Bitcoin’s price before now.   At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $39,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Milk Road, chart from Tradingview.com"
