At the post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/live-updates-fed-decision-september-2023.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">cautioned</a> that “the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2% has a long way to go.”</p><p>This possible scenario may have triggered the sell-off in the United States equities markets and also in the cryptocurrency space. Risk assets typically tend to underperform in a high-interest-rate environment. </p><p>While the S&amp;P 500 is down more than 2% and the Nasdaq about 3% this week, Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) has a remained flat.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/643d2f4f-6faa-4a08-8625-b0421f37e9e7.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: </em><a href=\"https://coin360.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>Coin360</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The altcoins have been unable to hold on to their intra-week gains due to a risk-off sentiment. Still, an encouraging sign is that Bitcoin and the major altcoins have largely managed to stay above their crucial support levels. The price action over the next few days is critical as it is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.</p><p>Will bears seize the initiative and drag Bitcoin and the major altcoins lower or could buyers regroup and push prices higher? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days. This tight-range trading indicates indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/9a0133ef-828a-484b-91c5-a9277a662a9b.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers are attempting to keep the BTC/USDT pair above the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,520). If the price rises from the current level, the bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at the 50-day simple moving average ($27,050). If they are successful, the pair could surge to the next resistance at $28,143.</p><p>In contrast, if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are back in command. That will increase the possibility of a retest of the pivotal support at $24,800.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1,628) on Sep. 20, indicating that the bears continue to sell on rallies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/f8f92b72-334a-475d-af78-cd2d0d836174.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to solidify their position further by pulling the price below the vital support at $1,530. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could start a downward move toward the next major support at $1,368.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off $1,530, it will suggest that lower levels are attracting buyers. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $1,670. That will clear the path for a potential rally to $1,745.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) turned down from $220 on Sep. 18 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($214) on Sep. 20. This suggests that the price may consolidate between $203 and $220 for a while longer.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/5dbed45b-571b-41b1-b71e-d2d3ff442cb7.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears will make one more attempt to tug the BNB/USDT pair below the crucial support at $203. If they succeed, it will indicate the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $183.</p><p>On the upside, the bulls will have to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($222) to signal a comeback. The pair could first rally to $235 and subsequently attempt an up-move to $250. This level is expected to attract sellers.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.51) on Sep. 19 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the recovery. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/8fdeaf2a-496c-4a2f-b9f6-ef71efe950e5.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The price has again dropped to the 20-day EMA, which is an important support to keep an eye on. If the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to kick the price above the overhead zone between the 50-day SMA ($0.53) and $0.56. </p><p>On the contrary, if the 20-day EMA gives way, the pair could fall to the uptrend line. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it will invalidate the bullish pattern.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) price action of the past few days has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close below $0.24.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/787ec3f2-c48c-48e7-8f7c-6f7a02c826db.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The gradually downsloping moving averages suggest advantage to bears but the bullish divergence on the RSI indicates that the bearish momentum may be slowing down. Buyers will have to quickly shove the price above the downtrend line to prevent a breakdown. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair will be well-positioned for a relief rally to $0.30.</p><p>If the price continues lower and breaks below $0.24, it will complete the bearish setup and set the stage for a fall to $0.22 and eventually to the pattern target of $0.19.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.06) on Sep. 21, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/3e6dc402-471f-463b-8674-9e53bce6f6a3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>However, the bears have not been able to strengthen their position by yanking the price below the formidable support at $0.06. This suggests that the bulls are buying on dips. The DOGE/USDT pair may swing between $0.06 and the 20-day EMA for some more time.</p><p>If bulls kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate the start of a sustained recovery to the 50-day SMA ($0.07) and then to $0.08. On the downside, if the $0.06 level cracks, the pair risks a potential decline to $0.055.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) rose above the 20-day EMA ($19.57) on Sep. 18 but the bulls could not push the price to the 50-day SMA ($21.01). This suggests that the bears are active at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/28dc7c1a-84c9-496d-8b8b-4c37b5edd72e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the sellers sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could slump to $18.50 and thereafter to the next support at $17.33.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-all-time-high-argentina-hyperinflation-outpaces-gains\"><strong><em>Bitcoin blasts past its 2021 all-time high in Argentina, but hyperinflation outpaces gains</em></strong></a></p><p>On the other hand, if the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That could increase the possibility of a retest of the overhead resistance zone between the 50-day SMA and $22.30.</p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin’s (TON) failure to rise above $2.59 on Sep. 19 and 20 may have tempted short-term traders to book profits. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/c582889f-c6fe-466c-acab-6395dc51a4e4.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ALTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The immediate support on the downside is at $2.25. If this level is violated, the TON/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2.08). If bulls want to retain the positive sentiment, they must defend this level. A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA could keep the pair stuck inside the large range between $2.07 and $2.59.</p><p>Another possibility is that the price snaps back from $2.25. If that happens, it will suggest that traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. That will increase the likelihood of a break above $2.59. The pair may then jump to $2.90. </p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>The bears are fiercely guarding the breakdown level of $4.22 in Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>), indicating that every minor relief rally is being sold into.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/db17532c-ce8f-462e-ac22-8b8ce80d9804.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOTUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the bears have the upper hand. If the price continues lower and skids below $3.90, it will suggest the start of the next leg of the downtrend toward $3.58.</p><p>A minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that the RSI is showing early signs of forming a positive divergence. This suggests that the selling pressure could be reducing. A break and close above $4.22 will open the doors for a possible rally to the downtrend line.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) closed above the 20-day EMA ($0.54) on Sep. 19 but the bulls failed to build upon the momentum. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/e56a9cb6-e267-444c-b98a-a4199b6f23b0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AMATICUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA on Sep. 21. The sellers will try to sink the pair below the strong support at $0.49. If they manage to do that, the MATIC/USDT pair could resume its downtrend. The next support on the downside is $0.45.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price rebounds of the $0.50 support with strength, it will suggest that lower levels are attracting buyers. The bulls will have to propel and sustain the price above $0.55 to signal the start of a stronger recovery.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
