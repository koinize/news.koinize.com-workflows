The automated researcher would, in theory, help the team manage superintelligence safety and align it with “human intent.”</p><p>Currently, it named its own chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and the research lab's head of alignment Jan Leike as the co-leaders of the effort.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/cftc-finds-former-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-broke-number-of-us-rules",
    "description": "<p>Investigators from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have concluded that Celsius and its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky broke several US laws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It has emerged that if a majority of commissioners from the CFTC agree with the conclusion, then the regulator could file a case against Mashinsky in federal court later this month.&nbsp;</p>\nMashinsky Broke Rules&nbsp;\n<p>The United States Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced the conclusion of its probe into Celsius Network. According to attorneys from the regulator&rsquo;s enforcement unit, Celsius and Mashinsky deliberately misled investors and broke several of the country&rsquo;s investment laws before the firm&rsquo;s eventual collapse in 2022. The CFTC revelations come a year after Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and left thousands of customers, creditors, and investors in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The New York Attorney General had sued Mashinsky on the 5th of January, 2023, alleging that the former Celsius CEO had misled investors, resulting in losses of billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform @CelsiusNetwork for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. Alex Mashinsky lied to people about the risks of investing in Celsius, hid its deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The New York Attorney General stated at the time that Mashinsky had defrauded investors, including 26,000 residents of New York State, out of billions of dollars worth of crypto. She added that Mashinsky&rsquo;s actions leading up to the Celsius bankruptcy led to significant investor losses as he misrepresented the platform&rsquo;s financial condition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. &ldquo;The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses.&rdquo;</p>\n\nCFTC Could File Lawsuit Against Celsius&nbsp;\n<p>According to reports, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission attorneys believe that Celsius misled investors. They also added that the crypto lender should have registered itself with the CFTC. According to sources close to the matter, the CFTC could initiate the filing of a federal case against Celsius if a majority of its commissioners agree with the conclusion that the crypto lender misled investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Court filings have also revealed that the bankrupt crypto lender was under scrutiny from several federal agencies. These include the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), The Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division, and the Massachusetts Securities Division. As a result of these developments, the platform&rsquo;s native CEL token has seen a 12% drop in value. Currently, the token is trading at $0.15.&nbsp;</p>\nFahrenheit To Acquire Celsius Assets&nbsp;\n<p>Meanwhile, it was revealed last month that crypto consortium Fahrenheit won the bid to acquire Celsius Network&rsquo;s assets after a successful bid. Fahrenheit beat fellow bidder NovaWulf, while the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC) was shortlisted as a backup. Fahrenheit&rsquo;s winning consortium was backed by mining company US Bitcoin Corp, Arrington Capital, Ravi Kaza, Steven Kokinos, and Proof Group. Court filings revealed that Celsius Network&rsquo;s assets were previously valued at $2 billion. The successful bid will see Fahrenheit acquire Celsius&rsquo;s institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, mining units, and additional alternative investments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-cash-bch-registers-28-gain-how-long-with-it-last/",
    "description": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is captivating the attention of the crypto community with its ongoing price surge. The recent inclusion of BCH on EDX, a Citadel Securities-backed crypto exchange, has sparked fresh interest in this digital asset.  As investors eagerly monitor its progress, the price of BCH on CoinGecko stands at $291.80, showcasing a 24-hour rally of nearly 7% and an impressive seven-day surge of 27.5%. Source: Coingecko The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has contributed to the positive trajectory of BCH. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, investors are seeking alternatives beyond the traditional giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and BCH has emerged as a viable contender. However, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether Bitcoin Cash can sustain its current bullish streak. BCH Whales Pause Buying Spree Amidst Price Surge While the recent listing on EDX has undoubtedly played a part in this rally, on-chain data reveals an intriguing aspect of the price surge. A cluster of Bitcoin Cash whales holding significant amounts of 1 million to 10 million coins has emerged as a pivotal player in driving last month’s rally. Source: Santiment Between June 21 and June 30, these BCH whales accumulated 170,000 coins, which amounted to approximately $52.4 million in value. Their substantial purchases had a significant impact on the asset&#8217;s price, as whales possess substantial financial power and strategic influence on other investors. When whales buy more coins, it often leads to an increase in the asset&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why However, an interesting development emerged in July. The same cluster of BCH whales, who were actively accumulating coins during the June rally, has conspicuously paused their buying spree. Specifically, between July 1 and July 4, their total BCH balances remained relatively stable, hovering around 1.51 million coins. BCH market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Future Trajectory Of Bitcoin Cash The whales&#8217; decision to halt their buying activity raises questions about the current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin Cash. Are these whales taking a cautious approach, waiting to assess the market before making further moves? Or does their pause indicate a temporary lull in the BCH price surge? Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Understanding the behavior of large-scale investors such as whales is essential in predicting market trends. Their actions often influence the sentiments and decisions of other traders and investors. The temporary pause in their buying activity could potentially impact the short-term price dynamics of Bitcoin Cash. As the market eagerly watches Bitcoin Cash, the question arises as to whether the recent price surge can be sustained without the continued support of these influential whales. The coming weeks will shed light on the market&#8217;s overall sentiment and the role these whales will play in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin Cash.
