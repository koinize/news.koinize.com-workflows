    "description": "<p>Despite the latest crypto market recovery, Polkadot (DOT) has been trading in the red region losing all its gains from the beginning of 2023. The charts have shown a notable decline in the price of Polkadot, leaving investors curious about its future trajectory. However, analysts have predicted that another token, Tradecurve (TCRV), will lead the next crypto bull run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nPolkadot (DOT) Price Analysis: Why Is Polkadot Going Down?\n<p>Over the past week, the price of Polkadot l has been range-bound, fluctuating between $5.00 and $5.50.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the launch of Polkadot 2.0, the token has faced significant bearish pressure, evident in the long wick on its July 6th candlestick, suggesting selling pressure during intraday rallies. According to CoinMarketCap, the current price of Polkadot stands at $5.12, reflecting a 6.34% decline over the past seven days.</p>\n<p>Although Polkadot's price has dipped below the moving averages recently, there are indications of a potential recovery as the token experiences a modest 0.88% increase in the last 24 hours. Moreover, trading volume on the network has witnessed an 8.30% surge within the past 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Currently, Polkadot has surpassed the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $5.05, yet it still remains below the 200-Day SMA at $5.72.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A positive sign would be a breakout above the $5.15 mark, signaling solid demand. In such a scenario, the bulls would likely attempt to drive the pair towards $5.64. On the downside, if bearish pressure lingers, the token could drop to $4.74.</p>\n<p></p>\nTradecurve (TCRV) To Lead The Next Crypto Bull Run\n<p>As Polkadot gears up for a rebound, market experts have predicted that Tradecurve could lead the next crypto bull run, surpassing the likes of Bitcoin. The market's belief in the potential of Tradecurve stems from its plan to bridge the crypto and traditional financial sector.</p>\nWhy Tradecurve (TCRV) Can Rally By 100X\n<p>While platforms like Binance and Coinbase already offer derivative options and futures for cryptocurrencies, Tradecurve seeks to expand this offering by incorporating a wide range of instruments from the traditional financial market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These instruments encompass commodities, indices, stocks, ETFs, forex, and cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to access a more diverse and comprehensive portfolio. Tradecurve gains the ability to tap into the OTC derivatives market worth over $632 trillion in 2022. It does so by introducing derivatives tied to traditional financial instruments,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tradecurve also has other features like copy trading, AI algorithmic trading, high leverage, and a metaverse trading academy. Tradecurve has attracted significant attention. This is with a projected price surge of 50x during the presale phase and up to 100x upon the launch of the trading platform,&nbsp;</p>\nExperts Opinion: Time To Take Advantage\n<p>Currently trading at $0.018, a 100X price increase could propel the token's value to $1.8, potentially propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization before the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Savvy investors have recognized the opportunity and have already acquired millions of TCRV tokens, positioning themselves early for potential gains.</p>\n<p>Visit the links below to get more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token:</p>\n<p>Click Here For the Website</p>\n<p>Click Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens</p>\n<p>Follow Us Twitter</p>\n<p>Join Our Community on Telegram</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-realized-cap-nears-400b-price-reclaims/",
    "description": "Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s current struggle to surpass the $30,000 mark, data analytics firmÂ Glassnode earlier today reported that the asset&#8217;s realized capitalization has since been on an upward trajectory, nearing the $400 billion mark. Bitcoin Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion According to Data analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap is now inching closer to $400 billion, showing that new capital is continuously entering the market despite the year&#8217;s ups and downs.Â  Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Minersâ€™ Reduced Selling Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap represents the total value of all BTC at the price they were last moved or transacted, indicating the cost basis of holders. When this metric rises, it reveals that BTC is being traded at progressively higher prices, which suggests an increase in demand. Glassnode reported that the increase in BTC&#8217;s realized cap signals the consistent influx of capital into the asset throughout the year 2023. This steady inflow represents a stable investment climate surrounding Bitcoin, despite its recent price fluctuations. Furthermore, Glassnode&#8217;s assessment of the ascending realized cap is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. The data analytics firms said, &#8220;It signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net,&#8221; &#8211; a phenomenon that underlines a rising demand for Bitcoin. It is worth noting that this recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin comes at a time the asset might have flashed a hope of bullish moves following the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF filings and financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the largest asset by market cap. BTC Struggles To Push Past $30,000 Meanwhile, as Bitcoin realized&#8217;s cap is approaching $400 billion, the asset has struggled to make a significant move above the $30,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours alone, the BTC price has traded both below and above the $30,000 mark, suggesting a level of consolidation at this point. Particularly, the asset currently has a 24-hour high of $30,292 and a 24-hour low of $29,792, at the time of writing. However, regardless of that, BTC is currently down by only a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $29,882.Â  This latest price action follows Bitcoin&#8217;s quick spike which was seen last week on July 13. This surge brought Bitcoin price to trade even above the $31,000 mark before briefly slipping below $30,000. Over the past few days, however, a total of more than $30 billion has been removed from the BTC market cap. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Founder Anticipates BTC Price Surge Due To This Reason The asset&#8217;s market cap has plunged from a high of $614 billion seen on July 13 to $583 billion, as of today. Additionally, BTC trading volume has also declined in the past week indicating less trading activity. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView"
