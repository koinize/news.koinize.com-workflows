    "description": "The crypto analyst who correctly called Dogwifhat’s (WIF) parabolic run has identified another Solana-based meme coin that could see a significant move to the upside. The analyst further suggested that WIF and this crypto token have striking similarities.  A ‘God Candle’ Incoming For Myro Meme Coin Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it won’t be long before the Myro (MYRO) token sees a god candle. The analyst added that everyone would wish they had bought the meme coin when it finally breaks its current all-time high of $0.4 and “starts doing rapid multiples.” Related Reading: Brace For Impact: MicroStrategy Is Planning Another $500 Million Bitcoin Purchase In a previous X post, Bluntz had suggested that MYRO is the next Solana-based meme coin to take off following WIF’s run to the top. The analyst had correctly predicted that WIF would attain the heights it is currently at right from when it was still trading at around $0.29. Back then, he stated that the meme coin would go “turbo parabolic.” Bluntz suggested that MYRO could follow a similar trajectory to WIF’s rise as he highlighted that both meme coins have the same chart pattern. MYRO, making a similar run to WIFs, could see it become the latest meme coin to join the billion-dollar club in terms of market cap. MYRO’s market cap currently stands at $340 million.  Meanwhile, Bluntz isn’t the only analyst that MYRO could see a parabolic price surge soon enough. Crypto analyst Crypto Shadow also hinted that the meme coin will likely go “parabolic” soon enough. He believes this move to the upside will see MYRO rank with top meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and FLOKI.  Solana-Based WIF’s Insane Run WIF, another Solana-based meme coin, is currently having an insane run, similar to the kind of run other top meme coins like DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) enjoyed during their breakout year in 2021. As a result, WIF is currently enjoying a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 1,700%, making it one of the most profitable crypto tokens since the beginning of 2024.  Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Why XRP Is Primed For Growth In This Bull Market WIF’s run has also seen it surpass BONK as the most valuable Solana meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $3 billion to BONK’s $2 billion. WIF now ranks as the fourth-largest by market cap, behind DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. However, if it somehow sustains this bullish momentum, it could soon surpass PEPE.  Bluntz previously mentioned that WIF will flip at least two meme coins in this market cycle (it already flipped BONK) and further suggested that it could rise to become the second most valuable meme coin, only behind DOGE.  MYRO price at $0.32 &#124; Source: MYROUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"
