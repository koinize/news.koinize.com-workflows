The last time cryptocurrency traded above this mark was on Nov. 12, 2021, when Bitcoin started its reversal, falling over 67% to the macro low of $19,297 at the beginning of April 2022. Bitcoins bullish momentum came two days after the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke an all-time high of $2.4 billion in daily trading volume on Feb. 26. The new nine spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded combined trading volumes of over $2 billion for at least two days over the week.</p><p>The United States government <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/u-s-gov-moves-922-million-seized-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">transferred $922 million worth of Bitcoin</a> from two cryptocurrency wallets that held funds seized from Bitfinex in 2016. The transfers occurred the same day Bitcoin (BTC) breached $60,000 for the first time in over two years on Feb. 28. The government seized the funds in 2016 after Bitfinex was hacked for approximately 119,754 BTC, worth over $7.4 billion at its current price. The hacker, Ilya Lichtenstein, laundered over $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin from Bitfinex. Lichtenstein and his rapper wife, Heather Morgan (also known as Razzlekhan), were arrested in February 2022.</p><p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and the New York State Department of Financial Services <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gemini-refund-earn-customers-in-settlement-new-york-financial-regulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">have reached a settlement</a> that will see Gemini return at least $1.1 billion to customers of the Gemini Earn program through the Genesis bankruptcy proceeding. Gemini will also pay a $37 million penalty for multiple compliance failures that threatened the safety and soundness of the company, Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris of the NYDFS explained in a Feb. 28 statement. If approved by the bankruptcy court, Gemini said it expects Earn users to receive 100% of their cryptocurrency assets back plus appreciation on top of that.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-60k-us-govt-moves-seized-btc-sbf-sentencing-hodlers-digest-feb-25-march-2/\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
