    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-can-reach-165/",
    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is currently riding on the back of a 14% gain in the past seven days, allowing the cryptocurrency to break past the $0.70 price level for the first time since May 2022. According to crypto exchange Changelly, Cardano is poised to continue on this price growth and break over $1, $10, and $100 in the coming years and decades. Changelly Predicts Exponential Cardano Price Growth Cardano is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap with a cap of over $23.5 billion. Although ADA has since retraced some of its gains earlier in the week and is now trading below $0.77, it ended February with a 35% gain amidst a wider inflow of money into the crypto market. Current fundamentals have prompted experts to forecast a continued price surge in March. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Why Bitcoin Can Rise To $400,000 According to Changelly&#8217;s prediction, ADA will continue on this price growth to make a steadfast breakout above $0.70 and end the month at a maximum of $0.751. Notably, analysts at the exchange also looked at future price points for ADA, predicting very bullish prices. In its prediction, the exchange noted ADA would break over $10 in 2030. With the cryptocurrency now trading at $0.66, this would mean a 1,400% growth from the current price level. Looking further into the future, Changelly expects this price growth to continue into the next decade, allowing ADA to eventually break over $165 by 2040 and end the year around $600. How Feasible Is This Bullish Prediction? Cardano has had its fair share of ups and downs in the past few years. Recently, the blockchain network saw a 90% jump in the creation of new wallet addresses, indicating increased network activity and interest in the network. However, the blockchain has also been subjected to negative remarks, with multiple reports hinting that Cardano&#8217;s network activity has been nothing but fabrications. Particularly, a recent report termed ADA as a dead coin. Related Reading: Bitwise CEO Says Bitcoin At $250,000 Is Closer Than You Think Despite this, some holders and experts remain optimistic. For ADA to cross over $10 and $100 per coin, mainstream adoption needs to happen. As the crypto industry, which is spearheaded by Bitcoin, becomes more mainstream, Cardano is poised to benefit from greater adoption. While $165 per ADA sounds overly optimistic now, if Cardano can achieve its ambitious goals, gain mainstream interest and adoption, and attract institutional investment from traditional investors, that price target may not be so unrealistic after all. At the same time, this isn&#8217;t impossible, as ADA has delivered over 3,000% profit for its holders in the past.
