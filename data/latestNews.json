The deal also says that: </p><p>“A writer can choose to use AI when performing writing services if the company consents and provided that the writer follows applicable company policies, but the company can’t require the writer to use AI software (e.g. ChatGPT) when performing writing services.”</p><p>Ellen Stutzman, one of the chiefs of the WGA, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/09/writers-guild-leaders-interview-end-of-strike-1235557011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> that prior to going on strike, AI terms were ones that studios “refused to negotiate” prior to the strike. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/u-s-judge-denies-copyright-for-ai-art\"><strong><em>US judge rules in favor of human ingenuity, denies copyright for AI art</em></strong></a></p><p>Additionally, companies must be transparent with writers when AI-generated content is given to them or incorporated into a project. The WGA says it “reserves the right to assert that exploitation of writers’ material to train AI is prohibited by MBA or other law.”</p><p>The most recent agreements affect the WGA, which was one of the two entertainment unions on strike. SAG-AFTRA, the other striking union, represents actors and other “media professionals.” This union joined the WGA on July 14, 2023 and is currently still striking. </p><p>AI is one of the main components SAG-AFTRA is fighting against as well. The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-proposal-sparks-conflict-hollywood-sag-aftra-goes-strike\">AI proposal from studios</a> suggested scanning of background performers, for which they would only receive a single day’s payment. Subsequently, they would grant companies full ownership over the scan, their image, and likeness.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-killed-translation-industry-easytranslate-boss-change-human-jobs/\"><strong><em>‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
