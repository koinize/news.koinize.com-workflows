Another person with knowledge of the plans said the company has already explored one bot that speaks like the former United States president Abraham Lincoln and another for travel advice that speaks like a surfer. </p><p>According to the sources from the FT, the purpose of the chatbots will be both to offer recommendations and new search functionality, along with being a “fun product for people to play with.”</p><p>Cointelegraph has contacted Meta for further comment on the matter and has received no response at the time of writing. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/llama-2-open-source-ai-model-launched-by-meta-microsoft\"><strong><em>Meta and Microsoft launch open-source AI model Llama 2</em></strong></a></p><p>The FT source said that the company may automate checks on the chatbots’ outputs to ensure accuracy and avoid rule-breaking speech. </p><p>This development comes as Meta has allocated major efforts toward user retention. During its 2023 second-quarter earnings call on July 26, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about the company’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tiktok-rival-twitter-threads-text-posts-feature-launch\">latest product and Twitter rival</a>, Threads.</p><p>He said that he is “seeing more people coming back daily than I’d expected.” It was in this call Zuckerberg said Meta was<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-second-quarter-earnings-reality-labs-metaverse-loss\"> primarily focused on Threads </a>user retention. The earnings call also revealed another $3.7 billion invested into metaverse development. </p><p>The introduction of accessible chatbots also means an opportunity to collect large amounts of user data. OpenAI, the maker of the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, has been hit with a class-action lawsuit over alleged data theft via its own bots. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-human-digital-souls-agi-alignment-problem-replika/\"><strong><em>Experts want to give AI human ‘souls’ so they don’t kill us all</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
