The first is the development of common standards and interoperability between wholesale CBDCs and legacy systems. The second one, promoted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), is the development of regional or global CBDC platforms. Wholesale CBDCs could be standardized to be exchanged directly on these platforms and perform payment versus payment and delivery versus payment transactions.</p><p>The First Deputy Governor nods at the example of Project Mariana, which explored the possibilities of an automated market maker (AMM). The project, involving the Banque de France, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Swiss National Bank, was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-bis-france-singapore-switzerland-test\">successfully finished in late September</a>. </p><p>The official talked not only about the CBDCs but also about the tokenization of finance. He expressed his belief that the public sector must support the private sector more than ever to enable the full potential of blockchain while limiting the risks. In his conviction, tokenized “central bank money availability” and tokenized assets are allies rather than competitors.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
