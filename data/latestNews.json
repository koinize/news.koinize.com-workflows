    "description": "Ethereum price rallied steadily and surpassed the $2,000 resistance. ETH is consolidating above $2,000 and might start a fresh increase toward $2,120. Ethereum rallied above the $2,000 and $2,050 levels before it corrected lower. The price is trading above $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel forming with support near $2,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2,085 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Holds Support This past week, we saw a strong increase in Ethereum above the $2,000 level. ETH outperformed Bitcoin and cleared many hurdles near the $2,050 level. It traded to a new multi-week high at $2,137 before there was a downside correction. The price declined below the $2,080 level. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,906 swing low to the $2,137 high. Ethereum is still trading above $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key declining channel forming with support near $2,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,060 level and the channel region. The next major resistance sits at $2,085, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, the price could rally toward the $2,120 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,150, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,200 level. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,085 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,025 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,906 swing low to the $2,137 high. The next key support is $2,000 and the channel zone. A downside break below the $2,000 support might spark bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,930 support zone in the near term. Any more losses might call for a drop toward the $1,850 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Level – $2,000 Major Resistance Level – $2,085"
