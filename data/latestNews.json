    "description": "Mt. Gox, the infamous Bitcoin exchange that suffered a major hack over a decade ago, has allegedly finally begun the process of repaying its customers for the 850,000 lost Bitcoin. This news has sent shockwaves through the market, causing a momentary disruption in the Bitcoin price uptrend. As a result of these developments, the current price of Bitcoin stands at $42,625, with a 24-hour trading volume of $22,655,498,534.64.  However, the market has witnessed a -2.40% decline in the past 24 hours, reflecting the uncertainty caused by the Mt. Gox repayment proceedings. Bitcoin Price Plunges Amidst Mounting Speculation Reports from participants in the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit group indicate that some individuals have already received payouts in yen via PayPal.  However, those who opted for cash deposits into their bank accounts have not reported any inflows as of yet. Several users have shared notifications they received, alerting them to a system error that resulted in double payments.  These users are now allegedly being requested to return the excess funds to the Rehabilitation Trustee promptly. Moreover, the Rehabilitation Trustee has reached out to affected individuals to refund the mistakenly transferred amount, which was the second transfer, as the first transfer was the official repayment.  Related Reading: Ethereum: Balancing Act At $2,300 – Scaling The Heights Or Facing A Looming Drop? Users have been instructed to use PayPal&#8217;s &#8220;Refund&#8221; feature to return the funds to the Rehabilitation Trustee&#8217;s account. Alternatively, they can transfer an equivalent amount of money to the Rehabilitation Trustee&#8217;s PayPal account if the &#8220;Refund&#8221; feature is unavailable. While some users have confirmed receiving their repayments, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing of Bitcoin reimbursements or if they are taking effect. No Bitcoin Outflows Detected From Mt. Gox? In a recent statement by CryptoQuant co-founder and CEO, Ki Young Ju, it has been confirmed that &#8220;no Bitcoin outflows have been recorded from the Mt. Gox Trustee wallet at this time.&#8221;  Furthermore, the trustee responsible for managing the rehabilitation proceedings of Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange, has yet to provide any official statements explaining the absence of outflows from the wallet.  Consequently, the cryptocurrency community finds itself on edge, eagerly awaiting updates regarding the timing and method of Bitcoin reimbursements.

Gox exchange repayment to its customers.  The spread of this news has had a notable impact on market sentiment and has stirred volatility in the Bitcoin price. The future timeline and potential effects of the exchange&#8217;s repayment, slated for 2024, remain uncertain. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com  "
