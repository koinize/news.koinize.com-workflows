    "description": "As the entire cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a notable upward trajectory, several market analysts are anticipating more gains for Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency asset, as they predict the token&#8217;s price to go even higher. Historical Trend That Will Send Bitcoin To $60,000  Crypto Jelle, a cryptocurrency analyst and investor, has expressed his optimism toward Bitcoin&#8217;s price action. Jelle recently shared a positive prediction for BTC in the near future on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin At $100,000 Not Far Off, Here’s When The expert&#8217;s projections delve into the present price movement of Bitcoin and its potential to increase even further. He highlighted a trend which serves as a catalyst for a price increase. Jelle&#8217;s X post was accompanied by a chart that shows that the crypto asset has formed a &#8220;Bullish Megaphone&#8221; pattern. According to him, this is &#8220;yet another bullish megaphone pattern,&#8221; suggesting the price will go higher, putting his price target at $60,000. If Bitcoin manages to maintain its current momentum amid the crypto market&#8217;s rally, it is possible that BTC&#8217;s price might reach $60,000. In another X post, Jelle also pointed out that the token is presently in an area in which it normally sees the best gains. Jelle revealed that the BTC always experiences the best return when its &#8220;weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 70.&#8221; Due to this, he has urged his thousands of followers to invest significantly in the token to position themselves for more gains. BTC finished the previous week on a bullish note, staying put above the $52,000 threshold in the face of strong opposition. This simply suggests a strong faith and dependency on the digital asset from investors. After going past the $52,000 level, it set a new weekly culmination record spanning two years. Because of Bitcoin&#8217;s tenacity and upward movement, investors and market watchers are anticipating what lies ahead. Massive Whale Moves Amid Price Rally In light of BTC&#8217;s rally, Whale Alert has reported massive whale transactions carried out hours ago. Whale Alert revealed that around 18,484 BTC valued at about $962 million were taken out of the decentralized exchange Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Increase Holdings By 4.5%, Getting Ready For Rally? The on-chain tracker reported that the aforementioned withdrawals were carried out in two distinct transactions. Whale Alert noted that the first transaction saw 9,322 BTC worth approximately $485 million being withdrawn from Coinbase. Meanwhile, the second transaction witnessed 9,162 BTC valued at about $476 million being extracted from the same exchange. Both wallet addresses involved in the withdrawal appear to be new ones, as they had no previous transaction history. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $52,336, indicating an increase of over 9% in the past 7 days. Despite the price rise, its trading volume appears to be down by over 10% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
