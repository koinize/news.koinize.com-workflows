    "description": "<p>Republican lawmakers Patrick McHenry and Glen Thompson have introduced a draft bill proposing clear roles and delineation of authority between the SEC and CFTC regarding crypto.&nbsp;</p>\nA Clearer Regulatory Plan&nbsp;\n<p>The draft bill, released on Friday, provides crypto assets and exchanges a clearer regulatory plan, enabling the trading of digital assets on more conventional trading platforms. It also seeks to introduce a division of authority between the two top US financial regulators. The draft, published on the 2nd of June, 2023, proposes establishing a functional framework that provides regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency firms and exchanges operating in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Key House Republicans Unveil Crypto Market Structure Draft Bill The draft legislation was unveiled today by House Financial Services Committee Chairman @PatrickMcHenry and House Agriculture Committee Chairman @CongressmanGT.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The bill would prohibit the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from denying digital asset trading platforms from registering as a regulated alternative trading system. It would also allow the firms in question to offer payment stablecoins and digital commodities. The bill cracks down on the much-criticized approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which does not offer any clear rules or roadmap for the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under the bill&rsquo;s framework, specific digital assets could qualify as digital commodities if they were functional and considered decentralized assets. It would also require the SEC to provide a complete and detailed analysis of any objections against the classification of a firm as decentralized. The draft states,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Act also requires the SEC to modify its rules to allow broker-dealers to custody digital assets if they meet certain requirements. Additionally, the Act would require the SEC to write rules to modernize certain regulations for digital assets.&rdquo;</p>\n\nCrypto Space Lauds Draft Bill&nbsp;\n<p>The crypto space praised the bill and initiative. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that the draft bill lays a strong foundation for regulatory jurisdictions and definitions. However, he added that the bill needed an in-depth review before being formally introduced. Coinbase has recently launched a pro-adoption ad campaign as it looks to attend a lobbying-focused event to be held in Washington DC, in July.</p>\n<p>However, the bill was introduced by Republican lawmakers and lacks any input from the Democrats. Both Democrats and Republicans have, at times, shown a willingness to take a bipartisan approach to crypto regulation. It is not clear how the proposed legislation would perform in a highly divided Congress. The US House and Senate have recently passed legislation that would stop the government from going into default. The legislation raises the debt ceiling, with President Biden expected to sign the bill into law by the 2nd of June.&nbsp;</p>\nSEC vs. Crypto&nbsp;\n<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the United States have long been calling for regulatory clarity as they grapple with enforcement action from regulators. As a result, many are moving to shift operations outside the United States of America. Prominent exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase have announced off-shore operations. Coinbase is also locked in a courtroom battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it received a Wells notice earlier in the year. A Wells notice is a warning of impending enforcement action.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/whales-arb-accumulation-boosts-token/",
    "description": "Arbitrum (ARB), a prominent governance token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, recently witnessed a decent surge in price following renewed buying activity from a well-known DeFi whale address.  Large-scale investors often influence market sentiment and can significantly impact the price of a given asset. However, as the rally unfolds, questions arise about the sustainability of this upward momentum and its implications for the future of Arbitrum. Related Reading: Floki Inu Gains Momentum As Chinese E-Commerce Giant Recognizes Its Utility Whale’s Unusual Buying Activity Coincides With ARB’s Rally Arbitrum&#8217;s (ARB) current price of $1.24 on CoinMarketCap highlights its remarkable performance, with a noteworthy 3.4% rally witnessed within the past 24 hours, followed by an impressive seven-day climb of 7%. Interestingly, this surge in value coincided with unusual buying activity associated with renowned trader Andrew Kang&#8217;s crypto addresses. Source: CoinMarketCap Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, has been making some interesting movements within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Kang put $1 million worth of stablecoins into Arbitrum pools and allocated nearly a quarter of the funds to the purchase of RDNT tokens. RDNT is the native token of the DeFi lending platform Radiant Capital. BTCUSD currently trading at $27,150 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: XRP $1 Threshold On The Horizon? Noted Trader Fuels Speculation After filling his bags with RDNT, Kang subsequently exchanged his newly acquired tokens and existing RDNT reserves for $867,000 worth of ARB. These transactions were further followed by Kang depositing the proceeds into Radiant Capital, where he borrowed Circle&#8217;s USD Coin. These details have been revealed through data obtained from Lookonchain, a reliable data resource. Seems like Andrew Kang is using leverage to go long $ARB on @RDNTCapital. Buy $ARB → Deposit $ARB → Borrow $USDC → Buy $ARBhttps://t.co/PQwi0Zj9TT pic.twitter.com/afXjeRtTpv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 Multiple Whales Seize Opportunity As ARB Price Improves In addition to Kang&#8217;s intriguing buying activity, another significant player, known by the address &#8220;0xf59b,&#8221; has also recognized the potential in ARB&#8217;s upward trajectory. This whale made a strategic move by depositing 1.2 million ARB tokens, equivalent to $1.5 million, into the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX. Whale&#8221;0xf59b&#8221; finally waited for the rise of $ARB and deposited 1.2M $ARB ($1.5M) into #OKX 30 minutes ago. He withdrew 1.2M $ARB from #OKX on May 8th, and the buying price may be around $1.2.https://t.co/cJReZfg007 pic.twitter.com/jFwBRtPUpK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 This whale&#8217;s decision to pull the tokens out from OKX on May 8 and potentially purchase them at around the $1.2 mark suggests a deliberate strategy of waiting for a price increase before taking advantage of their holdings. By carefully timing their actions, this entity sought to maximize their potential gains as ARB&#8217;s value climbed. These recent large-scale investments signify a growing optimism surrounding Arbitrum&#8217;s Layer 2 solution, despite the challenges it has faced in the market recently. The renewed interest from both Kang and the whale behind the address &#8220;0xf59b&#8221; reflects a belief in the long-term viability and potential profitability of ARB. Furthermore, these strategic moves by multiple whales indicate a broader sentiment within the crypto market. As the Ethereum network gradually recovers from the recent drop, there is a growing expectation of increased activity on Layer 2 networks. This anticipation sets the stage for a potentially bullish cycle for these networks, including Arbitrum. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.
