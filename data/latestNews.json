He explained that if the judge in the Coinbase case grants the exchange's motion to dismiss, it would indicate that token sales on the exchange are not subject to U.S. securities laws, although the crypto staking aspect remains part of the legal proceedings.</p><p>He explained in a post,</p><blockquote>“The only way Ripple and the SEC (could) settle before the end of the year is if Judge Failla grants the Coinbase motion to dismiss or partially grants it – finding token sales on an exchange in a blind bid/ask transaction do not fall under U.S. securities laws”</blockquote><p>Should the motion to dismiss be approved, the SEC's ability to pursue an appeal would be considerably constrained, making a settlement a logical option.
