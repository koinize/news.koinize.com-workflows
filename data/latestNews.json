As a result, BTC’s price saw its biggest green candle since late August.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/f313c80f-239c-4867-bc18-833492211d1f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD hourly price chart.

In comparison, only about $6 million worth of long positions have been liquidated. A similar liquidation event occurred on Sept. 12–13 and preceded a 5.5% rally — from around $25,830 to over $27,200 — by Sept. 19.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/a1592626-2b14-4df8-a6d1-14dfae3cf842.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Crypto market liquidation heatmap featuring Bitcoin.

Therefore, the combination of new buyers and short liquidations likely boosted the BTC/USD pair even further. </p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>From a technical standpoint, the current BTC price rally risks exhaustion in the short term.</p><p>Notably, BTC’s daily relative strength index (RSI) may hit or close above 70 this week — an “overbought” area indicating an impending period of correction or consolidation afterward.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/056476fe-5ce5-48db-bdd3-bf40edbd6836.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD daily price chart.

That is valid as long as it holds strong above its long-term support, the 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near $25,750.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/79bdffa0-10ed-460c-83b2-3959f4e292b0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD weekly price chart.
