Called “Base Bootcamp,” the new program doesn't cost anything to attend. However, it's designed for “mid to senior level Software Engineering individual contributors” and students <a href=\"https://base.mirror.xyz/AwurHvCNqDPQYIs5aabA3DVyfDlC4rE1WBJdKU28a_g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">must</a> fill out an application and be accepted to enroll. Less than 20 students will be accepted into each “cohort” or class, and the team will stop accepting applications on October 27, the announcement stated.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Introducing Base Bootcamp, an eight-week program designed to turn experienced developers into smart contract developers<br><br>Base Bootcamp will make learning interactive and collaborative, with support from experienced engineers and dedicated mentors<a href=\"https://t.co/gecI1FMpzT\">https://t.co/gecI1FMpzT</a></p>&mdash; Base ️ (@BuildOnBase) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1715429946997498208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 20, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In its announcement, Base claimed  the program is necessary because most software developers still do not know how to build Web3 apps. “Today, there are fewer than 30,000 onchain developers,” they stated, “compared to nearly 30 million software developers.” This implies that only 0.1% of software developers work in Web3.</p><p>The team released an online training program called “Base Camp” earlier in the year, which was open to anyone. But they decided that this wasn’t enough, as “keeping the momentum to learn a complex new skill alone can be difficult.” They claim that Base Bootcamp will provide more support for developers who don’t want to study alone.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-layer-2-network-base-open-source-code\"><strong>Coinbase open sources code for layer-2 network Base</strong></a></em></p><p>The Base Bootcamp will pair each student with a mentor who they will meet with each week. It will also give them access to a group of Coinbase and Base engineers who will be available during office hours to answer questions. A private Discord server will be created to allow students to communicate with each other and to Base engineers, and additional assignments will be given that will be graded by members of the team. At the end of the program, students will be required to create their own Web3 app and present it to other students.</p><p>Although the program does not charge tuition, students are required to put up 1 Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) on deposit to ensure that they finish the program. The team claimed that this deposit will be returned to the student upon graduation.</p><p>The lack of qualified Web3 developers is a commonly reported problem in the industry. Some Australian educators <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/lack-of-qualified-people-without-more-web3-education-say-academics\">have suggested teaching Web3 development in high schools</a> as a means of combating the problem. Other companies have tried to create tools to make Web3 development more simple. For example, Circle recently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-launches-web3-development-platform-web2-developers\">released a set of tools</a> that allow developers to deploy contracts using familiar Web2 methods.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-uncertain-path-analyst-predicts-plunge/",
    "description": "Recent analytical insights from JB, a crypto analyst from the Cheeky Crypto YouTube channel, suggest that Cardano (ADA) one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market might face a plunge before any potential resurgence. Anticipating A Downward Trend According to JB&#8217;s analysis, Cardano is possibly on the brink of a price dip. Following the cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent pullback, which was exacerbated by the unfounded news about a Bitcoin ETF approval, JB predicts ADA&#8217;s price could slide to a range between $0.2296 and $0.2185 before any possible upward reversal. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Getting Ready To Explode: Analyst Presents 16,500% Blowout JB further emphasized the broader crypto market&#8217;s sentiment, referencing the Fear and Greed index, which recently stood at 47 &#8211; a nearly neutral position. Interestingly, as highlighted by JB, this metric diverges from market expectations, as many assumed a more fearful sentiment following the unsubstantiated ETF news. Furthermore, to get a clearer picture of ADA&#8217;s potential trajectory, the analyst touched on fundamental factors concerning Cardano. Within the 24 hours leading to JB&#8217;s analysis, there were 38,256 active ADA addresses on the Cardano blockchain. Of these, 31,330 were receiving addresses, while 27,599 were sending. Moreover, during this period, ADA witnessed 55,893 transactions which accrued fees equivalent to 19,908 ADA or approximately $4,841. Another interesting observation was the addition of 4,086 blocks to the Cardano blockchain, pushing the block height past 9.434 million. When examining ADA&#8217;s holders, JB noted a 0.16% weekly increase in wallets possessing up to 10,000 ADA. This growth expanded to 0.55% over the past month. Conversely, wallets holding over 1,000 ADA experienced a 0.2% increase in the last week and a 0.08% rise over the month. Whales&#8217; Play In Cardano (ADA) Price Movement? Another revelation by the analyst that caught attention was the plummeting number of wallets holding up to 1 million ADA. This segment saw a reduction from 2,789 to 2,773. This could insinuate that ADA whales might be partaking in a sell-off strategy. According to JB, their rationale could be to drive the price downwards, enabling them to repurchase ADA at more favorable rates, and setting the stage for more significant profit margins in the future. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Addresses Continue To Fall, What Does This Mean For ADA Price? Regardless of the analysis, ADA has experienced a notable increase in its price over the past week and has maintained a bullish trend in the last 24 hours, rising by 2.2% to a trading price of $0.251, at the time of writing. In addition, the altcoin&#8217;s trading volume has also appreciated significantly in the past week. Particularly, ADA&#8217;s daily trading volume has surged from below $95,000 recorded this last Friday to as high as above $150,000, in the last 24 hours.
