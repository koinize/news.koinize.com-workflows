    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bitcoin-btc-prepares-for-next-rally-tradecurve-leads-the-altcoin-pump-with-80",
    "description": "<p>It has been a bullish month for Bitcoin (BTC) so far, with the cryptocurrency peaking at $31,486 before settling in the $30k range. But while Bitcoin (BTC) prepares for the next rally, it appears that Tradecurve &mdash; a new cryptocurrency trading platform &mdash; is leading the altcoin pump with 80% gains during the ongoing presale. Let's look at why these two assets are so bullish.</p>\n<p></p>\nTradecurve: More Gains Ahead?\n<p>Tradecurve is shaping up to be a comprehensive trading platform that offers a wide array of investment options &mdash; think stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices &mdash; all under one roof. The aim is to offer a one-stop-shop for users to manage their diverse investment portfolios, irrespective of where they are in the world.</p>\n<p>The beauty of Tradecurve lies in its simplicity. Joining the platform is as easy as providing an email and linking your DeFi wallet. There's no need to go through the usual hoops of identity verification or other cumbersome onboarding procedures, making it a breath of fresh air in the otherwise intrusive investment landscape.</p>\n<p>Beyond just trading, Tradecurve also offers an arsenal of advanced tools designed to amplify your trading experience and potential returns. They offer a subscription to an AI-powered trading tool, for instance, that automates trading strategies and offers in-depth analytics on all markets.</p>\n<p>The TCRV token, the lifeblood of the Tradecurve platform, also unlocks a host of benefits. Holders can stake tokens to earn passive income, avail of VIP account benefits, get discounts on subscription fees, and more as Tradecurve continues to establish itself in the DeFi world.</p>\n<p>At present, the TCRV token is available at a bargain price of $0.018 during the presale. Considering that experts predict the value of the token could skyrocket to $1.00 after its listing on leading exchanges later this year, this presale might just be a golden opportunity to jump on board the Tradecurve bandwagon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nBitcoin (BTC) To $40K?\n<p>Tradecurve isn't the only digital asset in the spotlight &mdash; Bitcoin (BTC) is preparing for its next rally and could hit $40,000 in July. This prediction comes from noted crypto analysts who suggest that an influx of institutional investors could push Bitcoin (BTC) prices to fresh all-time highs.</p>\n<p>This news was triggered by the news that Blackrock, the largest global asset manager in the world, recently filed an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for Bitcoin (BTC). This significant move signals Wall Streets' increasing confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), marking a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency sphere.</p>\n<p>While this news should have long-term impacts, Bitcoin (BTC)'s price has already pushed from $28.4k to a peak of just above $31k within a week. Analysts are watching closely, speculating this news could herald the onset of a new bull market for Bitcoin (BTC).</p>\n<p>You see, approval of the Bitcoin ETF could trigger a substantial flow of capital into the crypto market. ETFs present an opportunity for traditional and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to personally buy, store, and manage the cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>However, they caution that for this upward trajectory to continue, Bitcoin (BTC) will first need to break through the $31-32k resistance level. The current price of $30,600 has the market bullish, with many anticipating a breakout and pump to the $36,000 - $40,000 range within days.</p>\n<p>To find more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token, visit the links below:</p>\n<p>Click Here For the Website</p>\n<p>Click Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens</p>\n<p>Follow Us Twitter</p>\n<p>Join Our Community on Telegram</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/arb/arbitrum-dao-locks-tokens-into-vesting-contract/",
    "description": "Arbitrum DAO recently took a step toward addressing an obstacle. The DAO has committed to locking 700 million ARB tokens, valued at an estimated $770 million, into a vesting contract to foster transparent governance and accountability, per a community proposal.  The approval for this commitment came from an improvement proposal introduced during a contentious period within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The specifics of this commitment involve gradually releasing these funds to the Arbitrum Foundation over four years. Details Of The Vesting Contract The new initiative, aptly termed AIP 1.1, solves recent disagreements concerning Arbitrum&#8217;s internal governance. Earlier this year, the project was embroiled in controversy due to a proposal for a &#8216;special grants&#8217; program. Related Reading: Arbitrum Gains Tempered By Obstacles, Hindering ARB’s Further Upswing This controversial program was originally designed to assign more than 700 million ARB tokens directly to the Arbitrum Foundation. These funds, representing $1 billion at the time, were proposed to be directed toward backing projects utilizing Arbitrum&#8217;s advanced technology. The sheer magnitude of the allocation sparked concerns about the transparency of a project whose ethos is grounded in collective decision-making. This resulted in an alternate proposal to redirect the funds from the Foundation back to the DAO, which was subsequently rejected. To satisfy the concerns of the community, the proposal AIP-1.1 was introduced. This strategic proposal aimed to impose stricter controls on the allocation of the DAO&#8217;s treasury. This plan empowers the DAO with the authority to modify the vesting period, allowing them to lengthen, shorten, or even halt the vesting process entirely. This move towards financial transparency marks a milestone for Arbitrum&#8217;s DAO, reinforcing its commitment to its decentralized and democratic ethos. It not only provides a check on the arbitrary allocation of funds but also ensures that decisions align with the interests of the Arbitrum community. Implications for Arbitrum Securing $770 million in ARB tokens through a vesting contract is a significant event for Arbitrum&#8217;s DAO. By taking this action, the Arbitrum Foundation can establish a consistent source of funding and demonstrate to the community at large their dedication to transparency and accountability. The measure could also impact the market dynamics for the ARB token. With a significant amount of the tokens locked up, the reduced supply could potentially influence its price. This further underscores the importance of this step by the Arbitrum DAO, as its ramifications extend beyond governance to directly influencing the ecosystem&#8217;s dynamics. Related Reading: Arbitrum Airdrop Success: Metrics Soar Higher Across The Board Furthermore, this development within the Arbitrum ecosystem signifies the project&#8217;s maturity and commitment to its democratic ideals. It exemplifies how DAOs can effectively manage significant resources while maintaining transparency and accountability, setting a precedent for other similar organizations in the crypto ecosystem.  Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, Arbitrum&#8217;s native token ARB has witnessed an upward trend of 2.3%. This bullish trend comes after the asset has seen slight retracement in the past week, dropping by nearly 2%. ARB currently has a market price of $1.12 at the time of writing.
