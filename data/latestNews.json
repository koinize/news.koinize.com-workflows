But PayrNet’s license was <a href=\"https://www.lb.lt/en/news/licence-of-uab-payrnet-revoked-for-serious-violations-bankruptcy-proceedings-to-be-initiated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">revoked</a> by Lithuania’s central bank, leading to the risk that users’ funds may become temporarily stuck on their cards.</p><p>An email stated that only funds transferred to a user’s debit card would be affected. Otherwise, “this issue in no way influences your Cryptopay account which shall continue business as usual.”</p><p>As for funds that have already been transferred to a card, Cryptopay recommends that they be spent or transferred away “as soon as possible.” This can be done by using the card to buy crypto, withdrawing it as cash from an ATM, transferring it to a different card or simply spending the money at a store.</p><p>Cryptopay also clarified that even if a customer’s card stops working, the user can still recover the card’s funds from UAB PayrNet directly. Cryptopay offered to help coordinate this process if this becomes necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-pay-africa-south-asia-adoption\"><strong>Binance Pay sees growing interest in Africa, Eurasia and Eastern Europe</strong></a></em></p><p>In an email conversation with Cointelegraph, a Cryptopay representative clarified that the problem primarily affects users in the EU. However, users in the United Kingdom may be temporarily affected because the company has “switched off card services in order to maintain operational stability.” These services should be back up and running within “a couple of days” in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Cryptopay head of support Konstantin Gorin stated that the company has dealt with crises from the banking system in the past, and he believes the company is ready to tackle this present challenge:</p><blockquote>“This October it’s ten years on the market for us, we’ve seen worse. We’ve already been through similar situations in the past (back in 2018 when MasterCard and VISA pulled a plug on almost every existing crypto card programme and back in 2020 when Wirecard scandal hit the market), we're confident that we’ll overcome this and keep on.</blockquote><p>Gorin also claimed that the team is already working on a new debit program, stating, “First order of business to make sure our affected clients are taken care of, next — we’re already working on a new card programme solution for them and for us.\"</p><p>Debit card issuer Wirecard <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/troubled-debit-card-issuer-wirecard-files-for-insolvency\">went bankrupt</a> in June 2020. At the time, it had become one of the most used debit card providers for crypto companies, including Cryptopay. Cryptopay later relaunched its program with a different provider.</p><p>Despite continuing troubles in the crypto debit card industry, there are also signs that debit card companies are becoming more favorable to crypto. In March, Mastercard announced that it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-to-settle-transactions-for-stablecoin-wallet-in-apac\">integrate stablecoins into its payment network</a> within the Asia-Pacific region, allowing them to be accepted in the region wherever Mastercard is.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "The past few days saw excitement among market participants as many cryptocurrencies soared to new highs amid improving sentiments. Stacks (STX) was among the tokens that stood out even when the market appeared gloomy and once again, the bulls achieved an incredible feat in the last 24 hours, pushing the price to a new 60-day high.  Stacks (STX) demonstrated a significantly bullish momentum in seven days, going from $0.5501 to $0.8743, the highest price attained in the last 60 days. With this impressive price movement, a $1 milestone seems imminent. Stacks Defends Its Price Momentum According to CoinMarketCap data, STX has recorded a remarkable price increase of 72.66% in the last seven days, positioning it as the highest gainer on the weekly chart. The token maintains the bullish momentum at the time of writing, with a 24-hour price increase of 12.23%, leaving the current value at $0.8406. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 With this bullish price movement, Stacks’ market cap has increased significantly by 13.45% to $1.172 billion. Stacks also witnessed a massive boost in trading volume in the last seven days. The trading volume went from $32.19 million on June 18 to $450 million on June 21, a nearly 1300% increase.  The massive increase in trading volume demonstrates a surge in investor demand and buying pressure, reflecting the positive sentiment in Stacks markets. Though the volume seems to stall over the past 24 hours, the token still sustains its momentum, reaching over $351 million.  What’s Influencing Stacks’ Price Moves Stacks is a Bitcoin blockchain layer that enables developers to deploy smart contracts, NFTs, DeFi, and dApps on the Bitcoin network. Simply put, Stacks brings DeFi to Bitcoin, unlocking billions in capital and setting the pace to activate a Bitcoin economy. STX, being Stacks&#8217; native token, has been soaring recently due to the increased demand for Ordinals NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dune analytics data shows that Ordinals’ daily inscription spending has increased from $29 million in May to $48 million in June.  This increased network activity is significantly pushing the STX token price higher. Moreover, Bitcoin’s increasing market sentiment following news of BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application must have robbed off on STX. Another factor behind STX’s price action is the increased investor sentiment due to the regulatory approval by the US SEC. Stacks recently became the first SEC-certified token offering in the United States. The legitimacy contributed to boosting STX&#8217;s price by attracting investors&#8217; interest. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi The broader crypto market performance has also contributed to boosting STX price. The global crypto market cap has increased by 3.23%, with most coins adding massive gains in the last day. STX Price Outlook Notably, STX has bounced off all Moving Averages, a strong bullish indicator for more price uptick. STX&#8217;s primary support and resistance levels are $0.74054 and $0.8840, respectively. The token has already conquered the $0.8 resistance and turned it into a support level, indicating higher upticks as the bulls mount pressure to break the resistance level at $0.8840.
