In its report, the Committee said:</p>\n\n<p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Griffith, the UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said it &ldquo;firmly disagrees&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.&rdquo;</p>\nRegulating Crypto as Gambling Would Drive Crypto Offshore\n<p>In its response to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, Griffith stated that such an approach to regulation would defy the globally agreed-upon standards and potentially drive crypto activity offshore.</p>\n<p>The government also opined that such a law would fail to address certain risks associated with crypto trading, such as market manipulation.</p>\nRegulating Crypto in the UK\n<p>The government further stated it is already working on crypto asset regulation, and proposed rules were put before parliament and debated last month. In its response, the government said:</p>\n\n<p>HM Treasury and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will work with the industry to ensure crypto firms are made fully aware of the standards required for approval at the FSMA gateway.</p>\n<p>Further communications will be provided in due course to ensure standards for approval are clearly available to crypto firms operating in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Regulators in the UK have made strides in crypto regulation to address global concerns over the industry&rsquo;s risks.</p>\n<p>The House of Lords recently passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the country.</p>\n<p>Deemed a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for the UK economy,&rdquo; the bill seeks to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo; and will &ldquo;grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
