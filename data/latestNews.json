He stated that MiCA gives the crypto industry a framework to operate with and is expected to bring clarity.</p><p>Anders noted that crypto exchanges eagerly <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-mica-crypto-legislation-added-to-official-journal\">await the full implementation</a> of the MiCA framework, while acknowledging that governments like Sweden are reluctant to issue new licenses for crypto companies. He emphasized that while these governments cannot halt the framework, they can delay its progress. Furthermore, he mentioned the possibility of governments deeming <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-president-reiterates-calls-for-mica-ii-in-response-to-ftx-collapse\">the MiCA framework inadequate</a>, leading to a two-sided power dynamic.</p><p>When asked his opinion on which crypto exchange or theory the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) would come for next, Anders said he thinks Crypto​.com might be the next potential target as they operate in America. Continuing, he said he has a more Swedish perspective and could relate to the recent <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/public/index.php/news/sec-coinbase-binance-lawsuits-surge-defi-trading-volumes/ampc\">SEC clampdown on Binance and Coinbase</a>. Anders said the SEC shares a similar approach with the government in Sweden as the regulatory challenges in Sweden is happening on a smaller scale when compared to the U.S. </p><p>Anders remains optimistic about Bitcoin, dismissing any negative notions. He believes that the efforts of banks and governments to impede cryptocurrency's growth only fuel his enthusiasm. He asserts that Bitcoin's <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">(BTC)</a> superiority becomes evident in comparison to the flaws of the fiat system and the stress caused by inflation.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-mica-crypto-legislation-added-to-official-journal\"><strong><em>EU starts countdown to crypto legislation, adds MiCA to official journal</em></strong></a></p><p>The CEO highlighted the rise of the mining industry with companies like Intel entering and manufacturing mining machines.

However, using the power of Google search operators can substantially increase one’s job search and help land the perfect opportunity.</p><p>By employing Google search operators correctly, one can limit a job search to specific job titles and localities and avoid unwanted phrases. For example, by using the “intitle” operator, you can specify the job title you’re seeking, such as “intitle:IT job.“ Combining it with the “location” operator, like “intitle:IT job location:New York,” further refines the search by focusing on a certain location.</p><p>By stating employment prerequisites and using exact terms within quotation marks, you can further fine-tune your search. For instance, searching for “IT job Java Python” will reveal listings that mention both Java and Python expertise. </p><p>While Google search operators are great tools, remember to explore other job boards and professional networking platforms to widen your search beyond Google’s reach.</p><h2>What are Google search operators?</h2><p>Google search operators are special commands or symbols that can refine and enhance your search results on Google. These operators enable users to set precise criteria, exclude specific terms, search within specific websites and more. Here are some regularly used Google search operators:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"> Google search operators are a game-changer for staying up-to-date with hot topics! Use these commands to find latest info:</p>&mdash; INDRAJEET (@indrajeet877) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/indrajeet877/status/1664525174925037568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<ul><li>Quotation marks: Placing a term within “quotation” marks looks for that precise phrase rather than individual words.</li><li>OR: Using the OR operator between two search phrases allows you to search for either term. For example, “cat OR dog” will give results about either cats or dogs.</li><li>Minus sign (-): Placing a minus sign before a term eliminates that term from the search results. For example, “apple -fruit” will reject pages that have the term “fruit” alongside “apple.“</li><li>Site: By utilizing the “site:” operator, you can search for results within a given website or domain. For example, “site:wikipedia.org artificial intelligence” will display results only from Wikipedia linked to artificial intelligence.</li><li>Intitle: The “intitle:” operator limits search results to pages with the specified term in the page title. For example, “intitle:Python tutorial” will show pages with “Python tutorial” in the title.</li><li>Filetype: Using the “filetype:” operator allows you to search for certain file types. For example, “filetype:pdf web design” will reveal only PDF files relevant to web design.</li><li>Related: The “related:” operator displays websites that are comparable to the provided domain. For example, “related:example.com” will list websites comparable to example.com.</li></ul><p>These are just a few examples of Google search operators that can be combined or used singly to enhance your search and achieve more accurate and tailored results.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-create-an-it-strategy-for-your-business\">How to create an IT strategy for your business</a></em></strong></p><h2>Embrace the power of Google search operators to land your ideal IT job</h2><p>If you’re hoping to land your ideal IT job using Google search operators, here’s how you can focus your search and uncover relevant opportunities:</p><ul><li>Specify the job title and location: Use the “intitle” operator to search for job titles precisely. For example, “intitle:IT job” will only reveal results with “IT job” in the title. Combine it with location using “intitle:IT job location:Glasgow” to filter down results to a certain location.</li><li>Exclude specific terms: Use the “-” operator to exclude certain terms from your search results. For example, search for “IT job -internship” to filter out internship-related listings if you wish to exclude internships.</li><li>Search within specific websites: Use the “site” operator to search within a specific website. For example, “IT job site:linkedin.com” will display IT job ads only from LinkedIn.</li><li>Specify job requirements: Use quotation marks to search for particular phrases. For instance, if you’re seeking employment requiring specific programming languages, search for “IT job Java Python” to locate advertisements that mention both Java and Python abilities.</li><li>Utilize related terms: Include related terms or synonyms in your search to extend the results. For example, instead of looking for an “IT job,\" try “technology job” or “software engineering job” to discover other career names.</li><li>Set up job notifications: Use Google’s “Job Search” feature or job aggregator websites to set up job alerts for specific keywords and areas. This way, you’ll receive email notifications whenever new relevant job ads arise.</li><li>Combine multiple operators: Combine different operators to refine your search further. For example, “IT job site:indeed.com -senior” will display IT job listings on Indeed.com while excluding senior-level positions.</li><li>Utilize advanced search operators: In addition to the fundamental operators, investigate advanced search operators like “AROUND(),” which searches words within a certain proximity to each other. For example, “IT job AROUND(5) Python” will search for IT job postings where “IT” and “job” appear within five words of “Python.”</li><li>Refine your search with wildcard operators: Incorporate wildcard operators like * and ? where * represents any number of characters, and ? represents a single character. This might be beneficial when searching for variations of job titles or specialized phrases. For example, “IT job * engineer” will include results like “IT job software engineer” and “IT job systems engineer.”</li></ul><p>Remember to combine these operators and experiment with other search queries to personalize your findings further. Additionally, try employment boards and professional networking tools to broaden your search beyond Google. Good luck in your job search!</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-10-most-famous-computer-programmers-of-all-time\">Top 10 most famous computer programmers of all time</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
