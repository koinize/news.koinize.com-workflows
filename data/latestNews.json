    "description": "The Maker token, MKR, has managed to break the $1,500 level with a sharp 15% rally as on-chain data shows MKR has seen high address activity recently. Maker Has Outperformed Top Coins With 15% Rally In Past Week While giants like Bitcoin have struggled recently, MKR has proven to be different as the coin has observed an impressive run of bullish momentum. Following the latest leg up in the asset&#8217;s rally, it has surged past the $1,500 level, a feat it hasn&#8217;t replicated since May 2022, almost a year and a half ago now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Long-Term Holders Deposit To Exchanges The below chart shows what the asset&#8217;s recent rally has looked like: The value of the cryptocurrency has sharply gone up in recent days &#124; Source: MKRUSD on TradingView Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Chainlink (LINK) and Curve (CRV) have seen better returns than Maker&#8217;s 15% gains during the past week. Even these two assets haven&#8217;t seen bullish momentum as consistent as MKR in the past month, though, as MKR&#8217;s superb 42% profits in the period notably outshine theirs. Maker Active Addresses Have Hit A 10-Week High According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this sharp run in MKR has come alongside a surge in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s &#8220;active addresses&#8221; metric. This indicator keeps track of the daily total number of unique Maker addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain. This metric&#8217;s value can simply be looked at as the amount of traffic that the network is receiving every day. When the indicator has high values, it means that a large number of users are participating in the trading activity of the asset. Such a trend implies that interest in the coin is high currently. Now, here is a chart that shows how the active addresses metric has changed for MKR during the past month: Looks like the value of the indicator has shot up over the last few days &#124; Source: Santiment no X From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Maker active addresses have climbed up alongside the rally in the asset&#8217;s price. After the latest increase in the indicator, its value has hit 651, which is the highest observed in around 10 weeks. Generally, for any surge to be sustainable, it requires continued participation from a large amount of traders. Rallies that aren&#8217;t accompanied by a sufficient rise in user activity usually run out of steam before long. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Now Most Sustainably-Powered Global Industry: Data Since the latest Maker surge has seen an increasing number of addresses becoming active, signs could be looking good for its sustainability. As the price continues its run, though, some investors might be tempted to harvest the high profits that they have amassed. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the exchange netflow, which shows that some inflows of $7.6 million just have occurred towards centralized exchange platforms, implying that profit-taking may already be beginning. This is a relatively modest amount, but the analytics firm warns that inflows can be something to be cautious about, as they could lead towards at least a temporary top in the price.

    "description": "Could bullish Ethereum news related to the launch of an ETH futures ETF be the catalyst that triggers a massive breakout of a nearly 16-month long ascending triangle pattern? If the pattern is valid, the target is roughly $4,000 per ETH and a revisit to former all-time highs from the last bull market. VanEck Announces ETH Futures ETF Global asset manager VanEck, known best for its ETFs and Mutual Funds, today revealed the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETUF). ETUF will be &#8220;an actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts.&#8221; Related Reading: Bloomberg Analysts Say Ethereum Futures ETFs Could Start Trading Soon – Here’s When Rather than investing in spot ETH, the Fund will trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures, and will be managed by the firm&#8217;s Head of Active Trading, Greg Krenzer. ETUF will trade on CBOE alongside VanEck&#8217;s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF). And although its inception of November 15, 2021 marked the end of the bull market in crypto, the introduction of Ethereum futures has the potential to kickstart the next bull run. Ether's target is $4,000 based on the measure rule &#124; ETHUSD on TradingView.com Ethereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Ascending Triangle Breakout Show me the chart and I&#8217;ll tell you the news, is a famous quote from the late Bernard Baruch. The message reflects the fact that the largest technical moves tend to coincide with a news catalyst and vice-versa. Essentially, the a bullish chart pattern could possibly appear before positive news – such as the launch of an ETH futures ETF – while the news itself is the catalyst for a strong breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond This is precisely what appears to be brewing in ETHUSD charts since June of 2022. Unlike Bitcoin which put in a bottom late in 2022, Ethereum found support about halfway through the year. Since then, Ether has consistently made higher lows, forming a potential ascending triangle chart pattern. Now, the ascending triangle pattern is nearing the two-thirds point from its apex. This increases the chances of a breakout occurring as an Ethereum futures ETF gets launched have increased significantly. All that&#8217;s required is a breakout above $2,000 per ETH on higher than normal volume. Based on the measure rules, reaching the target objective could push prices to over $4,000.
