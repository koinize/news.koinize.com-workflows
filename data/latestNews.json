Before the drop, many traders expected a breakout in volatility that would push the price upward but this was obviously not the case. With the substantial liquidations, it's important to address whether professional traders gained from the price crash.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin just saw one of its largest daily liquidations by volume in history.<br><br>Starting at 4:30 PM yesterday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> fell 7.5% in 20 MINUTES, erasing $42 billion in market cap.<br><br>This mass-liquidation event involved more outflows in 1 day than during the FTX collapse in November… <a href=\"https://t.co/KmVNkXoOLw\">pic.twitter.com/KmVNkXoOLw</a></p>&mdash; The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1692531047110500352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>There's a common belief among cryptocurrency traders that whales and market makers have an edge in predicting significant price shifts and that this allows them to gain the upper hand over retail traders. This notion holds some truth, as advanced quantitative trading software and strategically positioned servers come into play. However, this doesn't make professional traders immune to substantial financial losses when the market gets shaky.</p><p>For larger-sized and professional traders, a majority of their positions may be fully hedged. Comparing these positions with previous trading days allows for estimations on whether recent movements anticipated a widespread correction in the cryptocurrency market.</p><h2> Margin longs at Bitfinex and OKX were relatively high</h2><p>Margin trading lets investors magnify their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the funds to acquire more cryptocurrency. Conversely, traders who borrow Bitcoin employ the coins as collateral for short positions, indicating a bet on price decline.</p><p>Bitfinex margin traders are known for swiftly establishing position contracts of 10,000 BTC or greater, underscoring the involvement of whales and substantial arbitrage desks.</p><p>As depicted in the chart below, the Bitfinex margin long position on August 15 stood at 94,240 BTC, nearing its highest point in four months. This suggests that professional traders were entirely caught off guard by the abrupt BTC price crash.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/977028e9-769f-474c-af78-10cacbce9617.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitfinex margin BTC longs, measured in BTC. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike futures contracts, the equilibrium between margin longs and shorts isn't inherently balanced. A high margin lending ratio signifies a bullish market, while a low ratio suggests a bearish sentiment.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/a1dfc878-9243-4183-873c-50521049813c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>OKX USDT/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX</em></figcaption></figure><p>The chart above shows the OKX BTC margin lending ratio, which approached 35 times in favor of long positions on August 16. More importantly, this level aligned with the preceding seven-day average. This implies that even if external factors skewed the metric previously, it can be deduced that whales and market makers maintained their position on margin markets before the Bitcoin price collapse on Aug. 16 and Aug. 17. This information supports the argument that professional traders were unprepared for any form of negative price movement.</p><h2>Futures long-to-short data proves traders were unprepared </h2><p>The net long-to-short ratio of the top traders excludes external factors that may have exclusively influenced the margin markets. By consolidating positions across perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, a clearer insight can be gained into whether professional traders are leaning towards a bullish or bearish stance.</p><p>Occasional methodological disparities among different exchanges exist, prompting viewers to track changes rather than fixate on absolute values.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/ac60c707-2816-4035-a53b-b3fa7cf34761.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Exchanges’ top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><p>Prior to the release of the Federal Reserve FOMC minutes on August 16, prominent BTC traders on Binance exhibited a long-to-short ratio of 1.37, aligning with the peak levels observed in the previous four days. A similar pattern emerged on OKX, where the long-to-short indicator for Bitcoin's leading traders reached 1.45 moments before the BTC price correction commenced.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-did-bitcoin-price-suddenly-drop-analysts-explain\"><strong><em>Why did Bitcoin drop?

Consequently, a reasonable assumption can be made that professional traders were taken by surprise and did not profit from the price crash.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

In January, this DAO began discussing deploying a second copy of Uniswap to BNB Chain. This opened the question of how Uniswap would be governed on more than one chain since, previously, all votes were taken on the Ethereum network. On Jan. 24, the DAO voted to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-wins-second-temp-check-to-become-bridge-for-uniswap-governance\">deploy a second copy</a> of Uniswap to BNB Chain and to use bridging protocol Celer to send messages from BNB to Ethereum.</p><p>Although this proposal passed, controversy <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-dao-debate-shows-devs-still-struggle-to-secure-cross-chain-bridges\">erupted almost immediately</a> over the choice of Celer bridge as the means of sending messages. Some DAO participants feared that Celer was not secure enough to prevent cross-chain governance attacks. Instead, they recommended Wormhole, LayerZero, or DeBridge be used. Other participants defended Celer as the correct choice.</p><p>On Jan. 31, the DAO <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-wins-second-temp-check-to-become-bridge-for-uniswap-governance\">held a second vote</a> on which bridge should be used for governance. Wormhole won the vote and was chosen as the official bridge for governance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/970ccfa2-3be4-4b8c-bac5-64211afd502c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>UniswapDAO proposal for cross-chain governance. Source: Uniswap.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite this win for Wormhole, the referendum was contentious. Only 62% of UNI tokens were used to cast “yes” votes. By contrast, many UniswapDAO proposals received nearly unanimous votes for or against.</p><p>In the debate leading up to the vote, many participants concluded that Uniswap should use multiple bridges instead of just one. This way, if one bridge became hacked, the other bridges would reject the malicious messages sent by it, and the attack would be prevented. However, no multi-bridge solution was available at the time. Hence, the proposal's supporters argued that Wormhole should be used until a multi-bridge solution could be created.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/token-hoarders-defeat-purpose-of-most-daos-study\"><strong>Token hoarders defeat the purpose of most DAOs: Study</strong></a></em></p><p>In the Aug. 18 announcement from LiFi, Chand said the team’s new bridge aggregator would provide “a future-proof solution for different cross-chain messaging needs,” preventing protocols in the future from needing to rely on a single bridge for governance messages.</p><p>According to the aggregator’s documents, protocols can use LiFi to require that votes be confirmed on two out of three bridges to be valid. For example, if one bridge says that a DAO token holder voted “yes,” but the two other bridges say that they voted “no,” the “yes” vote will be confirmed. The aggregator can also be configured to use three out of five bridges or any other ratio the DAO wants.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/1ae335b4-1b67-40fb-afc1-09cfa00813e3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LiFi bridge aggregator design diagram.

Gnosis <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/gnosis-launches-hashi-bridge-aggregator-to-help-prevent-hacks\">released a similar protocol</a> called “Hashi” in March. </p><p>In June, a UniswapDAO committee <a href=\"https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">claimed</a> that Hashi was “not yet production-ready,” had pending audits and did not have a bug bounty. Therefore, the committee concluded that it was unsuitable to handle DAO governance. </p><p>The LiFi aggregator has also not been audited. Chand claimed in his announcement that “soon, we'll expand its testing and submit it for an audit by Trail of Bits.”</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
