But that's in a very controlled environment. So I think if you were to cut that in half, it would still be very generous and probably will do more than that.”</blockquote><p>Referring to the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/the-blockchain-trilemma-can-it-ever-be-tackled\">blockchain trilemma</a>, which is the delicate balance between decentralization, scalability, and security, he said nothing was sacrificed, adding that the Avalanche developers wrote it from scratch to better handle state management: </p><blockquote>“Basically took out a lot of the stuff that was in the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-an-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-and-how-does-it-work\">EVM</a> (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that they felt was unnecessary on the networking layer, or at the storage layer, and then put our consensus algorithm underneath it. And it just goes fast. Now it's optimized.”</blockquote><p>Blockchains built with HyperSDK will operate as subnets called HyperChains and can be adapted for any function the developer wishes.</p><p>There will be a user interface (GUI) that doesn’t require additional coding and developers will also have a choice of VM. “You can literally launch it in five minutes,” said Mussallem.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kbw-2023-avalanche-partners-japan-loyalty-marketing-company-onboard-100-million-users-web3\"><strong><em>Marketing company wants 90% of Japanese population on Web3: KBW 2023</em></strong></a></p><p>Mussallem said HyperSDK was open source and available right now, “but it's very much in the early beta stages.” </p><p>It hasn't been launched and is not production ready yet as the target for that is by the end of the year, he added. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\">How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
