    "description": "Ethereum price is struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could correct lower if it breaks the $1,865 support zone. Ethereum is currently correcting lower from the $1,920 resistance. The price is trading above $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a short-term drop if there is a break below the $1,865 support. Ethereum Price Struggles Below $1,920 Ethereum’s price extended its increase above the $1,850 resistance zone. ETH even spiked above $1,920 before the bears appeared. A high is formed near $1,929 and the price is now correcting gains, similar to Bitcoin. There was a move below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. However, the bulls are still protecting the $1,865 support zone. A low is formed near $1,866 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,929 high to the $1,866 low. Ether is just trading above $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
