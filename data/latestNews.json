Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><h2>XRP and peers rally after a favorable court ruling </h2><p>Ripple’s longstanding legal battle with numerous courts and investors' lingering concerns over XRP’s utility has long weighed on the altcoin’s price. For at least a year, numerous analysts have speculated that a positive ruling in federal courts would translate to a sharp rally in XRP price, an outcome which was validated on July 13. </p><p>United States District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">granted summary judgment</a> in favor of Ripple Labs on 3 out of 4 issues maintaining that in certain scenarios, the XRP token is not a security. </p><p>The ruling comes nearly 3-years after the lawsuit was filed by the SEC against Ripple on Dec. 22, 2022. An amended complaint from the SEC was subsequently filed on February 18, 2021.</p><p>Interestingly, other tokens which had recently been delisted by major exchanges over concerns that they could be unregistered securities issuances also rallied. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Top gainers on the hour include <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$MATIC</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$SOL</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ADA</a> -- all three were delisted by Robinhood after SEC named them securities in suits against Binance and Coinbase <a href=\"https://t.co/ZiwNGlntVx\">pic.twitter.com/ZiwNGlntVx</a></p>&mdash; Andrew T (@Blockanalia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Blockanalia/status/1679524251357917185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>XRP’s sibling token Stellar (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/stellar-price-index\">XLM</a>), also followed in Ripple’s footsteps, rallying 36.2% at the time of publishing to hit a near 9-month high at $0.13. </p><p>As a result of today’s ruling, a handful of analysts have suggested that the SEC’s loss against Ripple calls into question the viability of its other enforcement actions against crypto-focused companies. Some have even suggested that today’s ruling will hamper the SEC’s multi-year resistance to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase +8% in an hour after XRP declared not a security.
