Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also opposed to exploring the concept of a digital dollar. Both Kennedy Jr. and DeSantis cited privacy concerns as reasons for their positions. The candidates, however, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-invested-up-to-250-000-in-bitcoin-after-miami-conference\">have adopted a crypto-friendly</a> campaign strategy.</p><p> The White House <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-supporter-likely-white-house-next-term-crypto-divide-not-red-v-blue-grayscale\">is likely to be home to a CBDC supporter</a>, according to a recent report from crypto asset manager Grayscale.
