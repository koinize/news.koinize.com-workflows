Chair Jerome Powell suggested that fresh hikes may be necessary in future to tame inflation.</p><p>“As I noted earlier, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year,” he said at a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20230614.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">press conference</a>, referencing the views of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). </p><blockquote>“But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we have moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.”</blockquote><p>Markets thus placed more than a 70% chance of a hike at the next FOMC meeting in July, as per data from CME Group's <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">FedWatch Tool</a> on the day.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/eee53fe1-599e-414e-bf65-a4642133298c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fed target rate probabilities chart.
