The release comes in conjunction with Ledger <a href=\"https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-os\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">finalizing</a> the open-source code for the Ledger Recover on GitHub.</p><p>Provided by blockchain protection platform Coincover, Ledger’s seed phrase recovery solution is a paid subscription service allowing users to backup their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). SRP is a unique list of 24 words that backs up the private keys and gives users access to their crypto assets.</p><p>Ledger Recover was designed for users who “want to add an enhanced layer of resilience” in case their SRP is ever lost or destroyed, Ledger’s chief technology officer Charles Guillemet said. He also emphasized that Ledger Recover is an optional recovery service, adding:</p><blockquote>“If you don’t wish to use the service, no worries — it’ll always be 100% optional. You can simply continue using your Ledger as you did previously — nothing will change.”</blockquote><p>At launch, Ledger Recover is compatible with Ledger Nano X, with Ledger Stax and Ledger Nano S Plus integration coming in the near future. The solution is not compatible with Ledger Nano S, <a href=\"https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9579368109597-Ledger-Recover-FAQs?docs=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the Ledger Recover FAQ.</p><p>Ledger Recover is initially available to passport or identity card holders in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union. “We will be covering more countries and adding support for more documents,” Ledger said.</p><p>The firm emphasized that Ledger Recover’s identity verification “is not the same” as Know Your Customer (KYC) checks carried out by centralized crypto exchanges. Ledger noted that its recovery system only requires a “valid, government-issued document,” stating:</p><blockquote>“Identity verification inherently collects much less information compared to KYC [...] KYC involves ID verification but it can also include revenue information, record of criminal activity, citizenship check, etc.”</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13k0ttl/ledger_recover_pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According</a> to social media posts, Ledger Recovery service will be available at $9.99 per month, or about $120 per year. If a user fails to pay the subscription, the subscription will be suspended, allowing the user to reactivate subscription in the next nine months.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-bitcoin-ledger-ceo-pascal-gauthier\"><strong><em>ETF filings changed the Bitcoin narrative overnight — Ledger CEO</em></strong></a></p><p>“You will need to pay an administration fee of 50 EUR along with any outstanding balance,” Ledger Recover FAQ reads.</p><p>The rollout comes months after <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-recover-paused-code-will-open-source\">Ledger paused the recovery service</a> in May 2023 in response to community backlash.
