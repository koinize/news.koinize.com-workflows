Over the past 24 hours, LINK has witnessed a 3.9% surge in value. Looking at the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has experienced an impressive 22.0% increase in its price. These figures reflect the growing optimism surrounding LINK. Source: Cryptopurview Analyzing the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator, further supports the notion that LINK&#8217;s upward trajectory may continue. The RSI, with readings above 50 and displaying an upward trend, indicates that bulls still maintain the upper hand in the market. Currently, the RSI for LINK is moving upwards and is comfortably positioned above the 50 mark, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Additionally, the indicator has recently crossed into overbought territory, signaling that LINK&#8217;s bullish momentum is robust. LINK demonstrates resilience by maintaining a stronger support level ranging from $10 to $12, as it undergoes a period of consolidation in anticipation of a potential breakthrough from the resistance at $13. This breakthrough may potentially lead to further gains, with a target price of $20.
