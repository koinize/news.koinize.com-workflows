Initially, focusing on 15 cities in 12 countries to establish systems, processes, and legal precedent. The project team will reinvest the funds received to support the ongoing development of custom solutions such as a seamless marketplace checkout and simple developer onboarding processes.&nbsp;</p>Project Lead for DPAT, Mustafa A said: &ldquo;The feedback from our community matters to us, and we have taken that into account. We continue to build applications with the end user in mind and revamping our website and processes to provide an enhanced user experience is a sign of things to come.&rdquo;<p>Beyond the new website built to make it easier to navigate and access project information, the marketplace will help developers smoothly list their projects and engage with their community by offering rewards and equity-based NFTs to swiftly raise capital at prices that are competitive with banks and other traditional lenders. To further show its support to the African real estate industry, DPAT will work closely with agents and developers in project cities to increase knowledge, simplicity and security through implementation and integration of Web3 technology to digitise and update current business models.</p><p>The project is currently in its presale phase and shortly after completion in August, Direct Property Africa will roll out the NFT crowdsourcing marketplace and increase its core team. DPAT will initially launch on Uniswap and list on tier 1 centralized exchanges a few weeks later.

    "description": "<p>Bitcoin is trading over 1% higher on Friday and certain cryptocurrencies have broken trend before the US unemployment figure is released later today.</p>\nWorse jobless figure expected\n<p>With Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell intimating that he is ok with the economy going into recession and &ldquo;things breaking&rdquo;, as long as inflation can be beaten, it does look as if the US is entering a risk off period for quite some time.</p>\n<p>One of the main figures that the Fed looks at before deciding whether the economy needs yet another interest rate hike is the jobless count. The forecast here is for a rise to 3.5% from the previous figure of 3.4%.</p>\n<p>However, even amidst this gloomy period Bitcoin is still looking like it has entered its bull market and current times are perhaps good ones for accumulating ahead of a possible descent into recession next year.</p>\nBitcoin wakes up positive\n<p>Bitcoin woke up this morning in a positive mood and is moving higher again in its sideways range from around $25,800 to $27,670. Current price is at just over $27,000.&nbsp;</p>\nEthereum to steal the show\n<p>Be that as it may, ethereum looks as though it is making its move in order to steal the show from bitcoin. Ethereum has broken the downwards trendline with bitcoin that has been in force since early January this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ethereum dominance has also broken higher and has returned to the levels also seen in early January, but far more importantly these are the same levels from May 21, and even as far back as September 17. A solid and continuous accumulation above this level can potentially see ethereum on route to a flippening of bitcoin.</p>\nAltcoins running\n<p>Many of the altcoins are running strongly right now. Arbitrum, the ethereum layer 2 solution, is up around 8% at time of going to press. Andrew Kang, a large holder, is rumoured to have leveraged his position to buy more.</p>\n<p>Injective Protocol is an altcoin that just runs and runs. It is currently up 10.5% on the day. Ocean, one of the AI-related plays is up 7.4% today having climbed 27.7% just since May 29.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lido, the largest of the liquid staking tokens, another really hot niche, is up 7.3% currently.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
