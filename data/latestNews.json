    "description": "The price of the XDC Network token, XDC, has increased for a total of five consecutive days and is currently trading at its highest level since April 2022. The token climbed more than 40% from its lowest point this month to its highest level. At the time of writing, XDC was priced at 0.049, up a solid 16.6% in the last 24 hours. But it was the token&#8217;s seven-day performance that was most impressive when it soared 50%, dominating the list of the weekend&#8217;s top 100 coin listing at crypto market tracker Coingecko. XDC Network has experienced an improvement of 97.17% so far this year. The price of the token is rising with a chance of trend reversal, recovering from the trendline to hit new peaksÂ while bumping up against resistance at $0.04 and support at $0.03. It is anticipated that strong support will raise prices and establish new demand regions. XDC shows strong price action in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko The coin has gone over the 50-day and 25-day moving averages on the daily chart, which is positive. The market capitalization of XDC Network&#8217;s token is now $683,630,126 following recent price movement. Most importantly, since this price was the highest on June 1st, XDC is clinging to a key resistance level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to an overbought state.

Cryptocurrencies total market cap at $1.16 trillion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com The 2017-founded XDC Network has seen price swings during the course of its existence. It experienced a period of fall after achieving its all-time high of $0.17 during the 2021 bull cycle, before reaching new lows in July 2022. It experienced an upsurge in 2023 and spiked to a high of $0.050 before becoming volatile with sporadic upward and negative swings. XDC is currently challenging the $0.049 level, and an increase of 10% would enable it to test its 2023 highs once more.

Let&#8217;s #BuildonXDC ! ðŸ’ª #Blockchain #XDC https://t.co/XVy7fpGQlt â€” XinFin (@XinFin_Official) July 19, 2023 Meanwhile, XDC network&#8217;s unexpected linear rise, despite its relative obscurity, happened at the same time as Bitcoin briefly fell below $30. The introduction of Chain IDE was a major factor in this rise. This year, XDC could reach a price of $0.05850 if it maintains its upward trend. However, if the market&#8217;s opinion changes, the price might fall below $0.02993. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 With continued improvements, XDC is poised to shatter its existing price of $0.049.
