Gensler declined to comment further on the case, but said the commission is pleased with the court’s decision stating that XRP was a security when sold to institutional investors, but disappointed with the non-security ruling for retail investors and other XRP distributions.

The bill would subject DeFi operations to the same requirements as other financial companies, including centralized crypto trading platforms, casinos, and even pawn shops. The proposal also makes anyone who controls that project liable for the use of the DeFi service by sanctioned persons. The bill also set new requirements for operators of crypto kiosks (or ATMs) to prevent their use in money laundering. Kiosk operators would be required to verify the identities of both counterparties in a transaction.</p><h2 id=\"h-altcoins-bled-as-bitcoin-gained-dominance-in-q2-coingecko\"><strong>Altcoins bled as Bitcoin gained dominance in Q2: CoinGecko</strong></h2><p>The second quarter of the year <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-in-q2-2023-bled-altcoins-coingecko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has been a solid one for Bitcoins performance</a> as its market dominance gained against altcoins, which bled throughout the period, according to CoinGecko’s industry report. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) continued to build their market share over the past months, while Binance Coin (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) suffered double-digit losses over the quarter. DeFi tokens were hit particularly hard during the quarter, with Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK) and Lido (LDO) taking double-digit losses as well.
