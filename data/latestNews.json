As conditions become more severe, the country’s export capacity will also be affected. </p><p>In an interview with local media outlet Laotian Times, an EDL employee <a href=\"https://laotiantimes.com/2023/08/25/laos-suspends-power-supply-to-cryptocurrency-mining-businesses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> that another reason for the suspension of supply for crypto mining projects is their inability to “pay their outstanding balances.” </p><p>On Sept. 11, 2021, the Laotian government approved the public-private pilot to explore crypto mining and trading. The move aims to capitalize on China's crackdown on mining, resulting in industrial-scale miners trying to find a different venue for operations. At the time, six companies had been given permission to conduct mining operations in Laos as part of the program. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/laos-government-reportedly-prioritizes-blockchain-technology-for-digital-transformation\"><strong><em>Laos government reportedly prioritizes blockchain technology for digital transformation</em></strong></a></p><p>In other news, the Sultanate of Oman, a country located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-mining-oman-launches-370-million-crypto-mining-center-report\">launched a $370 million crypto-mining center</a>.
