Its initial focus will be on tokenized deposits, that is, tokenized commercial bank money, for use in transactions with tokenized assets. The first step in the project will be the creation of a sandbox that will research and test:</p><p>The HKMA will also form a wCBDC Architecture Community that will consist of local and multinational banks, “key players,” and the HKMA’s CBDC Expert Group, which was formed in October and consists of 11 academics from a variety of fields and universities in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA will seek participation from other central banks and international organizations.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-project-ensemble-support-tokenization-wcbdc\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
