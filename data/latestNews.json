Wallis clarifies that financial inclusion aims to extend financial services to individuals worldwide, especially those with low incomes and no ties to financial institutions.</p><p>Wallis pinpointed key factors behind financial exclusion, including low incomes and a lack of existing ties with financial institutions, leading to the absence of a credit history. In regions with financial exclusion, banks are often commercial entities driven by shareholder interests, posing challenges in serving individuals with limited resources, as generating profits from such a demographic is difficult.</p><p>Wallis contended that CBDCs provide a cost-effective solution by enabling financial services at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods. CBDCs offer streamlined payment options and chances to establish credit, even without previous ties to financial institutions, he said.</p><p>This enables individuals to build credit histories, acquire borrowing capabilities and stimulate the growth of their businesses.

Despite their disparate functions, there are several instances in which they coincide and enhance one another.</p><p>For instance, NFTs can be used in DApps to signify ownership or access privileges for both real and digital assets. DApps can tokenize unique goods, such as in-game assets, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-crypto-art-and-how-does-it-work\">digital art</a> or real estate, by utilizing NFT standards such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155.</p><p>NFTs are frequently used to represent in-game assets in gaming DApps. These assets are tradeable and buyable on secondary markets, which improves the idea of genuine ownership and compatibility across many virtual worlds or games. </p><p>Moreover, DApps built specifically to create, manage and trade digital valuables have become popular due to the rise of NFTs. Tokenizing their creations allows artists and content creators to produce one-of-a-kind digital assets that consumers can purchase, sell and own. This has given creators new opportunities to interact directly with their audience while providing collectors with a safe and verifiable method of obtaining digital asset ownership.</p><p>The programmable nature of smart contracts reinforces the convergence between DApps and NFTs. Smart contracts can be used by DApps to automate a number of NFT-related tasks, including content licensing, royalty distribution and even the implementation of dynamic features inside the NFT itself. The increased programmability of NFTs in decentralized applications improves their usefulness and functionality.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/types-of-nft\"><strong><em>The different types of NFTs: A beginner’s guide</em></strong></a></p><h2>What are NFT DApps?</h2><p>Blockchain-based applications that integrate <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/nonfungible-tokens-how-to-get-started-using-nfts\">nonfungible tokens</a> are known as NFT DApps. Using such apps, users can create, purchase, sell and trade original digital products, such as artwork, collectibles and in-game items. NFT DApps empower gamers, artists and content creators by utilizing the transparency and security of blockchain technology to transform ownership.</p><p>The importance of NFT DApps lies in providing a decentralized marketplace, fostering peer-to-peer transactions, introducing innovative ownership forms, disrupting established sectors and democratizing access to the global digital economy. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/ed2ba5a8-18fa-4d38-8b34-fc802b2c2101.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Types of NFT DApps</h2><p>NFT DApps encompass a diverse range of platforms, each tailored to different facets of the digital and blockchain landscape. </p><h3>Art and collectibles platforms</h3><p>Artists tokenize their works as NFTs on platforms like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-find-nft-metadata-on-opensea-and-rarible/amp\">OpenSea and Rarible</a>, which act as marketplaces for people to purchase, sell and exchange their original digital assets. As centers of the emerging digital art scene, these platforms enable artists to claim ownership and value within the blockchain ecosystem.</p><h3>Gaming and virtual worlds</h3><p>NFTs are used by DApps such as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-virtual-real-estate-in-decentraland-mana\">Decentraland</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-play-and-earn-in-cryptokitties\">CryptoKitties</a> to represent in-game objects, characters or items. These assets can be bought, sold and traded, creating a thriving virtual economy. The convergence of blockchain technology with gaming has resulted in the development of innovative concepts like play-to-earn, which allows users to earn money by engaging in blockchain-based games.</p><h3>Virtual real estate</h3><p>Platforms for virtual real estate give NFTs a distinctive spin. In addition to developing and making money off of their <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-tokenized-real-estate\">virtual real estate</a>, users can buy, sell and trade virtual land and property. This novel idea has sparked interest in user-owned, decentralized virtual worlds and raised the possibility of a new era in digital property rights.</p><h3>Marketplaces</h3><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/the-nft-marketplace-how-to-buy-and-sell-nonfungible-tokens\">Marketplaces</a> like Foundation and Mintable are an essential part of the NFT ecosystem, which provide artists and producers with the means to mint their NFTs and present them to a worldwide audience. These platforms act as intermediaries, bringing together creators and fans and fostering the general expansion of the NFT industry.</p><h3>Decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT collateral</h3><p>In addition to the creative realm, NFTs have found applications in DeFi. DApps like Aavegotchi and Rarible explore the integration of NFTs as collateral within DeFi protocols. By allowing users to lend or borrow funds depending on the value of their NFT holdings, this innovative use case opens up new possibilities at the nexus of digital ownership and decentralized finance.</p><h2>Steps to create and launch an NFT DApp</h2><p>Creating an NFT DApp involves a series of steps, as explained below:</p><h3>Define the concept</h3><p>It is imperative that the team thoroughly establish the NFT DApp’s concept before beginning development. This entails describing the goal, intended user base and distinctive characteristics that will make the DApp stand out in the crowded NFT market.</p><h3>Choose the blockchain</h3><p>For developing an NFT DApp, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-the-popular-blockchains-used-in-nft-development\">choosing the right blockchain platform</a> is a prerequisite. With its well-established infrastructure and broad support for NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155, Ethereum is a well-liked choice. Alternatively, other blockchain platforms, such as BNB Smart Chain, may be considered based on specific project requirements.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/6f35bd53-2412-407c-baf6-4fac7a88401f.png\"  /></figure><h3>Set up the development environment</h3><p>Install the required dependencies and tools to set up the development environment. This covers smart contract development kits, blockchain development frameworks and any additional tools needed for testing and scripting.</p><h3>Develop smart contracts</h3><p>Create the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements\">smart contracts</a> that will govern the distribution, creation and ownership of NFTs. The terms and features of the NFTs, including minting, purchasing, selling and transferring, are outlined in these contracts.</p><h3>Integrate a wallet</h3><p>Integrate wallets to allow users to safely handle their NFTs. To enable users to engage with the DApp via their cryptocurrency wallets, this entails connecting with wallets like <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet\">MetaMask</a> or <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-the-trust-wallet-and-how-do-you-use-it\">Trust Wallet</a>.</p><h3>Implement minting functionality</h3><p>Develop the minting feature so that creators can <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-to-create-an-nft\">tokenize their assets with NFTs</a>. Developers need to design an intuitive user interface (UI) for creators and artists to easily upload their work, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-find-your-nft-s-metadata\">add metadata</a>, and mint NFTs on the blockchain. This ensures a user-friendly platform navigation experience.</p><p>Additionally, implement features for purchasing, selling and trading NFTs if the NFT DApp includes a marketplace. Incorporate features such as auctioning, bidding and real-time pricing adjustments.</p><p>Users should be able to browse, purchase and sell NFTs with ease due to a user-friendly, entertaining UI. Consider adding functions such as filters, search and an easy-to-use wallet interface.</p><h3>Test thoroughly and deploy the NFT DApp to the blockchain</h3><p>Before deploying the NFT DApp to the blockchain, ensure the NFT DApp is thoroughly tested to find and fix any flaws or vulnerabilities. When satisfied, deploy the related files and smart contracts on the selected blockchain. This entails engaging with the blockchain network to enable global user accessibility for the NFT DApp.</p><h3>Launch and marketing</h3><p>A strategic strategy is needed when launching an NFT DApp to spark interest and ensure a smooth launch into the market. Start by releasing well-crafted smart contracts over the mainnet to officially launch the NFT DApp. Plan a thorough <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-pricing-strategy-how-to-price-your-nfts\">marketing strategy</a> at the same time to increase exposure.</p><p>Create a captivating story that highlights the special value proposition of the NFT DApp and share it via a variety of platforms, such as forums, social media sites and cryptocurrency communities. To grow your audience and establish credibility, get in touch with influential people and thought leaders in the NFT industry.</p><p>Establish a well-thought-out website that functions as a central information center and has guidelines and user-friendly interfaces to help new users get the hang of the platform. During the launch phase, it is imperative to implement a robust community feedback loop to resolve user complaints swiftly and promote a pleasant community climate. </p><p>Following the launch, the team must implement an open line of communication with users, respond to their issues, and modify the DApp to adjust to changing market dynamics. </p><h2>Challenges to creating and launching a NFT DApp</h2><p>Developing and launching an NFT DApp present <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/nft-investment-a-beginners-guide-to-the-risks-and-returns-of-nfts\">myriad challenges</a>. The main obstacle is technical scalability because of the growing demand and complexity of NFT transactions. It becomes imperative to ensure a smooth and effective user experience, necessitating creative solutions to deal with possible network congestion and sluggish transaction processing times. </p><p>Security for smart contracts is crucial since flaws might have permanent effects on users and NFTs’ integrity. In addition, it can be difficult to stand out in a saturated market where several NFT DApps are competing for users’ attention.</p><p>Another level of complexity is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-on-the-legal-risks-and-issues-around-nfts\">navigating legal ambiguities</a>, particularly when it comes to intellectual property rights and regulatory compliance. To overcome these challenges, a careful fusion of technological know-how, security protocols, user-centered design and an acute <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-arent-dead-just-resting\">awareness</a> of the changing regulatory environment around NFTs is required.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

Chief technology officer Mira Murati is now serving as interim CEO. According to a blog post, the board of directors engaged in a deliberative review process, which resulted in the conclusion that Altman was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.

We are investigating alongside several partners and will be transparent with what we discover.\"</blockquote><p>According to Juliano, the v3 insurance fund still holds $13.5 million, and users' funds were not affected by the incident. \"Even though no user funds were affected, we will also be conducting a thorough review of our risk parameters and making appropriate changes to both v3 and potentially the dYdX Chain software if necessary,” he noted on X.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/0f1a132c-0900-4c07-9d88-7fc08a2f3470.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Balance changes on dYdX's insurance wallet.

This demand, along with a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/understanding-crypto-custody-what-different-solutions-entail-for-investors-and-businesses\">growing awareness of self-custody</a>, is driving the expansion of the hardware wallet market, which is <a href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet-market-A15162\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-amp=\"https://www-alliedmarketresearch-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet-market/amp\">expected</a> to reach 3.6 billion by 2031.</p><p>However, hardware wallet manufacturers need to overcome several challenges to compete effectively with software-based Web3 wallets.

Additionally, like any physical wallet, hardware wallets are vulnerable to real-world security risks such as theft or structural damage — just like any physical wallet.</p><p>However, a well-designed hardware wallet can improve security without compromising accessibility. This is where <a href=\"https://www.ngrave.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NGRAVE</a>, a digital asset security provider, steps in. The team believes that achieving air-gapped protection for cryptocurrency storage necessitates 100% offline usability, which hardware wallets and anti-tampering measures can provide. This means not having any connectivity like Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi or even USB to completely eliminate any hack or malware attempts.</p><p>NGRAVE applied this approach to its flagship product, the <a href=\"https://www.ngrave.io/en/zero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NGRAVE ZERO</a> hardware wallet. As a fully offline wallet, ZERO only communicates with the outside world through verifiable QR codes.

    "description": "Recent data analysis reveals a significant decline in the performance of YFI, the native token of the Yearn Finance platform. In a dramatic overnight development, the native token of the Yearn Finance ecosystem witnessed a staggering 40% plunge. This downturn in YFI&#8217;s performance prompts a closer examination of the intricate dynamics within the decentralized financial landscape. The abrupt and substantial drop has ignited a wave of speculation within the community, with some expressing concerns about the possibility of an exit scam. Much of its recent profits was wiped by the slump. Investors quickly sold off their holdings in YFI in response to the wider selloff that had shook the cryptocurrency market as a whole, which caused a sudden shift in value.

Specifically, YFI plummeted from $15,450 to $8,950 within a mere 24-hour period. This sharp and rapid descent represents a substantial loss of $6,510 in the value of YFI. The price of YFI has seen a noteworthy rising trend during the last seven days. The asset was trading at almost $9,000 just a week ago. But it quickly gained momentum and by Friday, it had reached its highest price point in more than a year—above the $15,000 level.

The market cap plummeted from $525 million to $275 million. It is once again seeing an upward trend; however, investor sentiment has been negatively impacted by the abrupt decline. The recent sell-off has incited a weekend characterized by fear, uncertaintly and doubt (FUD) among members of the cryptocurrency community. According to certain users on X (formerly known as Twitter), there are assertions made regarding the distribution of the token supply, suggesting that 50% of the tokens were held within 10 wallets under the supervision of engineers.

    "description": "Dogecoin is definitely on a rally as shown by crypto market numbers. The cryptocurrency has experienced a significant market increase amidst a wider consolidation, with the price up by 7.46% in the past seven days.  Although the price of DOGE was recently pushed back down today by some level of resistance near $0.087, it has since bounced back up again at $0.082. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.084, an increase of 2.4% from this support level. This indicates that the bulls are not ready to give up buying momentum.  According to a recent post by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media, DOGE has finally confirmed a break out of a descending channel pattern. On-chain signals also point to a huge surge in interest and trading volume, indicating DOGE might be going higher soon. $DOGE has confirmed a breakout from its Channel#DOGE #Crypto #Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/SvmtG65FZa — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) November 17, 2023 Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Race: BlackRock Wants An Ether Spot ETF Metrics Signal Impending Breakout The current state of the cryptocurrency market appears to be one of general consolidation when viewed through the lens of the price action of the many different cryptocurrencies that are tracked by Coinmarketcap.  Crypto market caps seem to be running out of steam after a four-week consecutive rally. However, Dogecoin&#8217;s market value has been increasing over the past week, bucking the trend of most other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market size, which has all shown a decline in their market caps over the past week.  Source: IntoTheBlock Dogecoin has finally broken out of its narrow trading range in the weekly candle chart, surging over 45% in the past month. Several catalysts have contributed to this impending breakout, one of which is an increased trading activity. Another catalyst is the announcement of Astrobotic’s plan to send a physical Dogecoin token to the moon in December. Whale movements have also contributed for the most part. According to on-chain data from crypto analytics platform Santiment, the cumulative balance of wallets holding 10 million to 1 billion DOGE has increased from 44.63 billion DOGE tokens on November 1 to a cumulative balance of 47.38 billion DOGE tokens on November 17th. As a result, these large holders have increased their holdings by 2.75 billion DOGE, worth approximately $231 million at the crypto&#8217;s current price. Source: IntoTheBlock How High Can The Dogecoin Price Go? The technical indicators for Dogecoin are looking quite bullish right now. The short 10-day Moving Average has climbed steadily above the longer 21-day Moving Average since a bullish cross on October 23 last month, indicating the bulls still have major control over the market. A continued bullish momentum could see the crypto break various price resistances, the first being the $0.87 level.

    "description": "The altcoins market has been on a tear over the past few weeks, thanks to the resurgence of the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and the shifting climate of the general crypto market. Although the recent momentum of the altcoin market seems to be waning, there is still broad optimism amongst many investors and analysts. Mags, a popular crypto analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, has offered insight into the current landscape of the crypto assets class and its future prospects as the bull market seemingly approaches. Altcoins To Go Parabolic Again? In a post on X, Mags put forward a bold forecast for the altcoins market capitalization and expects the value of most cryptocurrencies to go parabolic in the coming years. The crypto analyst’s bullish argument revolves around the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe of the altcoin chart. On the highlighted chart, the monthly MACD is on the verge of making a bullish cross.  Related Reading: Cardano Falling Wedge Pattern: Analyst Predicts 100% Increase Following Breakout From a historical standpoint, the crypto analyst cited that a similar bullish cross occurred on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator in 2020. Following this cross, the altcoins market cap skyrocketed by more than 2,000% from $85 billion to $1.73 trillion. If this MACD cross forms again, Mags expects a similar bull run for the altcoins market. In what seemed like a more realistic stance, the crypto analyst postulated a surge to a $7 trillion market cap by 2025, even if the altcoins experience only half of the 2020 growth. This represents a roughly 1,000% rally from the current altcoin market cap of $637 billion. According to data provided by CoinGecko, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $1.429 trillion, with Bitcoin maintaining its place as the largest cryptocurrency (market cap of more than 700 billion). Bitcoin Reclaims Dominance In Crypto Market According to a recent report by Santiment, Bitcoin seems to be back to dominating the altcoins after a good run in the past month. The on-chain analytics platform highlighted that most cryptocurrencies have been witnessing a price correction at the tail end of the week. 📊 #Bitcoin price dominance is finally back, at least for the time being. #Altcoins have been retracing on the tail end of the week after the past month&#8217;s blistering hot rally.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/failed-bearish-signal-could-send-bitcoin-to-85k-next-month/",
    "description": "Bitcoin recently gave a bearish signal, which ultimately failed to produce a meaningful pullback. Due to the technical failure, historical data suggests that in only a matter of a month BTCUSD could set a new all-time high and reach a target of $85K per coin. Here’s why. Why Failed Bearish Technicals Produce Bullish Breakouts In technical analysis, certain patterns are considered characteristically bearish or bullish. For example, the ascending triangle is a typically bullish-leaning pattern, but only breaks upward 63% of the time. The other 37%, the pattern breaks down bearish. Because of the nature of how orders and stop losses are stacked on either side of a pattern’s trend lines, a failed bullish pattern can be extremely bearish and vice-versa. Dissecting further, since the pattern was visibly bullish, it could have attracted more long-side positioning that is forced to unwind lower. Related Reading: Technical Analysis For Beginners: Learn How To Chart Crypto Recently, Bitcoin price gave a bearish TD9 sell setup on the weekly TD Sequential. However, no major correction followed. When this occurs, it often results in a sizable move in the opposite direction of the signal. More simply put, the failed TD9 sell setup could mean a massive move higher. And how high price could go and how fast might shock you. Could BTC reach $85K in four weeks? &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Market Timing Tool Hints At Bitcoin Rally To $85K The TD Sequential is a market timing indicator developed by Thomas Demark. A TD9 setup or TD13 countdown is a specific sequence of candles that signal trend exhaustion. Back in 2020 when this same signal failed, Bitcoin blasted off to new all-time highs above $20,000 and then some. It rallied 143% in the four weeks following the signal and over 300% more in total when it was all said and done. Related Reading: Select This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish If the same magnitude move followed this recently failed TD9 sell setup, Bitcoin price would reach $85,000 by the end of December. Another 300% beyond the current all-time high in BTCUSD would take the top cryptocurrency to over $200,000 per coin in total. In terms of lower prices, the indicator also provides TDST support and resistance levels. These levels rise and fall with each completed TD setup. This latest setup caused TDST floor price support to raise from $10,000 to $25,000, reducing the chances that BTCUSD ever trades below that price again. In December 2020, after a failed TD9 sell setup, #Bitcoin did another 143% in 4 weekly candles, pushing above former ATH resistance The same magnitude move would bring $BTC to another new ATH at $85,000 before the end of the year Still doubt my thesis we&#8217;ll see ATHs in 2023? pic.twitter.com/GwCXEaY1II — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) November 17, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

    "description": "Amid the ongoing Ethereum scandal, former Ethereum advisor and attorney Steven Nerayoff has recently revealed how he plans on sharing proof of Ethereum founders&#8217; fraud activities in the early days of the cryptocurrency asset. Ethereum Founders&#8217; Fraudulent Acts To Be In Lawsuit Following an X (formerly Twitter) post by a user Heidi from Crytotips, the crypto enthusiast was seen trying to underscore the lack of authenticity from Nerayoff&#8217;s claims. According to her, his accusations were a no-brainer due to the disclosure lacking proof of his accusations. Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge However, Nerayoff in response to the video, asserted that he never claimed his accusations were going to be in the disclosure highlighting the crypto enthusiast&#8217;s lack of proper research. He further added that he is going to reveal the fraudulent acts of the founders in his lawsuit. Nerayoff had always noted that his recording was not actually linked to his accusations but rather his involvement with Vitalik Buterin. “The recording isn’t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was happening &#38; show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,” Nerayoff stated. Furthermore, the crypto expert also pointed out Nerayoff&#8217;s accusations towards federal agencies. According to her, the former advisor was a little paranoid with his accusations. During an X space, Nerayoff accused some high federal agencies of fabricating evidence against him in order to take him out. These include the SEC, FBI, and the DOJ. Total crypto market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Nonetheless, in response to that, Nerayoff has asserted that this was actually proven and publicly filed. &#8220;The paranoia about the agencies? Well, that’s actually proven &#38; publicly filed,&#8221; Nerayoff stated. Crypto Asset Is Not Decentralized From The Onset It appears Nerayoff&#8217;s claims about ETH not being decentralized from the early days are authentic. The post also saw the crypto enthusiast pointing out Nerayoff&#8217;s claims of ETH not being decentralized from the beginning. According to her, cryptocurrencies are not expected to be decentralized from the start and only the core team members know about a crypto asset from the start. If the expert is right then this basically means Will Hinman&#8217;s speech in 2017, about the asset being decentralized from the start was inaccurate.  During the early days of the asset, Hinman asserted the decentralized nature of ETH, when it was considered as a security by the SEC. According to him, ETH was too decentralized to be considered a security. Related Reading: Crypto Acceptance Grows As Fidelity Joins Race For A Spot Ethereum ETF So far, both founders still have not responded to Nerayoff&#8217;s accusations. Nerayoff believes that their silence is due to the evidence he has against them. “Vitalik &#38; Lubin are vicious if they have leverage. Lubin said to me in July 2018 about a network “It’s a centralized piece of sh*t” right after the Hinman speech! They stay silent because I’ll drop more receipts,” Nerayoff stated.

    "description": "XRP is one of the few cryptos with impressive price action this year. The cryptocurrency has been in the public eye for the past few months, as traders wait eagerly for XRP to embark on a major bull run ultimately. However, the crypto has been down for the past few days amidst ongoing market consolidation. Price action shows that XRP is down by 9% in a 7-day timeframe and is currently trading at $0.59.  A recent price prediction made by the cryptocurrency exchange Changelly suggests that the value of XRP could skyrocket to the moon very soon. Its new price forecast says it could surge over 1,700 times its current value over this decade. This would cause the price of one unit of the token to increase from its current level of approximately $0.60 to more than $11 by 2030. Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge Changelly’s Very Bullish Prediction XRP’s growth has mostly been deterred since 2020 by the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit with Ripple, the technology company tied to the crypto asset. The situation changed recently in July 2023, and XRP is now in a position to step out of the shadow cast by this lawsuit. Although XRP&#8217;s price chart has rebounded at a resistance at the $0.70 level and looks like is going to end today with a red bearish candle, general sentiment still remains bullish in the long term. According to Changelly&#8217;s XRP price prediction, the crypto points to a 63 greed on the XRP Fear-Greed Index. As a result, the exchange puts the monthly closing price at $0.8032, a 33.87% increase from its current price.  The optimistic outlook of the crypto exchange extends well beyond the scope of the current year&#8217;s forecast. Changelly predicted that XRP could break above its current all-time high of $3.84 by 2027.  Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Assuming the trend of price appreciation continues, XRP may surpass the $10 threshold by 2030, registering an average and maximum price of $9.71 and $11.37 respectively. This represents a staggering 1,790% increase from its current price. Additionally, the company also projects XRP reaching an average price of $19.91 in the two years after and a maximum price of $23.46 by 2032. How Feasible Is This Projection? As of right now, XRP is the only crypto with a clear regulatory status in the US. Changelly&#8217;s price prediction is obviously very bullish, but it resonates with the larger sentiment among crypto traders and analysts.   In the short term, most analysts expect XRP price to remain volatile but trade within the $0.6 to $1 range for the remainder of 2023. Very bullish predictions have come for a larger timeframe. Analyst ERGAG CRYPTO has set various targets for XRP&#8217;s price, ranging from $5 to $27. From a technical perspective, XRP&#8217;s price just entered a Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) ranging zone, presenting an opportunity for buying more xRP.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/kaspa-binance-listing-sparks-frenzy/",
    "description": "Kaspa, a relatively recent entrant to the cryptocurrency market, has emerged as one of the top performers this weekend, experiencing a remarkable surge in value. This surge aligns with a broader trend, as the entire market capitalization of the crypto market has grown by over 5%, underscoring a substantial increase in overall value. In the past week alone, Kaspa&#8217;s price has soared significantly, contributing to its standout performance in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. The value of Kaspa (KAS) surged last week after it was added to the Coinbase Global platform, hitting a record high. This is frequently linked to the &#8220;Coinbase effect,&#8221; which gives the listed commodity a sense of legitimacy. Related Reading: Crypto Acceptance Grows As Fidelity Joins Race For A Spot Ethereum ETF Also, following the announcement of possible expansion in the Bitcoin cloud mining phenomenon, the altcoin saw a sharp increase. In the next days, there will also be updates on KAS&#8217;s integration with the OKX wallet and a $1 million airdrop. The sentiment gained steam when one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance, declared that it would launch Kaspa for perpetual trading, Friday, drawing interest from investors. The token&#8217;s price climbed by 15% in just one day as a result of this statement, while trading volume increased by 80% between Thursday and Friday. With better order execution and lively buyer-seller interaction, the increased activity indicates that the market is reacting favorably to the listing. Source: Coingecko At the time of writing, KAS was trading at $0.135, up nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, and commanding a solid 55% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto price aggregator Coingecko shows. KAS market cap currently at $2.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As November commenced, there was a notable positive turn of events as the price successfully breached the upper boundary, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Subsequently, the Kaspa coin witnessed substantial price movement, attaining a fresh annual peak. However, it encountered resistance and was turned away at the $0.09732 mark, leading to a correction with a decline exceeding 10% in value. KAS seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Despite this setback, Kaspa&#8217;s price regained traction, surpassing resistance levels and steadily appreciating. In more recent developments, the price confronted rejection at $0.137, setting the stage for an imminent retest of this level, the outcome of which remains uncertain. Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge On average, the price of a newly listed coin on the Coinbase exchange tends to increase by over 80% within the first five days of its listing. Notably, Kaspa has had a growth of more than 60% since reaching a low of $0.0800 on November 13. The act of becoming publicly listed on the top cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume is indicative of establishing credibility and authenticity. Even while metrics like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate that Kaspa might be overbought, upside is still possible. Long-term investors may have an opportunity if KAS can break above $0.140 and achieve a new range high of $0.148, according to market observers.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/worldcoin-wld-crashes-by-11-as-openai-pushes-out-sam-altman/",
    "description": "Worldcoin (WLD) experienced a sharp decline in its market price on Saturday after its founder, Sam Altman, was removed as the CEO of popular artificial intelligence company OpenAI. This development follows the heavy regulatory scrutiny on the crypto project due to privacy concerns. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? OpenAI Votes Out Sam Altman, Cites Loss Of Confidence In a shocking development on Friday, OpenAI announced a leadership change, stating that Sam Altman will immediately exit the company as its CEO.  In this statement, the company expressed its gratitude to Altman for contributing immensely to their development during his four-year tenure as their global leader.  However, after an intense review process by the board of directors, it was concluded that the Worldcoin founder had not been fully honest in his exchanges with the board, leading to a loss of confidence in his ability to continue his duties as CEO. Following Altman’s departure, Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, will now act as interim CEO pending the appointment of a permanent successor. However, as one could expect, Altman’s removal as OpenAI CEO, combined with the scathing statements in the company’s announcement, has created a negative sentiment around the Worldcoin project.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, WLD is currently down by 12.75% over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has managed to remain afloat with a 15.13% gain. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits What Next For Worldcoin?  Worldcoin was officially launched in July with the goal of creating the largest digital identity and financial network. The project relies on the use of iris-scanning orbs to physically admit new members, prompting concerns about privacy, anonymity, and user data protection. After Altman’s departure from OpenAI, there are currently speculations on Worldcoin’s future trajectory. Clearly, Worldcoin benefited from Altman’s visibility as OpenAI’s CEO, as reflected in the token’s current downtrend. Notably, WLD gained by over 25% in October, with many analysts citing anticipation of the OpenAI developer conference in November as the driving force.  Therefore, the removal of Altman from OpenAI may not bode well for Worldcoin in terms of credibility and public investor sentiments. On the other hand, Worldcoin could soon recover from its market slump and rise to higher heights despite this new challenge.  Following its public official launch in July, Worldcoin came under much criticism from global regulators who expressed concerns over operations in regard to the collection of data using iris scanning orbs and the potential applications of user data.  Notably, Worldcoin has been suspended from Kenya, while the governments of the United Kingdom and Germany have opened investigations into the project’s operation.  However, the crypto project has remained resilient despite these regulatory hurdles, marking a milestone of 4 million app downloads and 1 million monthly active users, as reported earlier in November. At the time of writing, WLD trades at $1.85, with a 0.86% decline in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s market cap stands valued at $211.37 million.

    "description": "Fidelity, a prominent asset management firm with over $4.5 trillion in assets under management, has formally submitted an application for the establishment of a Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The decision is a response to the recent action taken by BlackRock, an asset management company, which submitted their application for an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) last week. Fidelity Is 7th On The List Fidelity Investments has recently positioned itself as the seventh asset management in the United States to pursue the aforementioned product. Based on the SEC&#8217;s Form 19b-4 filing, the Fidelity Ethereum ETF is called the &#8220;Fidelity Ethereum Fund&#8221; and is designed to track the performance of Ethereum. If approved, the ETF will trade in accordance with the BZX Rule, the company disclosed.

ETH held by the New York Department of Financial Services on behalf of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund will make up the Trust&#8217;s assets. The Importance Of Spot ETFs Spot ETFs play a pivotal role in significantly expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies to the average investor, aligning with the increasingly emphasized goal of asset managers such as BlackRock, Grayscale, and other industry players. Despite the concerted efforts of regulatory bodies like the SEC to counteract this trend, the push for democratizing access to crypto investments has remained steadfast. ETH market cap currently at $232 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com At the forefront of the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum stand as two of the most prominent digital assets, commanding substantial trade volumes and market values. Drawing a parallel with Bitcoin, Ethereum stands poised for a potentially significant surge in value within the next 24 hours, driven by the announcement of Fidelity&#8217;s application, marking a development that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. ETH Up 6.2% In The Weekly Chart At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $$1,930, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a decent 6.2% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Meanwhile, citing a section of the court ruling in the legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC, Fidelity Investments is optimistic that it will receive permission.

Related Reading: Litecoin Sustains 4-Month Run With 37% Gain, Beating Most Of Its Peers – Details As a result, the court ordered a review of the SEC&#8217;s ruling, and current information suggests that the SEC and Grayscale are still in talks over the suggested product. Emerging Prominence Of Crypto Assets Fidelity has expressed its admiration for Ethereum in a vocal manner. In a recent discussion, Chris Kuiper, the Director of Research at the firm, examined the emerging prominence of digital assets and projected their potential for further expansion in the foreseeable future. The company&#8217;s hope that ETH would be used for large-scale transactions in the future is further expressed in Fidelity&#8217;s Spot Ethereum ETF application.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/bullish-sentiment-surrounds-avax-price-as-republic-adopts-avalanche-blockchain/",
    "description": "Tech firm Republic has recently announced its mission to democratize private market investing, with the selection of Avalanche as the platform for launching its profit-sharing digital asset, the Republic Note (R/Note). The R/Note is a revenue-sharing digital security that is backed by Republic&#8217;s private equity portfolio, which includes over 750 assets. Republic And Avalanche Forge Partnership According to Republic’s announcement, Avalanche was chosen for several key reasons. Firstly, its scalability and speed ensure that Republic Note holders can enjoy seamless and cost-effective transactions.  Notably, Avalanche has established partnerships with renowned brands like Amazon Web Services and Mastercard, highlighting its technical capabilities. Additionally, Republic plans to launch a dedicated Subnet on Avalanche next year, offering a purpose-built network specifically designed for the Republic Note.  This will provide enhanced security, privacy, and regulatory compliance, creating a robust digital security environment. Related Reading: Is $40,000 Next? Unpacking 4 Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Emerging Rally Mission alignment between Republic and Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche, is another crucial factor. Per the announcement, both entities share a commitment to fostering a more inclusive future for financial markets through tokenization. Furthermore, Avalanche&#8217;s “eco-friendliness” sets it apart from other blockchains, consuming significantly less energy, per the announcement.  The pre-sale of Republic Notes has already attracted participation from thousands of individual retail investors, resulting in pre-sales exceeding $30 million. The public listing of the Republic Note is scheduled for December.  Optimism For AVAX Price The partnership between Republic and Ava Labs is anticipated to have a positive impact on the AVAX price. The launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche&#8217;s platform establishes a strong foundation for expanding its reach to a global audience of investors.  Despite a 5% decline in the past 24 hours, AVAX has outperformed major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with a 130% rally over the past 30 days, positioning itself as one of the industry&#8217;s top performers. However, it is important to note that AVAX has recently undergone a correction, and its ability to surpass the $20.64 level will be crucial in determining its prospects amidst the ongoing bullish momentum. Resistance levels at $21.59 and $22.74 have proven challenging for AVAX to breach and consolidate since February 2023. Related Reading: Cardano Breakout Of Epic Proportions: Analyst Predicts 1600% Rally To $6.5 Overall, the forthcoming launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche&#8217;s mainnet is a significant milestone in making the asset accessible to pre-sale participants who have contributed over $30 million.  It remains to be seen whether this partnership can further bolster AVAX&#8217;s price and reinforce the positive trend observed over the past 30 days, potentially driving AVAX to new yearly highs in 2023. The collaboration between Republic and Ava Labs underscores their shared vision of democratizing access to private markets through tokenization.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
