The abuse of power charges, dating from 2017 to 2021, stem from providing financial and electricity subsidies to Jiumu Group Genesis Technology, a firm based in the City of Fuzhou that at one point operated more than 160,000 Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) mining machines.</p><p>Prosecutors say that Yi \"covered up\" the mining operation by instructing relevant departments to fabricate statistical reports and adjust the classification of electricity consumption. From 2017 to 2020, Jiumu's electricity consumption accounted for 10% of Fuzhou's total electricity consumption. \"Yi pleaded guilty and repented, actively returned the stolen funds, and all the bribes and their profits have been seized,\" wrote the ruling magistrate of the Hangzhou People's Court.</p><p>Currently, China bans all forms of cryptocurrency transactions, exchange operations, and fiat-to-crypto onboarding but has stopped short of prohibiting outright ownership. In an Aug. 3 decision, a Chinese court ruled that a $10 million Bitcoin lending contract was invalid based on the country's Bitcoin ban with no possibility of legal debt recovery. On Aug. 14, a Chinese national <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinas-risky-bitcoin-court-decision-is-huobi-in-trouble-or-not-asia-express/\">was sentenced</a> to nine months in prison for helping an acquaintance purchase Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>), profiting $20 <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-man-sentenced-9-months-prison-buying-13-thousand-in-tether-usdt\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-man-sentenced-9-months-prison-buying-13-thousand-in-tether-usdt/amp\">from the transaction</a>. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/76214e73-a7d1-49c4-9bcf-73c886fa0880.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Former Chinese government official Xiao Yi awaits sentencing</em>. | <em>Source: Intermediate People's Court of Hangzhou City</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinese-tvs-crypto-bull-run-report-censored-multichain-crisis-asia-express/\">Chinese TV’s crypto ‘bull run’ report censored, Multichain crisis</a></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template>\n\n</p>\n                \n            "
