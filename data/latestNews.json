Judge Analisa Torres ruled in a summary judgment in July that institutional sales of XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) meet the Howey test and constitute securities sales. </p><p>Ripple <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-united-states-sec-request-financials\">responded to the SEC request</a> with a letter to Judge Netburn on Jan. 19 in which it argued that the discovery phase of the proceedings ended in August 2021 and its conduct since the filing of the suit was irrelevant to the case. Furthermore, its financial condition was also irrelevant since it did not intend to argue that it was unable to pay penalties.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wealth-relevant-penalty-sec-ripple-financials-squabble\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
