It aligns very well with Swiss values.”</blockquote><p>Zanganeh added that the Swiss are typically “strong on individual sovereignty and financial privacy”, which creates overlaps between the values of Swiss culture and those of the Bitcoin movement:</p><blockquote>“Considering the amount of Bitcoin-only companies in Switzerland,it probably has one of the highest density per capita of Bitcoin-only companies around the world.”</blockquote><p>According to Zanganeh, more politicians, diplomats and members of parliament and Switzerland’s financial commission are becoming Bitcoiners which reaffirms a bullish outlook for BTC adoption in the country.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mcdonald-s-pizza-and-coffee-paid-in-bitcoin-the-plan-b-for-crypto-payments\"><strong><em>Related: McDonald’s, pizza and coffee paid in Bitcoin: The Plan B for crypto payments</em></strong></a></p><p>A contributor to increased Bitcoin usage has been a concerted effort to inform and educate the Swiss populace about the merits of BTC:</p><blockquote>“We have regular articles in newspapers where we touch on different aspects of Bitcoin and financial liberty. We try to reach people interested in financial freedom and freedom of speech. Maybe they don't know how Bitcoin plays a role there.”</blockquote><p>While the uptake of Plan ₿’s Bitcoin adoption is a “gradual process”, Zanganeh said that the onboarding of merchants across Lugano has been crucial in opening up a new payments paradigm in the region. </p><p>Likening the process of Bitcoin adoption to the initial proliferation of bank cards some 50 years ago, Zanganeh said that practical experience with novel transactional methods will continue to onboard more users to the Bitcoin ecosystem: </p><blockquote>“If you look at merchants over time, if more and more people go and pay with Bitcoin, you're going to learn.”</blockquote><p>As Cointelegraph previously <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-suisse-explains-why-swiss-is-a-crypto-pivot-point-davos-2023\">explored</a>, Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dr. Dirk Klee highlighted the country’s potential as a center point for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. </p><p>The Canton of Zug is another region of Switzerland that continues to attract <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/switzerland-launches-crypto-valley-association-backed-by-government\">cryptocurrency and blockchain firms</a> due to its progressive, government-backed, crypto-friendly initiatives.</p><p><em>The interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about what it’s like to attend a Bitcoin School.

    "description": "<p>As bitcoin continues to trade sideways in a range, the next sharp move is not far from happening.</p>\nBecalmed, but not for long\n<p>Bitcoin looks to be reasonably comfortable as it sits on support at around $30,000. Not the heights of over $31,000 and a chance at breaking resistance, but a respectable sideways price action that could break soon.</p>\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s only 5 days since bitcoin made a new high for the year, when it rose to $31,500 and looked as though it might break the strongest resistance it&rsquo;s likely to meet in this bull market.</p>\nStrong support below\n<p>However, gravity took its toll and bitcoin has returned back down to $30,000. Should this break further to the downside, there is very strong support at around $29,300 and then down to $28,800. After that there is massive support at $25,000 which would also be bolstered by the 200 MA, plus the upward trendline that started at the beginning of the year.</p>\nDark economic clouds gather\n<p>Things are still incredibly uncertain from an economic perspective. The lower inflation sequence could be about to be broken in the US, while remaining very persistent worldwide, particularly in countries in Europe and especially in the UK.</p>\n<p>On the horizon in August there is the BRICS summit, where a new rival reserve currency to the dollar could potentially be announced. The lack of decent Western mainstream coverage of such an earth-shattering economic event does not bode well for proper preparation from the West.</p>\n<p>Housing crises are also drawing near in many Western countries. UK mortgage holders are getting to the end of their fixed rate mortgages and will need to renegotiate them, facing a potential rise of at least 300% on their current payments.</p>\n<p>In addition, when the Summer comes to an end and Winter begins to demand vastly higher energy bills, an entry into recession will have been all but assured.</p>\nBitcoin about to prove its worth\n<p>How bitcoin will perform in such an economic quagmire is really the million dollar question. So far it hasn&rsquo;t become that inflation hedge that all were hoping for, but this could change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Money printing in the West is likely to start getting ramped up again as these economies desperately fight to get themselves through the Winter. Bitcoin, the scarcest asset in the world, and out of the reach of government manipulation, will have the chance to prove that it is a haven of safety. Those able to buy bitcoin, gold, or silver may want to do so before fiat debasement makes it so much more difficult.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
