He went on to say that that the direction of the “so called” government is clear, adding:</p><blockquote>“Over the past two weeks, the first wave of searches in exchanges took place in Kiev and across Ukraine, which were triggered by the actions of the NBU, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Security Service of Ukraine. [...] There will be more searches and exchanges.”</blockquote><p>Chobanyan told Cointelegraph that Kuna exchange left its business-to-customer market in Ukraine in March 2023 due to “predatory actions” by the NBU.</p><p>“They are very consistent in killing the potential of my country in crypto and Web3 space,” Chobanyan said, noting that Kuna’s exchange volumes have shrunk 90% over the past few months. Previously, Kuna lost about 60% of its volumes when it had to leave the Russian market after Feb. 24, 2022, the CEO told Cointelegraph.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/republican-candidate-end-president-biden-war-on-bitcoin-if-elected\"><strong><em>Republican candidate wants to end President Biden’s supposed ‘war on Bitcoin’ if elected</em></strong></a></p><p>Despite Ukrainian authorities allegedly getting more hostile to the crypto industry, Chobanyan still sees some benefits in the recent action from the government.</p><p>“Now we focus on Europe and especially the b2b market,” he said, adding that Kuna recently launched the crypto acquiring service KunaPay. “I do not know whether it's related to the fear that we will launch this service in Ukraine or not,” Chobanyan said.</p><p>“I am grateful to the NBU for stimulating me being a successful European company rather than a niche Ukrainian player,” he added.</p><p>The NBU accepted Cointelegraph’s request for comment but did not immediately respond to it.
