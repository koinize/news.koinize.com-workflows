The firm has not sold a single share since, <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/2ndqtr23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to its second quarter 2023 earnings report.</p><p>Nu’s share price is currently up nearly 106% year-to-date (YTD), meaning Buffett’s $750 million position is now worth around $879.50 million, assuming Berkshire has still not sold any of its Nu shares. However, at its peak in February 2022, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-buffett-invests-1b-in-bitcoin-friendly-neobank-dumps-visa-and-mastercard-stocks\">the position was worth over $1 billion</a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-buffett-invests-1b-in-bitcoin-friendly-neobank-dumps-visa-and-mastercard-stocks\"></a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/e2e6b3d5-8df5-4632-8940-9ecf9d56c011.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nu daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Why is Nubank crypto-friendly?</h2><p>Nubank has been dubbed crypto-friendly because some of its divisions offer crypto-related services to over 1.35 million users. Therefore, investing in Nubank can be seen as having indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency industry. </p><p>That includes Easynvest, a trading platform that offers a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) product, and Nubank, a digital financial services platform that offers BTC and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) trading. Nubank also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nubank-to-launch-loyalty-tokens-on-the-polygon-blockchain\"></a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nubank-to-launch-loyalty-tokens-on-the-polygon-blockchain\">launched a loyalty token</a> on the Polygon blockchain. </p><p>Moreover, Nu Holdings <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/latin-america-s-largest-digital-bank-will-allocate-1-to-btc-offer-crypto-investment-services\"></a><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/latin-america-s-largest-digital-bank-will-allocate-1-to-btc-offer-crypto-investment-services\">allocated 1% of its cash holdings to Bitcoin</a> in May 2022. </p><p>“This move reinforces the company’s conviction in Bitcoin’s current and future potential in disrupting financial services in the region,” Nubank stated at the time. </p><p>Nubank is the largest fintech bank in Latin America, with over 80 million customers in Brazil.</p><h2>Nu crushes Apple and Amazon stocks</h2><p>Underperforming Nu stocks are Buffett’s other top holdings, Amazon and Apple, which have gained 54.65% and 36%, respectively. Apple is by far the biggest holding of Berkshire Hathaway, comprising roughly 45% of its $354 billion investment portfolio as of September 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-continues-to-outperform-warren-buffett-s-portfolio-and-the-gap-is-set-to-widen\">Bitcoin continues to outperform Warren Buffett’s portfolio, and the gap is set to widen</a></em></strong></p><p>Nu has also outperformed Berkshire Hathaway’s stock, which has risen 9.25% YTD.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/44891aac-0382-4a97-a6f9-de0cc16221bc.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nu vs. Amazon, Apple and Berkshire Hathaway YTD performance chart.
