Despite the exclusion of NFTs, the regulator also noted that there can be exceptions. According to the report, even if the tokens are categorized as NFTs but function as a payment method and are issued in large quantities, they may be included in the virtual asset classification. In this case, the assets may be eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. </p><p>Apart from classifying virtual assets, the South Korean regulator also determined the method for handling user deposits for virtual asset operators.
