Utilizing the b-Cadastros blockchain platform significantly enhances the security and reliability of the National Identity Card project.\"</blockquote><p>According to the local government, the national ID project is crucial in targeting organized crime and allowing government sectors to work together, offering a simpler way to access services, and streamlining administrative records.
