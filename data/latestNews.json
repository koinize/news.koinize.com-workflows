Here are seven alternatives to ChatGPT:</p><h2>Google Bard</h2><p>Google’s experimental conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chat service, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-googles-bard-and-how-does-it-work\">Bard</a>, provides a web-based interactive platform. It functions similarly to ChatGPT but sources its knowledge differently. Like many other AI chatbots, Bard can code, figure out math issues, and help with writing. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/ce6fd05f-92c5-422e-9a4a-f1577bfbd9a7.png\"  /></figure><p>Google Bard is built on the foundation of Transformer, an open-source <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-convolutional-neural-networks\">neural network</a> architecture that also supports LaMDA, Google’s prior Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2), which debuted in late 2022, is what powers it. Users can visit <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">bard.google.com</a>, sign in with their Google Account, and then enter their questions or prompts in the given text box to start a dialogue with Bard.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/googles-bard-vs-open-ais-chatgpt\">Google’s Bard vs. OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a></em></strong></p><h2>Bing AI</h2><p>With the added ease of voice search and conversation, the Bing app enables users to use Bing Conversation whenever and wherever they want. The app ensures a seamless experience by syncing search history and preferences across devices. </p><p>Using OpenAI’s ChatGPT (version 4) Large Language Model(LLM), <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat?form=MT00D8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Microsoft’s Bing Chat</a> is an AI chatbot. In contrast to conventional search engines, Bing Chat provides comprehensive responses to queries rather than just a list of links. In addition to helping with query-related tasks, it can also support activities like composing stories, poems and computer code, as well as data analysis.</p><p>Bing Chat offers tailored and interesting conversations with its three discussion styles — creative, balanced and precise. By providing a chatbot that blends knowledge, imagination and support in an engaging and user-friendly way, Microsoft intends to transform search experiences.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/1043ea22-e2fb-4c9a-92e8-a49b5354e876.png\"  /></figure><h2>ChatSonic</h2><p>Writesonic developed <a href=\"https://chatsonic.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatSonic</a>, a sophisticated Chrome extension, to improve productivity when using Gmail, Twitter, LinkedIn and the internet. ChatSonic is a powerful chatbot with more features than ChatGPT. Chatsonic, as opposed to ChatGPT, uses the internet, references, AI image generation and more to improve one’s conversational experience. </p><p>One’s email workflow can be easily streamlined using ChatSonic:</p><ul><li>Create top-notch emails right from Gmail.</li><li>Quickly grasp complicated emails and threads and summarize them.</li><li>Get complete email conversation timeline summaries.</li><li>Respond to emails right away to save time.</li></ul><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/461c5b0d-c369-4480-9bb2-e8f6eb1bc865.png\"  /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/f6cf9ba2-90d0-433a-b889-2cd5f5cb2af1.png\"  /></figure><h2>You.com</h2><p>Bryan McCann, a seasoned pioneer in AI, and Richard Socher, a former chief scientist at Salesforce, co-founded <a href=\"https://you.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">You.com</a>, which is revolutionizing the search experience. You.com enables people to seek less and create more thanks to a collection of generative AI tools and a dedication to privacy. </p><p>YouChat, a conversational AI interface that delivers quick answers and content development with sophisticated AI capabilities, is one of the features available in the Chrome extension. YouCode, a different part of You.com, functions as a specialized coding search engine that makes it simple for coders to locate and copy/paste code fragments from more than 20 coding sources.</p><p>One of You.com’s main advantages is the emphasis it places on privacy. Users are shielded from data sharing, targeted advertising and online tracking when YouChat is chosen as their primary search engine. Because the extension is open-source, users can confirm the rights requested, ensuring accountability and user control. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/27c2c7e0-23ea-4090-b682-57321867c6d0.png\"  /></figure><p>The lack of intrusive advertisements makes each result more valuable, further enhancing the You.com search experience. Users have the flexibility and convenience to change the default search engine they use among You.com, YouChat, YouCode and Google. </p><h2>Jasper AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.jasper.ai/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jasper Chat</a> is a new conversational AI platform that, like ChatGPT, provides a more interactive and natural way of engaging with generative AI. It utilizes OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 language model and is specifically designed for business applications, such as marketing and sales. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/b7babbc8-3325-4571-a7c8-d6f9899beb87.png\"  /></figure><p>While both Jasper Chat and ChatGPT seek to increase AI’s usability, Jasper Chat is more concerned with meeting the demands of enterprises. Jasper Chat provides a risk-free opportunity to investigate the writing talents of AI with a seven-day free trial and cost-effective pricing plans starting at just $39 per month (including Creator, which can be used to fetch watermark-free, limitless high-resolution image production).</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-chatgpt-chrome-extensions\">5 ChatGPT chrome extensions to enhance productivity</a></em></strong></p><h2>Perplexity AI</h2><p>An alternative to ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Perplexity AI</a>, has been trained using OpenAI’s API and provides impressive responses. The website has a straightforward and minimalist layout. Similar to ChatGPT, it enables users to converse and receive responses that range from straightforward to complex. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/96d64b52-bf0b-422d-9547-65c22ed0a176.png\"  /></figure><p>Perplexity stands out because of its unique ability to cite and derive information from the sources it uses to respond to queries, such as Wikipedia. Also, it does not copy-paste content from the sources it uses to fetch information, demonstrating that Perplexity diligently presents authentic information.</p><h2>GitHub Copilot</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GitHub Copilot</a> is an AI-powered pair programmer that enhances your coding experience by providing autocomplete-style suggestions. It offers two ways to receive suggestions: You can either start writing the code you need, and Copilot will generate relevant suggestions, or you can write a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-natural-language-processing-libraries-to-use\">natural language</a> comment describing the desired functionality, and Copilot will provide corresponding code suggestions. This intelligent tool assists you in writing code more efficiently and effectively, making the development process smoother and faster.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/3dce329b-a1c2-432f-95f0-b9b729674df9.png\"  /></figure><p>GitHub Copilot seamlessly integrates with popular development environments, such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments. The two solutions for managing accounts offered by GitHub Copilot are GitHub Copilot for individuals and GitHub Copilot for businesses. Individuals can use GitHub Copilot through personal accounts, and organizations can manage it through organization accounts.</p><p>GitHub Copilot is free to use for some groups. Users who have been verified as students, instructors or maintainers of well-known open-source projects are free to use GitHub Copilot. If you do not fit into one of these categories, you can take advantage of GitHub Copilot’s free 30-day trial offer. For continued access and use, however, a paid subscription is necessary after the trial period has ended.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"consulting_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

It’s nothing that existed before Bitcoin, and Bitcoin has only been around since 2009,” he added.</p><p>While allowing investors to be their own banks, the concept of self-custody also makes users the sole responsible entity for the safety of their Bitcoin. The most important part of this responsibility is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happens-if-you-lose-or-break-your-hardware-crypto-wallet\">keeping your private key, or seed phrase, safe and private</a>.</p><p>Security, privacy and usability have always been key parts of self-custody as well as Trezor’s proposition, Zak said. “But the usability, you know, plays a really important part,” the CEO noted, adding that Trezor is still trying to make its hardware wallets as user-friendly as possible. The exec stated:</p><blockquote>“Usability is the one where you want to make things easier, more simple to use. So all those people coming from exchanges can actually feel at home and not be scared by losing their private keys.”</blockquote><p>By increasing usability, Trezor hopes to double or even triple the amount of hardware wallet users around the world in the next three to four years. Citing some estimates, Zak said that less than 2% of all 420 million crypto users globally currently use hardware wallets.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/215f9abc-bdd2-4f0a-b801-ad0f4452e43e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Trezor CEO Matej Zak at BTC Prague conference. Source: Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>Focus on usability is part of the reason the Trezor CEO also believes that complicated self-custody wallet setups like multisignature, or multisig, may not be the best solution for newcomers to the industry.</p><p>Unlike common Bitcoin wallet setups, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/secure-encryption-key-management-modules-explained\">Multisig involves using more than one public key</a> to authorize a transaction, which is designed to increase security of self-custody.</p><p>“Security at the expense of usability, comes at the expense of security,” Zak said, referring to a quote by Bounce Security CEO Avi Douglen.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-hackers-swipe-over-100m-from-atomic-wallet-users\"><strong><em>North Korean hackers swipe over $100M from Atomic Wallet users</em></strong></a></p><p>While focusing on usability and education, Trezor doesn't plan to introduce any new built-in features to help users recover their private keys, though.</p><p>According to the CEO, Trezor has done everything possible to help its customers secure their seed phrase. Zak mentioned implementations like the Shamir backup, which is often used to distribute the private key phrase among different locations. Introduced by Trezor in 2019, the Shamir backup is designed to keep user’s Bitcoin safe from theft or accidents.</p><p>“There's nothing we could improve on in this regard because the usability is good,” Trezor CEO said.</p><p>The remarks from Trezor 's CEO come a few weeks after rival hardware wallet supplier Ledger teased a new tool allowing users to recover their private keys. Following criticism from the crypto community, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-recover-paused-code-will-open-source\">Ledger later postponed the launch of Ledger Recover</a>, with Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier claiming that it was a “humbling experience” and the result of miscommunication.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-bedford-soccer-team-puts-bitcoin-on-the-map/\"><strong><em>Peter McCormack’s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Polygon (MATIC), a blockchain scalability platform, finds itself in the grip of negative sentiment that casts a shadow over its prospects for a strong price recovery. The crypto market has been a volatile space, prone to sudden shifts in sentiment, and MATIC is no exception. The recent downturn in the sentiment surrounding MATIC has left investors and traders cautiously observing the price charts. Once considered a promising project in the crypto space, Polygon&#8217;s potential for growth has been impeded by the recent actions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission against altcoins. Will the negative sentiment continue to hinder MATIC’s potential for a strong price recovery?

The latest data on MATIC reveals that the pressure from US regulators has not seemed to totally unsettle some prominent investors, as evidenced by a notable increase in whale transactions exceeding $1 million in recent days. Source: Santiment However, despite the increase in whale appetite, the cryptocurrency has failed to sustain a strong upward momentum at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap reports MATIC&#8217;s current price as $0.5818, reflecting a decline of 2.33% within the past 24 hours. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a substantial slump of 25.93% over the past seven days. In addition to the impact of regulatory pressure, the movements of MATIC&#8217;s supply on exchanges, which serves as an indicator of short-term selling pressure, have exhibited rapid fluctuations during the same period. MATIC 24-hour price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap It experienced a sharp increase, followed by a decline, and then another spike before eventually easing at the time of publication. These developments indicate that the selling pressure on MATIC remains a significant concern, primarily due to the prevailing regulatory uncertainty. MATIC market cap currently at $5.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Fed&#8217;s Pause On Rate Hikes Fails To Stabilize Crypto Markets On the whole, financial markets have continued to exhibit volatile movements, causing cryptocurrencies to decouple from the performance of traditional equities markets. The recent downturn in the crypto market seems to be linked to the press conference held by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on June 14, during which he announced that the central bank would temporarily halt rate hikes for the month of June. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: Assessing The Ripple-Colombia Central Bank Partnership While this decision aligned with investors&#8217; expectations, it had an unexpected effect on the crypto market. Instead of stabilizing, the market experienced a reversal in its course and resumed the ongoing sell-off that has persisted for the past three weeks. The presence of substantial macroeconomic challenges, coupled with the anticipation of future rate hikes and low trading volume, suggests that the volatility in the cryptocurrency market is likely to persist in the foreseeable future.  The prevailing headwinds, including economic factors on a larger scale, have contributed to the unpredictability and turbulence in the crypto market.
