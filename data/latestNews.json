    "description": "Bulls pushed back and momentarily halted the increasing selling pressure impacting Cardano, Solana, and Ethereum. The altcoin market has been stabilizing over the last day, but fresh data points to potential issues in the short term. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here’s When As of this writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.23 with sideways movement in the past day. Solana and Ethereum recorded similar price action over this period, but these assets have been slowly bleeding into support on the weekly chart. Cardano, Solana, And Altcoins Could Get Hit Data shared by the Co-Founders of crypto analysis firm Glassnode via social media platform X indicates a rise in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). The metric was slowly trending to the downside, but it found some support yesterday and could be poised to regain previously lost territory. The metric measures the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization comprised of Bitcoin. In addition, whenever BTC.D reaches a certain point, it often leads to mini altcoin bull or bear markets. The metric could hint at further losses for Cardano, Solana, and other tokens in the current scenario. The Glassnode Co-Founders stated: It&#8217;s not just ETH feeling the heat; other major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, Tron, Polkadot, and Polygon are also deep in the red. With Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance climbing past 51%, inching closer to its 2021 peak, altcoins are indeed feeling the pressure. To see the resurgence of the much-awaited Altcoins Season, a significant recovery will be essential. As seen in the chart below, the Bitcoin Altcoin Cycle chart is moving closer to a “Bitcoin Season,” as indicated by the blue line. As Bitcoin Dominance trends upwards into the 50% territory, altcoins will likely keep seeing losses in the short time frame. However, the Bitcoin Altcoin Cycle chart shows that the BTC.D stands at a critical zone. The metric has bounced back into the Altcoin Season Territory in the past. In particular, Cardano, Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and other altcoins enjoyed a substantial rally in July. If Bitcoin can’t produce a catalyzer, something to push it above the 50% area in dominance, then Altcoins can see some profits.

On this cryptocurrency’s price action, the Glassnode co-founder stated: From its weekly resistance at $1,744, ETH has tumbled, marking an 8% decline in just two weeks, landing it at $1,574. While the price seems to be consolidating, the upward slope of the RSI suggests buyers are vying for higher levels. Yet, with sellers resisting this advance, they might (…).
