    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-100-crypto-analyst/",
    "description": "Dogecoin has seen a number of bullish predictions over the last month, especially with the recovery of the crypto market. The latest in this long line of bullish predictions is that of one crypto analyst who goes by southofearth on TradingView. According to the analyst, the DOGE price will rally higher than expectations. Dogecoin Price Maintains Previous Patterns The analysis which was posted on the TradingView website shows the trajectory of the Dogecoin price since it was launched back in 2013. The chart highlights the performance of DOGE in the years leading up to each Bitcoin halving and how this can pinpoint its rally point. Related Reading: Total ETH Burned Crosses 1.5 Million Ahead Of Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Both times have seen the Dogecoin price put on a massive rally after each halving, suggesting that it is a bullish trigger for the meme coin. With the next Bitcoin halving expected to take place sometime in April, the DOGE price looks to be gearing up for another breakout. The crypto analyst points out that DOGE is currently showing a similar pattern as it had in the previous years, although with a bit more volatility. But because it is mostly maintaining this pattern, the chances of it following the same patter of rallying are high. They also explain that the markets are moving faster, and the 4-year cycle that investors are used to might be getting shorter. Given this, the bull market begins faster, although with longer bear markets. In this case, the analyst believes that the DOGE price could top out in October of 2024 instead of in 2025 as expected. Source: TradingView.com DOGE Price Targets For Bull Market Southofearth also shared their price targets for Dogecoin going forward, with four targets in total. The first puts the price at $1, which looks to be the start of the breakout. From there, the next target is placed at 1005 from the first target at $2.

According to the crypto analyst, $27 is the next all-time high price for DOGE going by what has happened to the coin in previous years. However, it doesn’t end there, as the analyst predicted that the DOGE price could possibly rise to $100 and above. But for this to happen, there has to be “hyperbitcoinization happens due to dollar index breaking down,” the analyst explains. If the crypto analyst is correct, then the DOGE price could see a 16,000% move from here. However, the possibility of this happening is very slim given that DOGE’s market cap is already at $20 billion, and such a move would make it larger than Ethereum.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-skyrockets-to-new-all-time-high-soaring-60-following-two-major-listings/",
    "description": "Web3 project and meme coin Floki Inu (FLOKI) has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market. It has witnessed an impressive uptrend of over 630% in the past 30 days alone. As a result, it has soared to the 64th position in market capitalization, surpassing $2 billion. This surge in price comes as notable digital asset firms, including DWF Labs, have recognized FLOKI as a potential long-term investment, resulting in a $10 million purchase plan. This move pushed FLOKI to a 9-month high of $0.00005097 on February 27th. However, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s popularity has spread to other jurisdictions, and it recently hit an all-time high (ATH), trading at $0.0002043, coupled with a 58% uptrend in the past 24 hours.  FLOKI Targets New Asian And Middle Eastern Investors Coinhako, a regulated crypto exchange in Singapore under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has endorsed FLOKI by listing the token among its tradable cryptocurrencies. In an official announcement, Coinhako stated, &#8220;The people&#8217;s cryptocurrency has reached Coinhako&#8217;s shores and is available to trade.&#8221; The Floki Inu team expressed their excitement about the listing, highlighting that crypto users in Singapore can now buy FLOKI with SGD and USD on a regulated exchange. They believe this listing is a significant milestone that will accelerate Floki&#8217;s vision to become the world&#8217;s most recognized and widely used cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls On Alert: Top Analyst Anticipates A Big Spike In The Cards In addition, the Floki Inu team has announced that the meme coin has been successfully listed on CoinMENA, one of the prominent crypto exchanges catering to retail and institutional clients in the Middle East. CoinMENA is a licensed and regulated entity by the Central Bank of Bahrain and the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority in Dubai, which aims to ensure a safe and compliant trading environment for investors. The team behind the project commented on the matter: This is a MAJOR listing for Floki adoption and our goal to become the world&#8217;s most known and most used cryptocurrency as it introduces Floki to key and affluent players in the Middle East and Arab regions. Massive Exposure In Times Square The Floki Inu team has launched an “aggressive” marketing campaign to drive adoption further and attract additional investments. Starting from March 15th and lasting for three months, Floki will be featured prominently on a massive double-sided HD LED screen in Times Square Plaza, New York.  This digital exhibition, located beside the Nasdaq billboard, will showcase a ten-second advertisement for Floki at least four times per hour, airing for 20 hours a day over 93 days.  This campaign will deliver a minimum of 7,440 ten-second spots, taking advantage of Times Square&#8217;s daily foot traffic of 330,000 visitors and an annual influx of 50 million people.  According to the announcement, the goal is to solidify Floki&#8217;s association with meme coins in people&#8217;s minds and take advantage of what the team expects to be the most &#8220;explosive bull run&#8221; in the crypto market.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/",
    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been gaining a lot of traction lately, with the meme token seeing an increase in the number of addresses created. This uptrend in the crypto token’s expansion is significant as it could spark a surge in SHIB’s price and possibly a new all-time high (ATH).  Shiba Inu Sees 2,000% Increase In Daily Addresses Data from the Market Intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that SHIB has been attracting over 8,400 new daily addresses in March. This represents almost a 20 times increase from its February daily average. The meme coin’s new daily addresses peaked on March 5, recording 21,000 addresses. Related Reading: Wall Street Expert Says $100 XRP Price Prediction Has Expired, What Does This Mean? The reason for the increase in SHIB’s adoption is not farfetched, as the Shiba Inu team has continued to implement exciting initiatives that are attracting new investors into the ecosystem. One of these initiatives includes the launch of K9 Finance, a liquid staking derivatives (LSD) platform on the Shibarium network. Liquid staking looks to be one of the leading narratives of this bull cycle (something that has increased Ethereum’s network activity), and there is no doubt that K9 Finance can also help the Shiba Inu ecosystem achieve the same results.  Meanwhile, blockchain analytics platform Santiment recently highlighted how AI tokens and Meme coins look to be the leading altcoins at the moment. As such, it is unsurprising that investors will want to position themselves with SHIB, the second-largest meme coin by market cap.  The increased interest in SHIB since the beginning of March is already reflecting positively on its price, with the crypto token seeing a gain of over 162% in the last seven days. A sustained increase in SHIB’s adoption will help the meme coin maintain this bullish momentum. SHIB Gunning For Its All-Time High SHIB’s all-time high (ATH) currently stands at $0.0008, and with its current bullish momentum, there is a growing belief that it won’t be long before it surpasses that price level. The fact that the bull market also looks to be in full force already makes SHIB hitting a new ATH very possible.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Uses Historical Data To Show When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $207,000 Interestingly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez had predicted that SHIB could rise to as high as $0.011. Although that price level still looks very ambitious, it is one to keep an eye on as the meme coin continues its upward trend. Meanwhile, the Doge community will be on high alert as Dogecoin (DOGE) risks losing its crown to SHIB as the most valuable meme coin.  At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00003346, up almost 10% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.  SHIB bulls regain control of price &#124; Source: SHIBUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"
