Source: YCharts</figcaption></figure><p>Torres noted there are legitimate reasons why a user would have multiple wallet addresses.</p><p>“One of them can be explained easily as ‘privacy concerns.’ People like to have different addresses just to not leave a big enough footprint out there,” he explained. </p><p>It could also be due to automated traders deploying multiple strategies on-chain. </p><blockquote>“So when we see automatic trading on-chain, usually each address is very focused on a different protocol or different swap, or trading different coins or trading different coins using different strategies.”</blockquote><p>However, it has also been used for malicious purposes such as inflating a project’s active user numbers to mislead potential investors, creating a Sybil attack also known as a 51% attack or users trying to game an upcoming token airdrop. </p><p>One example came from the anticipated Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 23 which saw <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-airdrop-sees-1-500-addresses-consolidate-3-3m-into-two-wallets\">two wallets amass 2.7 million ARB</a> from 1,496 wallets in a strategy known as “airdrop farming.” In contrast, the median airdrop size was only <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-arbitrum-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">expected</a> to be 1,250 ARB tokens, according to CoinMarketCap. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We found 2 super airdrop hunters of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ARB</a>.<br><br>0xe1e2 received 1.4M <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ARB</a>($1.92M) via 866 addresses and added all 1.4M <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ARB</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Uniswap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Uniswap</a> to provide liquidity.<a href=\"https://t.co/sncsZTHrP2\">https://t.co/sncsZTHrP2</a><br><br>0xbd4e received 933,375 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$ARB</a>($1.28M) via 630 addresses.<a href=\"https://t.co/p5vbqXMYxD\">https://t.co/p5vbqXMYxD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yK3LzbeC8t\">pic.twitter.com/yK3LzbeC8t</a></p>&mdash; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1639165562663358466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>“On blockchain, it's very easy to control multiple public addresses,” Torres noted. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/shibarium-one-million-wallets-shiba-inu-shib-price-slump\"><strong><em>Shibarium hits 1M wallets amid meteoric growth, SHIB yet to catch up</em></strong></a></p><p>Torres explained unlike email addresses, creating and controlling multiple crypto wallets isn’t too complicated if you know what you’re doing. </p><p>Some use what is known as HD wallets — <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-hierarchical-deterministic-hd-crypto-wallets\">hierarchical deterministic wallets</a> — which generate a new key pair from a master key pair.
