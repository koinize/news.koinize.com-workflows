During the last crypto bull cycle, most blockchain games tried to be financial products first and video games second. </p><p>That strategy helped catapult the play-to-earn gaming sector into brief mainstream prominence when token prices were going up. But unfortunately, if the appeal is based on delivering a financial return, then enthusiasm can disappear fast when token prices take a dive. </p><p>Games like Axie Infinity, Pegaxy or Crabada, which once promised spectacular returns for players, have since fallen off a cliff. For Axie, unique active wallets <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/dapp/axie-infinity?range-ha=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >peaked</a> at around 700,000 in November 2021 but now tally more often in the eight to 10,000 range today.</p><p>The Metaverse Index (MVI) token, which tracks a collection of major gaming and metaverse tokens, is down 95.6% from its all-time high in November 2021.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MIT.jpg\" alt=\"MIT\" class=\"wp-image-22699\" width=\"741\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MIT.jpg 932w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MIT-300x185.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MIT-770x475.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Metaverse Index token has been on a wild ride.

With Web2 games, its much harder to pull off those types of scams.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Axie-Infinity-now-has-a-much-more-finite-number-of-players.png\" alt=\"Axie Infinity now has a much more finite number of players\" class=\"wp-image-22639\" width=\"669\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Axie-Infinity-now-has-a-much-more-finite-number-of-players.png 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Axie-Infinity-now-has-a-much-more-finite-number-of-players-300x179.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Axie Infinity now has a much more finite number of players.

The game state refers to the current status of the gaming world, such as player progression and the items they possess, while game logic simply refers to the rules of the game  how players move, interact, collect and consume. </p><p>Why bother with having it all on-chain? Doing so ensures the games state is always immutable and transparent on the blockchain. But most importantly, it opens the door to the same kind of open composability that is possible in DeFi and enables an aggregator like the 1inch Network to build on top of Uniswap or Curve to integrate Synthetix and allow for cross-asset swaps. </p><p>Composability allows anyone to build second-layer rules on top of the games original rules. Second-layer rules in fully on-chain games exist in the form of smart contracts on top of the core game developers original smart contracts. They are simultaneously experienced by all players in the game, unlike third-party mods in traditional gaming that simply alter the players local gaming experience.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/building-blocks-millennials-use-crypto-tokens-property-ladder/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Building blocks: Gen Y can use tokens to get on the property ladder</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/fungible-fan-tokens-forming-proxy-market-day-trade-sports-teams-at-high-valuations/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Fan tokens: Day trading your favorite sports team</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><h2><strong>Collective action</strong></h2><p>Take, for example, the on-chain RPG Dark Forest, built on the Gnosis chain in 2019 by pseudonymous <a href=\"https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/dark-forest-lessons-from-3-years-of-on-chain-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >creator</a> Gubsheep.

Weeks into the launch of the game, one player, calling himself SupremeLeaderOP, created a communist society where any player that opted into the guild would give up all their resources and share them with every other player in the society. </p><p>These rules were not a social promise between players. They were binding and tied to an on-chain smart contract. SupremeLeaderOP could not, even if he so desired, rescind his promises to players or bend the rules of his communist guild. Some players saw the guild as a wacky fun experiment and immediately swore allegiance to the communist Republic, in the process, giving up all their in-game resources in return for access to the guilds collective treasury. As <a href=\"https://lattice.xyz/blog/making-of-opcraft-part-3-what-happened-in-two-weeks-of-OPCraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >documented</a> on the Lattice blog: </p><p>Once a player had become a comrade, they were able to  through smart contracts that the Supreme Leader had deployed  mine material for the government treasury and build using treasury material on top of government owned land! The Republic even had a social credit system to prevent freeloading comrades from spending more material from the treasury than they have contributed. Free loading comrades were not allowed to build anymore until they had repaired their social credit through contributing their labor.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Comrades, I created a smart contract world government, giving members of our splendid republic access to our vast treasury of blocks and land.

Its a level of bottom-up spontaneous creative expression that extends far beyond how we traditionally think of video gaming, but in the Web2 world, experimenters tinkering around on custom game mods eventually spawned billion-dollar game franchises such as Dota and Counter-Strike. Dota was first created permissionlessly as a mod on Blizzards Warcraft 3 game, while Counter-Strike was birthed from a mod on Valves Half-Life game. </p><p>The on-chain gaming space is nascent, and builders in this space still refer to fully on-chain games very differently. The popular autonomous worlds <a href=\"https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds?ref=bankless.ghost.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >label</a> was coined by Lattice Labs, but other builders in the on-chain space have referred to the concept as <a href=\"https://bibliothecadao.xyz/?ref=bankless.ghost.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >eternal games</a>, <a href=\"https://ronan.eth.limo/blog/infinite-games/?ref=bankless.ghost.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >infinite games</a> or <a href=\"https://www.guiltygyoza.xyz/2022/08/game2-in-schematics?ref=bankless.ghost.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >on-chain realities</a>.</p><p>Although the terminology varies, the common denominator underlying these games is hard permanence on the blockchain. Just as smart contracts and tokens will forever exist on-chain, fully on-chain games remain fully uncensorable and alive long after a gaming studio abandons the game.</p><p>The tradeoff? Most on-chain crypto games currently resemble turn-based board games with simple game loops like Space Invaders and Pac-Man in the early era of video games.</p><h2><strong>Limitations, limitations, limitations</strong></h2><p>In creating the on-chain racing game Rhauscau, creator Stokarz tells Magazine he had to make a bunch of necessary tradeoffs in game design due to cost limitations.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The reason why most on-chain games follow a traditional board game design with minimal game logic is because executing it all on-chain is inexpensive. On the smart contract level, its a one-dimensional play with agents simply changing the positioning of the play.</p></blockquote><p>Although Rhauscau is deployed on the layer-2 Arbitrum Nova, which boasts a throughput speed far higher than Ethereum mainnet, the game is still limited to simple game loops that last five minutes tops.</p><p>The first tradeoff with Rhauscaus game design was that it had to be centered around one simple game loop. Too complex games mean more transaction speeds, which would make it too costly for users to pay for it. Its similar to early mobile games like Cut the Rope, Stokarz added.</p><p>Partially decentralized Web2.5 games dont face the same trade-offs as on-chain games because the only crypto layer within their games is assets in the form of nonfungible tokens. </p><p>But they make an important sacrifice in another regard: the games open composability.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/who-takes-gold-in-crypto-blockchain-olympics/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-meet-fiat-coffee/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Crypto, Meet Fiat.

Game designers should think harder about how to harvest the full affordances of a blockchain ledger in their game design.</p><p>But blockchain and software infrastructure is an issue.</p><p>On old video games, we saw simplistic text adventure games first.
