Bank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring,” he argued.</p><p>Given the current steep rise in the 2s30s curve — the difference between the 30-year and 2-year yields — combined with rising long and short-term interest rates, the pressure across the economy is rising.</p><p>“Due to the leverage and non-linear risks embedded in banks' portfolios, they will be selling bonds or paying fixed on IRS as rates rise. More selling, begets more selling, which is no bueno for bond prices,” Hayes continued.</p><p>The result should be clear — a return to mass liquidity injections, counteracting the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-faces-considerable-danger-from-fed-in-2023-lyn-alden\">quantitative tightening</a> seen since late 2021 which has pressured crypto markets.</p><p>For Hayes, this cannot come without major casualties along the way. He concluded:</p><blockquote>“The faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognises there is no way out other than money printing to save govt bond markets, the faster we get back to the crypto bull market :). The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.”</blockquote><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/2dad224f-adad-468f-a6f2-d5cf5ca58197.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>U.S. 30-year bonds yield 1-month chart.
