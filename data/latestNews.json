As part of this investment, SDF has secured a seat on MoneyGram&#8217;s Board of Directors, granting the foundation an opportunity to contribute to MoneyGram&#8217;s future and digital strategy actively.

Furthermore, the investment positions SDF to play a vital role in various aspects of MoneyGram&#8217;s journey, including the expansion of its digital business, exploration of blockchain technology, and support for the company&#8217;s overarching mission of facilitating secure and efficient global money movement for individuals and businesses across multiple countries.
