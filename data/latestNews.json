    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/906-million-worth-of-ethereum-leave-exchanges-last-week-eth-to-4000/",
    "description": "Exchange data has revealed continued bullish sentiment from Ethereum traders. According to IntoTheBlock, $906 million worth of Ethereum was withdrawn from crypto exchanges last week, indicating a holding mentality among investors. This massive exodus of ETH from exchanges could indicate that traders are anticipating higher prices and moving their holdings into private wallets for long-term storage. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Parabolic Rally For Cardano – Here’s The Timeline The holding attitude has emerged amid a wider spike in the price of cryptocurrencies throughout the market and numerous demands for Ethereum to cross over $4,000 and beyond. Ethereum Sees Massive Exodus From Exchanges Exchange data typically helps give an overview of the supply and demand dynamics of crypto assets. When the supply of an asset declines on exchanges, it indicates holders have a long-term view.  In this vein, exchange data from IntoTheBlock concerning Ethereum has shown the dynamics tipping to the demand side as investors have increased their accumulation of the industry&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency since the beginning of the year.  More importantly, outflows of Ethereum from exchanges totaled $906 million last week to mark eight consecutive weeks of outflows.  $906M of $ETH left exchanges this week, making it the eighth consecutive week of net outflows for the second-largest crypto asset pic.twitter.com/v7VuqFUSCf — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 1, 2024 This outflow pattern has been reaffirmed by a comparable exchange metric on CryptoQuant. Since January 10, the total amount of Ethereum on exchange reserves has decreased by more than 1 million ETH, and it currently stands at 13.7 million ETH. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.272 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com What’s Next For Ethereum? The massive outflow from exchanges can be attributed to Ethereum bulls looking to push the crypto to new highs. Ethereum has gone on a sustained upward trend in the past few months to outperform majority of altcoins. At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $3,392, up by 46% in the past 30 days. If anything, the increase in outflow from exchanges is a signal for a continued uptrend and ETH is now on its way to reaching the $3,500 mark again after a brief crossover on February 29. The bullish action has prompted investors to look forward to Ethereum breaking into $4,000 again towards its all-time high of $4,878. With decreasing supply on exchanges, the price of ETH is poised to rise. A breach of the $4,000 level seems imminent, and from there, a run-up to $4,900 could happen quickly.  Related Reading: Solana Meme Coin Dogwifhat (WIF) Hits New ATH, Market Cap Breaks $1.6 Billion A crypto analyst known as Trader Alan pointed out that recent price action has seen Ethereum perfecting a bullish breakout and retest on the monthly chart. According to the price chart shared by the analyst, a strong bullish movement could see ETH reaching $7,000 by the end of 2024, as well as exceeding $10,000 and $15,000 in the coming years.
