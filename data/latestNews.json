Cointelegraph spoke with a long-time Atomic's client who is now a victim of the security breach. \"I felt terrible because I am a cybersecurity expert by profession,\" said Emre, a Turkish resident who lost nearly $1 million in crypto assets received from bug bounty programs. His stolen tokens include Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>), Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>), Ethereum (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), USDT, USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>), Binance Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>), and Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>). </p><p>\"They say they're looking into it, but they don't have anything concrete yet,\" Emre continued. The funds held at Atomic Wallet were destined for the establishment of a cybersecurity firm in Turkey.</p><p>Atomic is a noncustodial-decentralized wallet, meaning users are responsible for assets stored in the application.
