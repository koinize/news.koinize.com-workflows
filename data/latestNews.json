    "description": "Tron price is eyeing a fresh increase from the $0.1112 support against the US Dollar. TRX is outperforming Bitcoin and could rise further above $0.1140. Tron is moving higher above the $0.1120 resistance level against the US dollar. The price is trading above $0.1125 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance at $0.1126 on the 4-hour chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to climb higher toward $0.1165 or even $0.1200. Tron Price Restarts Increase Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a major rejection. However, Tron price remained stable above the $0.1100 support. Earlier, there was a steady increase toward the $0.1165 level before TRX started a downside correction. There was a move below the $0.1150 level. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1059 swing low to the $0.1165 high. The bulls are now protecting the $0.1125 support zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Tron is now moving higher and trading above $0.1120. There was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance at $0.1126 on the 4-hour chart of the TRX/USD pair. Source: TRXUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.1140 level. The first major resistance is near $0.1150, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is near $0.1165. A close above the $0.1165 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1200. The next major resistance is near the $0.1125 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.1300. Are Dips Supported in TRX? If TRX price fails to clear the $0.1140 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1120 zone. The first major support is near the $0.1100 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1059 swing low to the $0.1165 high, below which it could test $0.1085. Any more losses might send Tron toward the $0.1050 support in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for TRX/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for TRX/USD is currently above the 50 level.
