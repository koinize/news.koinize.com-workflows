    "description": "Bitcoin&#8217;s surge past $35,000 on the 24th and 25th of October took the crypto world by surprise, as it indicated what might be the beginning of a new bullish sentiment. Trading volumes for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency hit their highest levels since March, showing that interest in Bitcoin is booming once more. The entire crypto market saw an inflow of funds during the week, leading to a surge in market cap. Data from CoinGecko shows that the entire market cap increased from $1.184 trillion on Sunday, October 22, to $1.312 trillion on Wednesday, October 25. Most of this inflow went into Bitcoin, which saw its share of the cryptocurrency market increase from 49.58% to 51.47 % during this same time period.Â  Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Rules Weekend Top 50 Crypto Ranking With 60% Hike â€“ Hereâ€™s Why Chart From CoinGecko Daily Crypto Exchange Volumes Reach 8-Month High The recent boom in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices pushed Bitcoin daily trading volumes on crypto exchanges to their highest level since March.

In comparison, Bitcoin trading volume on exchanges was at $11.02 billion on the first day of the month.Â  Chart from The Block A similar metric from IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin transactions reaching 1.4 million BTC as bulls looked to push Bitcoin to $35,000. Chart from IntoTheBlock Trading volumes are an important metric because higher volumes suggest greater interest and activity in a market. It means more people are actively buying and selling, leading to more liquidity and volatility. Whale activity also increased during this time period, as indicated by on-chain trackers.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $34,150, still up by 14.47% in a 7-day timeframe. While price action seems to be moving sideways at the moment, there are still hopes of continued momentum from the bulls to push BTC past $35,000 in the new week.Â  Related Reading: Aptos TVL Soars To A Record $74 Million, Reflecting Growing Investor Confidence Matt Hougan, CEO of crypto index fund manager Bitwise, has hinted at a further inflow of money into Bitcoin.

Others like crypto financial services platform Matrixport have made more optimistic claims.Â  Data from analytics platform mempool.space has shown a sustained increase in activity on the BTC network.
