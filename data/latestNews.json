    "description": "Arbitrum (ARB), a layer 2 (L2) protocol has achieved yet another major milestone in its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaching new heights, following a surge in the crypto asset&#8217;s price. Arbitrum Sees Surge In Total Value Locked (TVL) According to the L2beat platform, Arbitrum&#8217;s TVL recently went past the $10 billion mark putting it in the spotlight. Data from the analytics firm reveals that the network&#8217;s TVL is currently at $10.36 billion. L2beat&#8217;s report shows that Arbitrum One&#8217;s TVL soared by a remarkable 16.49% over the past seven days. With this accomplishment, the network is firmly established as the first Layer 2 network to surpass the $10 billion TVL threshold. Related Reading: Arbitrum: What’s In Store For ARB Token After Unlock? L2beat shows that Arbitrum is above Optimism (OP) by about 40% which comes in second place with a TVL of $6.44 billion. Optimism&#8217;s TVL has also increased significantly by 11.63% in the last 24 hours.  When analyzing Arbitrum&#8217;s TVL, Ethereum (ETH) makes up about 30% of the TVL, while the ARB token makes up about 23.68%. Meanwhile, stablecoins make up a substantial portion of 29% of the TVL, with the remaining 15.76% going to other assets. This diverse composition highlights the platform&#8217;s increasing popularity and attractiveness to a larger range of users. In addition, L2beat has also revealed a surge in the network&#8217;s market share. The data shows that Arbitrum One&#8217;s market share has seen an increase of over 48%.  So far, the network&#8217;s token ARB seems to have experienced a rise in response to the rise in TVL. The digital asset price is currently set at $1.84, indicating a 2.82% increase in the past day. As of the time of writing, the network&#8217;s trading volume has increased significantly by 60% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its market capitalization is up by 1% in the past day, according to data from CoinMarketcap The price rise is indicative of investors&#8217; increased faith and interest in Arbitrum&#8217;s ecosystem. The network&#8217;s success also highlights the growing need in the Ethereum ecosystem for scalable and affordable solutions. Analyst Predicts A Clear Uptrend For ARB Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has predicted a clear uptrend for Arbitrum, signaling a possible breakout. The analyst shared his projections for the token on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Arbitrum Network Faces Major Outage, ARB Token Faces 4% Decline In his analysis, he noted that the uptrend is &#8220;taking place with beautiful retests of previous resistances, becoming a support zone.&#8221; Poppe further pointed out a possible retest optimal “go-to level” between $1.50-1.60.  This area denotes a tactical stage where the token might experience a retest before opting to breach the psychological barrier of $2.  However, this will only take place if the ARB continues on the current upward path. Lastly, Poppe highlighted a difficulty in the token initiating its first cycle when put against Bitcoin. &#8220;Against $BTC, this pair barely wakes up and starts its first cycle,&#8221; he stated. With the recent price of Arbitrum sitting at $1.84, it appears that the analyst&#8217;s predictions will soon come to pass. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"
