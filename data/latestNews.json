    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/matic-analysis/polygon-matic-price-reach-2/",
    "description": "It&#8217;s been a relatively quiet period of price action for Polygon (MATIC) in the past few weeks. On this day last month, MATIC was trading around its October bottom of $0.5154 before the inflows into the crypto market.  Although the cryptocurrency has performed reasonably well and has increased by 82% since then, its rise has mostly been overshadowed by inflows into Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana, which has seen an 188% increase in the same period. After briefly falling below $0.9 many times this week due to consolidations, MATIC has now blasted off minor support at the $0.91 level. On-chain metrics like transaction count addresses making a profit and open interest on futures contracts all point to a continued surge for MATIC.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders? Polygon Network Metrics Explode Data from various market analytics platforms have shown a spike in transactions on the polygon network. Cryptoquant puts the total transaction count at its highest levels since September. At the same time, data from IntoTheBlock shows that large transaction volume (transactions of over $100,000) reached $636 million in the past 24 hours, an increase of more than 387% from yesterday. According to the analytics website, this is a surge of more than 3,800% compared to 30 days ago. The volume of MATIC futures trading has also increased in the past week, as shown by the amount of open interest. According to chart data from Coinalyze, open interest on various MATIC futures markets has jumped by 120% this month.  As shown by the chart below, the total open interest is now at $260 million from $118 million on November 1. This dramatic increase shows that more traders are betting on MATIC’s price rising significantly in the future. Source: IntoTheBlock MATIC currently has one of the highest percentages of addresses who bought around the current price in profit. Data from IntoTheBlock&#8217;s &#8220;In/Out of the Money Around Price&#8221; metric show that 71.23% of MATIC addresses that bought between $0.800122 and $1.08 are making a profit at the moment. In comparison, around 66.99% of Bitcoin addresses who bought around the current price are making a profit. Source: IntoTheBlock MATIC Price To Reach $2? Technical analysis of MATIC’s price chart shows the token could be gearing up for over $1 or higher in the coming weeks. MATIC has already bounced off a support level around $0.86 more than four times this week, indicating that the bulls are not willing to give up momentum yet.  Related Reading: ‘Vitalik Slept On My Couch &#38; Copied My Inventions’ Ethereum Insider Says MATIC is trading at $0.94 at the time of writing, and the next resistance is around a bearish order block proving resistant at $9.8. A break over this resistance could see MATIC reach above $1, and a move above $1 would confirm the uptrend and open the door for a run toward $2 or higher. According to Dave The Wave, Polygon is set to enter an uptrend against Bitcoin. The crypto analyst&#8217;s technical analysis points to a 200% increase from its current value to approximately 0.0000618 BTC, equivalent to $2.25.
