The country has a history with inflation, and I see that interest rates are going to be down next year for sure, and we're going to have another cycle,\" states Ribeiro.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/81df76c2-6224-45ba-a6cc-8bbbb38ca98c.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cointelegraph team is on the ground covering the latest frWeb Summit 2023. Source: Joe Hall</em></figcaption></figure><p>The benchmark interest rate in Brazil is currently 12.25%, down from 12.75%, and may reach 9.25% by December 2024, according to a recent survey by the local central bank.</p><p>Alongside a perspective of lower interest rates in Brazil, global drivers, such as the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States and the Bitcoin halving, are expected to affect prices. However, the crypto community should focus on fundamentals rather than price movements, according to Ribeiro.</p><blockquote>\"People just hear about Bitcoin when the price is hitting all-time highs, right? [...] but people don't talk too much about fundamentals, and the fundamentals haven't changed since its creation.\"</blockquote><p>In addition, Ribeiro emphasized the importance of regulatory frameworks in boosting innovation in the country. \"We are very advanced in terms of forms to comply with the tax authorities,\" said Ribeiro, referring to the monthly reports filed with the local tax authorities on transactions carried out on the exchanges.</p><p>According to Coinext CEO, Brazilian regulators are willing to engage in discussions about crypto and payments.</p><blockquote>\"They (Brazil's regulators) understand about crypto, they understand about the risks of our business, which is good. I won't say that regulation is good, but regulation is needed somehow because we definitely want some rules to be competitive in the market because we are competing with companies outside Brazil, which are not paying taxes, so we are not competing in the same manner.\"</blockquote><p>In the past few years, the Brazilian central bank has implemented the PIX payment system, which allows instant payments between individuals and businesses. For PIX transactions, users just need the key identifier of the PIX recipient, such as an ID number, a cell phone number or even an email address. </p><p>The country is also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-cbdc-drex-official-name-and-logo\">working on its central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC), dubbed DREX, which is expected to be available next year. \"That's going to put Brazil on another level in terms of Blockchain adoption, in terms of using Blockchain as infrastructure for the whole financial market industry,\" Ribeiro noted. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-zero-knowledge-voting-finance/\"><strong><em>Beyond crypto — Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "The king of the memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE), has been following the general sentiment in the crypto market as it breaks out from a critical level. The token experienced selling pressure on low timeframes but seems poised for further profits. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Chart Described As ‘Beautiful’ By Crypto Analyst As of this writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.078 with a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the memecoin held 6% in profits, operating as a top performer in the top 10 by market capitalization. Dogecoin On Route For $0.10? Analyst Makes Bullish Case As mentioned, the Dogecoin rally has found hurdles over today’s trading session, with the price returning below the critical level at $0.08. Crypto trader Rekt Capital claims that the recent price action confirmed a bullish trajectory for the token. The chart below shows that Dogecoin completed a path from its yearly lows at $0.052 across October and November. As the bulls pushed upwards, the cryptocurrency broke its descending channel, setting a path towards the area above $0.11, last seen in 2022. DOGE Price Likely To Return To All-Time High A separate report from another crypto trader looks at Dogecoin over high timeframes. The token is close to completing a bigger breakout over its Bitcoin (BTC) trading pair on this horizon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders? The analyst cites a series of positive fundamentals for Dogecoin, including its scalability and “low energy consumption” transactions. On the chart above and pointing to the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, the analyst stated: In the $DOGE / $BTC trading pair, bullish patterns and indicators have been observed in the higher timeframes. Notably, a falling wedge pattern is evident in the 4-day timeframe, accompanied by a bullish crossover in the MACD indicator. It remains to be seen if DOGE can return to its 2022 and 2021 high against its Bitcoin and USDT trading pairs. The bullish momentum in the crypto market is holding, albeit with an increase in selling pressure, possibly triggered by speculators taking profit at current levels.
