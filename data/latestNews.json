Lenders buy these bonds to earn a fixed income. Traders can trade these bonds in the secondary market,” the developers wrote in an introductory thread.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/opnx.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21385\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/opnx.jpg 500w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/opnx-237x300.jpg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure><p>Almost one year later, 3AC is still undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, but it appears that clawing money back has become harder than ever.

By late-June, that number had (apparently) risen to $34.1 million. Following the traction was a near 200% rise in the price of OPNX’s native OX tokens to $0.03 in the past month, pushing its fully diluted market cap to nearly $300 million.Heck, the firm even has its own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1672445851397152770\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >stablecoin</a> now. </p><p>Let’s face it, nobody, perhaps not even Davies or Zhu themselves, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/zhu-sus-exchange-did-13-64-in-volume-akshually-huobi-in-crisis-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >expected OPNX to succeed</a> from the get go. But successful underdogs often have a deep grudge against those who “punched down” the hardest while they were out on their luck. Which may be why on June 22, OPNX filed a defamation lawsuit against venture capitalist Mike Dudas, alleging the publication of defamatory comments against the exchange from February to March 2023.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OPNX-2.jpg\" alt=\"opnx\" class=\"wp-image-21384\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OPNX-2.jpg 500w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OPNX-2-242x300.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure><p>Around the same time, the exchange <a href=\"https://ox.opnx.com/justice_tokens.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >unveiled</a> its new “Justice Tokens,” (JT), citing “one of the biggest challenges the industry faces is the current prevalence of defamation,” Based on its tokenomics, one JT will exist for each defamation case, it will be an ERC20 token with a maximum supply of 1 billion. Three quarters will be distributed to OX stakers, 20% will be given to JT-OX liquidity providers, and 5% will be airdropped to Milady nonfungible tokens holders. At the time of publication, it’s unclear if Davies plans to issue tokens to build rapport against <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/3ac-cooks-up-a-storm-bitcoin-miner-surges-360-bruce-lee-nfts-dive-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >review bombers of his Dubai restaurant</a> during possible litigation proceedings.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The resulting defamation and harassment greatly deters entrepreneurs and innovators.
