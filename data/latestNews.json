    "description": "The price of Avalanche&#8217;s AVAX token has dipped over 3% in the past week, bucking the bullish trend in the broader cryptocurrency market. This comes amidst a $365 million unlocking event that increased the token&#8217;s circulating supply by 2.6%. Experts suggest both short-term challenges and long-term opportunities for AVAX. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Run: Analyst Eyes $4,500 After ETH Breached $3K Unlocking Event Triggers AVAX Price Dip On February 15th, a significant unlocking event saw 9.5 million AVAX tokens, worth roughly $365 million, released from a vesting period. This influx of previously locked-up tokens coincided with a price decline for AVAX, which fell from $40.32 to its current price or nearly $37. This aligns with historical trends, as a 2023 report by The Tie found that large unlocking events often lead to price drops within two weeks due to supply outpacing demand. AVAX price in the red. Source: Coingecko Analyst Opinions Diverge Despite the recent dip, some analysts remain optimistic about AVAX&#8217;s future. The Tie&#8217;s report, while acknowledging the short-term price pressure, highlights the Avalanche network&#8217;s growing activity, fueled by popular NFT collections like Dreamheadz and Dokyoworld. The increased engagement within the NFT space is seen as a positive indicator for long-term adoption and potential price appreciation.

This suggests some resilience in the face of the unlocking event and potential buying pressure despite the overall price dip. Some analysts even predict a possible climb to the $40 mark by the end of February, although this remains speculative. Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at $36.95. Chart: TradingView.com Market Sentiment And Broader Trends It&#8217;s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and AVAX&#8217;s price will be influenced by various factors beyond the unlocking event. The overall market sentiment, regulatory changes, and broader economic trends can all play a significant role. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. AVAX price retreating today. Source: Coingecko The recent unlocking event has undoubtedly impacted AVAX&#8217;s price in the short term. However, analysts remain divided on the token&#8217;s future trajectory. While some anticipate further price declines due to the increased supply, others highlight positive developments like the network&#8217;s growing NFT activity and potential for a rebound.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-tumbles-amid-vaneck-etfs-volume-surge-what-happend/",
    "description": "Bitcoin experienced a tumultuous day yesterday, with its price briefly touching $53,000 before plummeting to a low of $50,820. Amid this price volatility, an unexpected phenomenon caught the eye of market analysts: a dramatic surge in trading volumes for certain Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas provided a detailed account of this anomaly on X, particularly focusing on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) and its astonishing increase in trading volume. He remarked, &#8220;HODL is going wild today with $258m in volume already, a 14x jump over its daily average, and it&#8217;s not one big investor&#8230; but rather 32,000 individual trades, which is 60x its avg.&#8221; This level of activity was not only unexpected but also unprecedented, sparking widespread speculation and analysis within the financial community. The unusual trading volume wasn&#8217;t isolated to HODL alone. Wisdom Tree’s Bitcoin ETF (BTCW) and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) also saw significant upticks in trading activity, albeit to varying degrees. Related Reading: The Bitcoin “Big Money Algos” Are Here: Will BTC Breach $70,000? Balchunas pointed out, &#8220;BTCW also popping off, $154m trades, 12x its avg and 25x its assets via 23,000 indiv trades.&#8221; However, he noted that the volume increase in IBIT, while elevated, did not reach the &#8220;extraordinary levels&#8221; observed in HODL and BTCW. What&#8217;s Behind The Sudden Spike In Bitcoin ETF Volumes? Addressing theories that the ETF volume surge was driving Bitcoin&#8217;s price drop, Balchunas offered a rebuttal, &#8220;To the &#8216;bruh volume must be selling bc btc is dumping&#8217; crowd: a) that makes no sense given how little these ETFs had in existing aum/shareholders b) plus you never see ton of outflows in brand new ETF that is in rally mode c) there are so many other holders of btc besides ETFs! d) how can you call it &#8216;dumping&#8217; when it is down 1% after 20% rally in two weeks?&#8221; Related Reading: Finance Expert Predicts Bitcoin Will Touch $100,000 Soon, Here’s When However, the source of this sudden and explosive increase in trading volume remains a mystery, with Balchunas speculating, &#8220;Still haven&#8217;t figured out what happened. No one knows. Given how sudden and explosive the increase in number of trades was&#8230; I&#8217;m wondering if some Reddit or TikTok influencer type recommended them to their followers. Feels retail army-ish.&#8221; He also considered the possibility of market makers trading among each other but found it an unlikely explanation given the liquidity of other Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and BITO. The trading day concluded with &#8220;The Nine&#8221; achieving a record-breaking volume day, thanks to significant contributions from HODL, BTCW, and BITB, which all shattered their previous records. Balchunas highlighted the significance of this trading volume, stating, &#8220;For context $2b in trading would put them in Top 10ish among ETFs and Top 20ish among stocks. It&#8217;s a lot.&#8221; As the dust settles on this unprecedented day of trading, the Bitcoin community continues to grapple with the implications of this volume surge on Bitcoin ETFs and its potential impact on the market. The exact catalyst behind this phenomenon remains elusive, with analysts and investors alike keenly awaiting further developments. At the time of going to press, BTC fell below the $51,000 mark again and initially found support at the EMA100 on the 1-hour chart. Featured image created with DALL·E , chart from TradingView.com"
