Source: Gemini</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to Cointelegraph, Trezor Bitcoin analyst Josef Teteka said the move will only serve to limit the options for those looking to self custody their crypto.</p><p>“The forthcoming restrictions from Gemini UK will make it much harder for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency users to move their assets into self custody,” said Tetek, noting that the requirements include providing one’s name, name of beneficiary and in some cases, their address.</p><blockquote>“This goes against the fundamental principles of Bitcoin, where the user rightly enjoys freedom, privacy where required, and ultimately self-sovereignty.”</blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is dog <br>Email just received from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gemini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Gemini</a> <br>“Travel Rule: Changes to crypto transfer requirements for UK customers”<br><br>global hub for cryptoassets my a**, Rishi!<br><br>(I barely use Gemini Anyways but still ‍♂️) <a href=\"https://t.co/tuqhSLyZgg\">pic.twitter.com/tuqhSLyZgg</a></p>&mdash; Robin Nakamoto (@RobinNakamoto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinNakamoto/status/1720588424598433846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Gemini said its UK restrictions will also apply to incoming transfers from non-TRUST VASPs starting in December, with Gemini stating it may freeze or limit accounts attempting to make inbound transfers.</p><p>Tetek said the case at hand represents a “worrying creep towards over-regulation” which could result in the “control of its everyday citizens and the choices they make” around how they save, spend and transfer their assets. He added:</p><blockquote>“As we’ve seen again and again, crypto exchanges can and do assume control and ownership of their user’s digital assets, a situation that can end in disaster. Why should they now also be the arbiters of transactional freedom?”</blockquote><p>Several X (formerly Twitter) also expressed negative sentiment on the recent Gemini announcement. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Many people have the misconception that the only way to acquire Bitcoin is by buying it on exchanges.
