The letter warned that the app will be removed from the platform because of the “Zaps” feature that allows people to tip users and content creators in Bitcoin. The Bitcoin tipping feature was made possible through the integration of the Lighting Network widget to make Bitcoin payments and tips directly on the platform.</p><p>The Apple team in its warning claimed that the Zaps feature violates their policy that prohibits any other form of tipping feature other than in-app purchases. The tech giant claimed even though the tipping feature may be optional, “if they are connected to or associated with receiving digital content, they must use in-app purchase in accordance with guideline 3.1.1.\"</p><p>The Damus team called it a watershed moment with huge implications for platforms with peer-to-peer support. The team also clarified that Damus doesn’t sell any digital goods or provide features for selling digital goods. It simply has tip buttons for facilitating p2p transactions like Venmo or Cashapp.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Damus will be removed from the app store in 14 days, apple says zaps are not allowed on their platform because they *could* be used by content creators to sell digital content.
