    "description": "Solana, the blockchain platform launched in 2020, has achieved a significant milestone, trailing Ethereum in 24-hour decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. This historic accomplishment has garnered widespread attention from crypto leaders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a notable shift in the dynamics of decentralized finance (DeFi). As the news reverberates through the crypto space, additional elements of Solana&#8217;s success come to light. The celebration extends beyond DEX volume triumphs, with the entire Saga Mobile inventory selling out. This unexpected surge in demand underscores the growing popularity of Solana-based projects. Furthermore, the meme coin BONK, associated with the ecosystem, has broken multiple records, adding a touch of exuberance to the community&#8217;s festivities.

The data shows that Ethereum has accumulated $945 million in a single day, whereas Solana has had an astounding surge of $940 million, in second spot. As of this writing, Solana&#8217;s weekly change was 37.10%, whereas Ethereum had a decrease of more than 4%. SOL new record trading volume. Source: DefiLlama Solana has been growing at an impressive rate this year; earlier this month, it overtook Ethereum in the NFT sales figure. The digital currency achieved this run at a time when its future appeared unstable after the implosion of FTX and the attendant SOL sell-offs, while having the biggest growth margin among the top 15 cryptocurrencies year-to-date.
