Inference is when the model is used to generate content or make predictions and is constantly running. </p><p>Huang said “pretty much any” large language model (LLM) can be run through this chip and it will “inference like crazy.”</p><blockquote>“The inference cost of large language models will drop significantly.”</blockquote><p>The GH200 becomes available in the second quarter of 2024, according to Huang, and by the end of the year should be available for sampling. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-ceo-highlights-south-korean-chips-sector-for-ai-growth-willing-to-invest\"><strong><em>OpenAI CEO highlights South Korean chips sector for AI growth, investment</em></strong></a></p><p>This development comes as<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-ai-chip-value-skyrockets-amid-ai-development-boom\"> Nvidia’s market dominance</a> is currently being challenged by the emergence of new semiconductor chips from rival companies racing to create the most powerful products. </p><p>At the moment it has over an 80% market share for AI chips and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-briefly-hits-1-trillion-market-cap\">briefly tipped $1 trillion</a> in market value.</p><p>On May 28, Nvidia introduced<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-introduces-ai-supercomputer\"> a new AI supercomputer</a> for developers to be able to create successors in the style of ChatGPT, with BigTech companies like Microsoft, Meta and Google’s Alphabet expected to be among the first users. </p><p>However, on Jun 14, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) released information on its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/amd-reveals-new-a-i-chip-challenging-nvidia-s-dominance\">forthcoming AI chip</a> with the capabilities and capacity to challenge Nvidia’s dominance.
