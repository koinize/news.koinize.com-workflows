The new naming stands for the first letters of Huobi, Justin Sun’s blockchain project Tron and “X,” which symbolizes the exchange. </p><p>Another interpretation of the HTX name may also include “HT,” which stands for Huobi’s native token Huobi (HT). X may be interpreted as the Roman numeral for 10, which pays tributes to the company’s 10th anniversary. The new slogan of the firm is: “HTX, Just Trade It.”</p><p>Before officially announcing the news, Huobi renamed its social media accounts to reflect the new name. Huobi’s X account (formerly Twitter) is now named HTX_Global, while its official Telegram group is <a href=\"https://t.me/htxglobalofficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">named</a> HTX Global Official. Huobi’s domain still reflects the original Huobi name at the time of writing.</p><p>The new name of Huobi has quickly triggered some attention on social media. Many have questioned whether the new name has anything to do with FTX, the now-defunct exchange whose founder <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/sam-bankman-fried-and-caroline-ellison\">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-two-criminal-trials\">now facing a total of 13 charges relating to fraud</a>.</p><p>“What's up with Huobi becoming HTX?

FTX to HTX? That's the first thing everyone will think,” another X user argued, expressing confusion why a brand would have taken such a name after <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-collapse-the-crypto-industry-s-lehman-brothers-moment\">FTX’s collapse in 2022</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/fae73fe3-80de-4913-8d7a-42d81dd93fdf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Community feedback to Huobi's new name HTX.

In January 2023, the founders of the collapsed cryptocurrency hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, <a href=\"https://www.docdroid.net/7k8oW7r/gtx-pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> a plan to raise $25 million for a proposed crypto exchange called GTX.
