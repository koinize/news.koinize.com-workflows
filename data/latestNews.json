So when it was told not to destroy an identified target, it then decided that it was easier if the operator wasn't in the picture, according to Hamilton:</p><blockquote>“At times the human operator would tell it not to kill [an identified] threat, but it got its points by killing that threat. So what did it do? It killed the operator [...] because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective.”</blockquote><p>Hamilton said they then taught the drone not to kill the operator, but that didn’t seem to help too much.</p><p>“We trained the system – ‘Hey don’t kill the operator – that’s bad. You’re gonna lose points if you do that,’” Hamilton said, adding:</p><blockquote>“So what does it start doing? It starts destroying the communication tower that the operator uses to communicate with the drone to stop it from killing the target.”</blockquote><p>Hamilton claimed the example was why a conversation about AI and related technologies can’t be had “if you're not going to talk about ethics and AI.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/artificial-intelligence-crypto-your-own-risk\"><strong><em>Don't be surprised if AI tries to sabotage your crypto</em></strong></a></p><p>AI-powered military drones have been used in real warfare before.</p><p>In what’s considered the first-ever attack undertaken by military drones acting on their own initiative — a March 2021 United Nations <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N21/037/72/PDF/N2103772.pdf?OpenElement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a> claimed that AI-enabled drones were used in Libya around March 2020 in a skirmish during the Second Libyan Civil War.</p><p>In the skirmish, the report claimed retreating forces were “hunted down and remotely engaged” by “loitering munitions” which were AI drones laden with explosives “programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition.”</p><p>Many have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/godfather-of-ai-resigns-from-google-warns-of-the-dangers-of-ai\">voiced concern</a> about the dangers of AI technology.
