    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-doge-price-reach-0-2/",
    "description": "The Dogecoin price action has had quite a disinteresting year than most would expect from the biggest meme coin. Despite currently being up around 77% from its bear market lows of $0.053 in June 2022, the crypto has lagged compared to top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana so far in 2023.  On the bright side, DOGE’s on-chain metrics have exploded recently, pointing to a potential rebound on the horizon which could see Dogecoin spike to new highs. Dogecoin Market Overview DOGE has grown exponentially from its first days as the only meme coin in the crypto industry to now being the 10th-largest crypto asset in terms of market cap. According to Galaxy Digital, DOGE is worth almost two times as much as Wyndham Hotels &#38; Resorts and almost as much as Nissan with its current market cap of $13 billion. However, Dogecoin had a rough 2023, underperforming compared to the major cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: VeChain (VET) Set To Explode: Analyst Predicts 7,500% Rally To $2.3 At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.09109, 87% down from its all-time high of $0.7315. DOGE is now 940 days into its current bear market, 217 days less than the historical average. According to a report from Galaxy, this extended bear run has only happened twice in DOGE&#8217;s lifetime.  In the last two cycles, the meme coin went on 1,192 days and 1,117 days of depressive price action, reaching more than 85% below previous all-time highs.  Source: Galaxy Digital Although DOGE is now trading 543 days above its 2022 low, it is still underperforming in comparison to the last two cycles. In the first cycle, it took DOGE 977 days to climb to reach its all-time high from the 2015 low. Similarly, it took only 423 days to jump from its 2020 lows to the current all-time high.  DOGE price succumbs to bear pressure &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com What’s Next For DOGE? Things started to change in the middle of October 2023, as the wider crypto market entered into a bullish sentiment. The crypto has been on a run since then, recently pushing its price over $0.1 for the first time this year to register a yearly high of $0.1018.  Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Faces Crucial Turning Point That Could Trigger 50% Rally, Analyst Says This growth can also be attributed to Doginals (DRC-20 tokens), Dogecoin&#8217;s equivalent of BRC-20 tokens. These Doginals have grown massively since their launch in May, with a cumulative market cap of $100 million. At the same time, Dogecoin has seen a massive influx of new and active users, something it lacked for the majority of the year. Over 282,000 non-zero balance addresses were added in the past 30 days, while holders are bearing down. Dogecoin has now retraced from above the $0.1 mark and is now trading at $0.09109. If these metrics continue their upward trend into 2024, DOGE could see a price turnaround to break above the $0.1 level and push to $0.2 for the first time since 2021. According to data from IntoTheBlock, there are 235,150 addresses waiting to make a profit at around the $0.1 price level.
