    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fomo-spiked-green-signal-rally/",
    "description": "Data shows social media users aren&#8217;t yet showing FOMO around Bitcoin, a sign that the current rally could still have the potential to continue. Bitcoin Social Volume Hasn&#8217;t Been Too High Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the crowd FOMO that may be associated with a rally like BTC has seen recently hasn&#8217;t yet cropped up on social media. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;Social Volume,&#8221; which keeps track of the total amount of discussion any given topic or term is receiving on the major social media platforms right now. The metric measures this by counting up the posts/threads/messages that are making at least one mention of the given term. The reason it tracks the number of posts themselves rather than the mentions is so that a few threads with a significant number of mentions can&#8217;t skew the indicator by themselves. Related Reading: Solana, Chainlink Among Coins With Overheating Open Interest: Data When a topic truly receives widespread attention on social media, a large number of posts crop up as users across the platforms participate in talks. Mentions, on the other hand, can sometimes spike just because some niche circles decide to discuss the term. As such, measuring Social Volume through posts is what provides a better representation of the general trend being followed. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for terms related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency: The value of the metric seems to have been subdued in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Social Volume hasn&#8217;t been too out of the ordinary recently, despite the sharp rally that the asset&#8217;s price has witnessed. Generally, the indicator tends to rise as rapid moves in the cryptocurrency take place since users get spurred to talk more about the coin. When discussions rise too high, though, it&#8217;s often a sign that FOMO is increasing in the sector. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move against the expectations of the majority, so such a rise in FOMO has often resulted in top formations for the asset. When discussions rise alongside a drawdown instead (that is, a signal that FUD is going up), a bottom rather takes place for the coin. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that last month, the indicator registered a spike around the time of the spot ETF approvals, which coincided with the top, but such FOMO hasn&#8217;t reappeared for the coin yet. &#8220;Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s +74% price rise in 4 months, the crowd FOMO that would normally be associated with this kind of surge has not been present,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks $2,900, But Watch Out For Futures Overheating &#8220;There was certainly an interest in BTC in the weeks directly before and after the SEC&#8217;s approval of 11 ETF&#8217;s, but the lack of new greed in the space can actually be considered a promising sign that this rally can continue,&#8221; explains Santiment. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen some pullback in the past day as its price has slipped under the $51,000 level. Looks like the price of the asset has gone down over the past day &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com"
