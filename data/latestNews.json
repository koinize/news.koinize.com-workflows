More importantly, the annual core CPI model which measures all items minus food and energy showed more positive data. August annual core CPI came in at 4.3%, less than the previous month’s jump of 4.5%. </p><p>The potential that inflation may reach the United States Federal Reserve’s 2% targets is providing hope that interest rate increases will pause at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Sep. 20, an outcome that investors believe benefits risk-assets like Bitcoin. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-ogs-experts-how-to-protect-your-crypto/\"><strong><em>How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in</em></strong></a></p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CME</a> Group, a derivatives marketplace with a global benchmark product that estimates interest rates, shows a high probability that the Fed will pause interest rate increases.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/6bc09f37-1b7f-47db-b11c-703699f54112.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Interest rate probabilities.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-seeing-dark-clouds-trader-predicts-steady-bottom-formation/",
    "description": "Solana (SOL) has been making positive noise recently with a surge in its price. However, one crypto strategist known as Altcoin Sherpa on the social media platform X, believes that the euphoria may be short-lived.  Despite last week&#8217;s notable rally, Altcoin Sherpa argues that Solana is still trapped in a downtrend, casting doubts on the sustainability of its current momentum. Altcoin Sherpa points out a critical resistance level at approximately $19.50 that Solana must overcome to change its trajectory. The crypto analyst highlights a concerning pattern: Solana has been consistently forming lower highs since reaching its 2023 peak of $32.30 back in July. This pattern suggests that each attempted rally has been met with increasing selling pressure, raising questions about the strength of the recent recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Outlook: Could We See A 10% Dip Due To Supply Pressure? Altcoin Sherpa advises caution for those considering entering the market, stating: &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to see some recovery, but every rally in the last few weeks has resulted in just a lower high. Regardless, if you&#8217;re in it for an investment, it can&#8217;t be bad to accumulate sub-$20.&#8221; Currently, Solana is trading at $19.12, according to CoinGecko, showing a modest 1.1% gain in the last 24 hours and a seven-day rally of 4.5%. Solana Support Hinges On FTX Liquidation In the event that SOL&#8217;s latest rally loses steam, Altcoin Sherpa identifies the $14 level as a potential support zone. However, he underscores a crucial factor that could influence Solana&#8217;s fate in the short term—the imminent liquidation of a massive Solana stash held by the troubled crypto exchange FTX, amounting to a staggering $1.16 billion. The outcome of this liquidation could significantly impact Solana&#8217;s price stability. SOL market cap currently at $8.08 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Supporting Altcoin Sherpa&#8217;s bearish outlook is an analysis of key technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a decline in momentum, hinting at a potential downturn for Solana. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has ventured into the negative territory, providing additional validation for the bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Toncoin Shatters Bearish Predictions With 40% Rally – What’s The Story? If selling pressure continues to intensify, Solana&#8217;s price could test the psychological level of $18.00, hovering around the midline of its current trading channel. In a more dire scenario, SOL could plunge even further to reach the lower boundary of the channel at $17.29. The quantity of long positions that have already been liquidated is 45 times that of short positions, according to the liquidation statistics provided by CoinGlass. Source: Coinglass Potential Turning Point However, there is a glimmer of hope for Solana investors. In the worst-case scenario, if the downtrend persists, Solana&#8217;s price could eventually find support in the demand zone, marked by the last candlestick before the remarkable July uptrend began. This area tends to attract buyers and might serve as a potential turning point for SOL&#8217;s fortunes. While Solana&#8217;s recent rally has generated excitement, caution is advised, as technical indicators and market dynamics point towards a possible continuation of the downtrend. The crypto world remains as unpredictable as ever, and investors should carefully consider their options before diving in. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.
