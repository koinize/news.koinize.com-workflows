There are regular ferry services across the Baltic  including to Estonias capital of Tallinn, which can be reached in two hours by sea, and there are also plans to link the cities via an undersea tunnel. The nearby Helsinki-Vantaa airport is the countrys main international gateway and serves as a transfer hub for Asia.</p><p>Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world for six consecutive years by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >World Happiness Report</a>. Its income tax rate tops out at 56%  one of the highest in the world  and the tax data of every resident is public. Helsinki played host to the 1952 Summer Olympics. The country joined the European Union in 1995 and adopted the euro as its currency in 1999. In 2023, Finland became a member of NATO.</p><p>As the capital, Helsinkis crypto events draw participants from across the country, making it the natural meeting place for the industry. For that reason, projects and companies from nearby cities like Tampere and Turku are also included here.</p><p>The area was first settled around 5,000 BC as the ice age retreated. Vikings raided the established settlements, as did Swedish crusaders in the 10th and 13th centuries. The city was formally established in 1550 as a Swedish trading post, defended by Suomenlinna (Finland’s fortress), the largest sea fort in Europe. Later, under Russian control as the Grand Duchy of Finland, the emperor moved the capital from Turku to Helsinki, which was closer to St. Petersburg. Finland became independent in 1917, after which it resisted Soviet occupation in the 1940 Winter War.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Finnish-Parliament.jpg\" alt=\"The Finnish Parliament\" class=\"wp-image-24796\" width=\"760\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Finnish-Parliament.jpg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Finnish-Parliament-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Finnish Parliament.

It occurred before the much better-known May 22, 2010, “Pizza Day,” when Bitcoin was first used to purchase a physical good. Eventually, Malmi used most of his Bitcoins to purchase a studio in the metro area. If he’d hung on to them, they’d be worth $171 million today. The Bitcoin was used to seed an exchange called New Liberty Standard, which established <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-bitcoin-factbox-idUKKCN1N50GE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >the first BTC price</a> of 1,309.03 Bitcoin for $1.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Found the first known bitcoin to USD transaction from my email backups.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds began working on what became Linux at the University of Helsinki. It is also home to many video game companies, with local firm Rovios Angry Birds achieving global fame in 2009. Helsinki is also the home of Aave<strong> </strong>founder Stani Kulechov, though he has moved abroad with the company.</p><p>In 2019, a then-staunchly Bitcoin maximalist group called Konsensus organized the translation of Saifedean Ammous 2018 book <em>The Bitcoin Standard</em> into Finnish, and later also translated <a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Bitcoin-Book-Matters-Finances/dp/1641990503/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1697322469&refinements=p_27%3ABitcoin+Collective&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Bitcoin+Collective\"><em>The Little Bitcoin Book</em></a> by The Bitcoin Collective. According to one member, the organization has since become more accepting of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain use cases.</p><p>The crypto community in Helsinki and Finland is somewhat disorganized and divided, with many enthusiasts being interested in one facet  be it Bitcoin, NFTs, or Web3  without embracing the whole, and thus having few common threads.
