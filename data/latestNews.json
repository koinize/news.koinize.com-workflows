But while the derivatives market's resilience and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-26k-acceleration-binance-fears\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-26k-acceleration-binance-fears/amp\">end-of-week price gains</a> amid uncertainty in stablecoins' reserves provides hope for bulls, it might be too soon to celebrate.</p><h2>Crypto regulatory conditions deteriorate</h2><p>The past few week have seen a bearish trend fueled by regulatory uncertainty. Last week, Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a> saw 2.5% gains, but <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a> dropped 5.2%, and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) traded down 0.7%.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/e327853f-e4f7-4847-a7ac-11a2ec1cdee0.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Total crypto market cap in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice that the 10-week long pattern has tested the support level in multiple instances, signaling that bulls will have a hard time breaking from the bearish trend while regulatory conditions have worsened across the globe.</p><p>For starters, New York-based <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-delists-cardano-solana-polygon-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-delists-cardano-solana-polygon-report/amp\">derivatives exchange Bakkt is delisting</a> Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>), Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) and Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) due to recent regulatory developments in the United States. The decision follows last week's lawsuits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-up-today\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-up-today/amp\"><em>Why is the crypto market up today?</em></a></strong></p><p>More recently, on June 16, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-france-investigation-report\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-france-investigation-report/amp\">Binance has been the subject of a preliminary investigation</a> in France since February 2022. The France-based arm of the crypto exchange reportedly failed to obtain an operating license and illegally offered its services to French customers. Furthermore, the exchange lacked <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it/amp\">Know-Your-Customer</a> procedures, according to regulators.</p><p>Also on June 16, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-crypto-exchange-exits-netherlands\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-crypto-exchange-exits-netherlands/amp\">Binance announced its departure from the Netherlands</a>, with users being asked to withdraw their funds as soon as possible. The decision to exit the Dutch market occurred after the exchange failed to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.</p><p>Despite the worsening crypto regulatory environment, two derivatives metrics indicate that bulls are not yet throwing in the towel. Nevertheless, they'll likely have a hard time breaking the bearish price formation to the upside.</p><h2>Derivatives show balanced demand for BTC, ETH leverage</h2><p>Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. </p><p>A positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/0b56bdfc-abdd-4aaf-b2fd-86dcc1dd2f32.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Perpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on June 17. Source: Coinglass</em></figcaption></figure><p>The seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH is neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. </p><p>BNB was the only exception, with traders paying up to 1% per week for short bets, which can be explained by the added risks after regulatory scrutiny over the Binance exchange.</p><h2>Tether FUD hurts USDT premium</h2><p>The Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>) premium is a good gauge of China-based crypto retail trader demand. It measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer trades and the United States dollar.</p><p>Excessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 100%, and during bearish markets, Tether’s market offer is flooded, causing a 2% or higher discount.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/3f00d847-c290-42f5-bfe3-7f826c8ff72c.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Tether (USDT) peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Tether premium in Asian markets fell to 99.2% after being flat since June 6, indicating moderate discomfort. Reports on June 16 on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdt-tether-responds-to-chinese-securities-reports\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/usdt-tether-responds-to-chinese-securities-reports/amp\">Tether reserves' exposure to Chinese debt markets</a> could have been the cause.</p><h2>Potential market triggers</h2><p>Derivatives metrics displayed resilience considering the strong regulatory activity aimed at crypto exchanges. Consequently, bears are yet to prove their strength if they intend to push crypto below the $1 trillion mark.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-key-ethereum-price-metrics-point-to-growing-resistance-at-1750\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/3-key-ethereum-price-metrics-point-to-growing-resistance-at-1750/amp\">3 key Ether price metrics point to growing resistance at the $1,750 level</a></em></strong></p><p>Despite the most recent bounce from the support level, any gains above $1.12 trillion in capitalization (up 10% from the $1.02 trillion low) will likely be short-lived over the next few months.</p><p>Therefore, with the Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/160k-halving-btc-price-prediction-model-count-down-new-bitcoin-all-time-high\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/160k-halving-btc-price-prediction-model-count-down-new-bitcoin-all-time-high/amp\">halving</a> still over 300 days away, the bulls are currently pinning their hopes on a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-trust-good-or-bad-for-btc\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-trust-good-or-bad-for-btc/amp\">Bitcoin ETF approval</a> and/or a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-analyst-believes-fed-will-favor-bulls\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-analyst-believes-fed-will-favor-bulls/amp\">Federal Reserve rate cut</a> as potential bull market catalysts. </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
