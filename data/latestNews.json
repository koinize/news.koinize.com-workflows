Paradigm firmly believes that the SEC is exceeding its regulatory boundaries and further stated that it strongly opposes this tactic.</p><p>Back in June, the SEC initiated a legal action against Binance, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\">accusing them of multiple violations of securities laws</a>, such as operating without the necessary registration as an exchange, broker-dealer, or clearing agency. Paradigm also underscored that the SEC has been pursuing similar cases against various cryptocurrency exchanges lately and voiced apprehension that the SEC’s stance \"could fundamentally reshape our comprehension of securities law in several critical aspects.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/57417058-1955-4192-b516-65f30b61be56.JPG\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of Paradigm's amicus brief  Source: Paradigm</em></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Paradigm highlighted concerns regarding the shortcomings of the SEC's application of the Howey Test. The SEC often relies on the Howey Test, originating from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case involving citrus groves, as a means to determine whether transactions meet the criteria for investment contracts and, thus, fall under securities regulations.</p><p>In its amicus brief, Paradigm <a href=\"https://policy.paradigm.xyz/assets/writing/SECv.Binance-09.28.23-Paradigm-Amicus-Brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">asserted</a> that many assets are actively marketed, purchased, and traded based on their profit prospects. Nevertheless, the SEC has consistently exempted them from being classified as securities. The brief further pointed out instances such as gold, silver and fine art, underscoring that merely having the potential for value appreciation does not inherently classify their sale as a security transaction.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-buyer-in-russia-commex-silent-on-owners\"><strong><em>Binance Russia buyer tightlipped on owners, denies CZ involvement</em></strong></a></p><p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC Stablecoin, has recently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-binance-case-circle-stablecoins-not-securities\">become a participant in the ongoing legal dispute</a> between Binance and the SEC. Circle holds the view that the US SEC should not categorize stablecoins, including BUSD and USDC, as securities.</p><p>Circle contends that these assets ought not to be categorized as securities, primarily due to the fact that individuals acquiring these stablecoins do not foresee deriving profits solely from their acquisition.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-regulation-sec-chair-gary-gensler-final-say/\"><strong><em>Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
