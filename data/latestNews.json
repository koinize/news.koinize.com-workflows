The SEC has served as head of the commission since being sworn into office in April 2021, with a term expected to end in 2026. </p><p>While Davidson made serious allegations against Gensler for misconduct and abuse of power, removing an independent agency official nominated by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate is no small matter. For example, while U.S. presidents can <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2008/09/cant-be-fired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ask</a> an SEC commissioner to resign or apply subtle political pressure to do so, it’s possible they do not have the sole authority to fire one. </p><p>At least one legal expert has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/can-the-president-fire-the-sec-chairman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">claimed</a> that forcing an SEC official to leave requires some cause. A 2010 Supreme Court decision ruled that commissioners could not be removed by the President except for certain circumstances qualifying as “standard of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.” </p><p>Other officials, like Cabinet secretaries, serve “at the pleasure of the President” — i.e. they can be asked to leave at any time. Members of Congress can also expel fellow lawmakers with a two-thirds vote, though this approach is so rare it has happened only 20 times in the entirety of U.S. history. </p><p>Gensler has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorHagerty/status/1666520128589013015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">incurred</a> the increasing ire of many in the crypto space — as well as some lawmakers — over the last week following the SEC <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\">filing separate lawsuits</a> against Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The filings included several tokens the commission now considered registered securities, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-labels-61-cryptocurrencies-securities-after-binance-suit\">bringing the SEC’s total</a> to roughly 68 cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-offered-serve-advisor-to-binance-lawyers-claim\"><strong><em>SEC’s Gensler offered to serve as an adviser to Binance in 2019: Lawyers claim</em></strong></a></p><p>Davidson <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rep-davidson-to-introduce-legislation-to-fire-sec-boss-gensler-for-crypto-overreach\">proposed the anti-Gensler legislation</a> in April in response to a tweet from Coinbase legal chief officer Paul Grewal.
