The enhanced mechanism will be determined on the DSR utilization, and will be reduced over time as the DSR utilization goes up. </p><p>\"The EDSR helps fix this by ensuring that Dai holders[...] get a more fair amount of value from the increased returns generated by the protocol. In turn this might help spur adoption,\" reads the proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen. He noted that even offering increased yield, the DSR is still generating a high spread with its portfolio strategy of 75% allocated to real world assets (RWA) and 15% in custody with Coinbase. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e1e73a9e-55fd-40bd-ac64-db1663750e2f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Enhanced Dai Savings Rate (EDSR) mechanism. Source: MakerDAO.</em></figcaption></figure><p>MakerDAO raised its DSR to 3.49% in June, hoping to make DAI more competitive. The effort, however, resulted in less than 7% of the total DAI supply deposited in the DSR. \"In practice though, DSR utilization is near 0, which gives us excessive margins and a huge windfall of surplus on top of what we would naturally be earning with the protocol at this size,\" reads the proposal. \"The income we are currently earning is much greater in reality than what is even shown on e.g. makerburn.\"</p><p>The new yield seeks to boost DAI adoption amid a global slump in stablecoins market capitalization. <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According</a> to CoinMarketCap, DAI is currently in the third position among stablecoins with a $4.5 billion market cap at the time of writing, down from $8.6 billion in 2022. The DAI stablecoin sits behind Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>) and USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>), with $83.7 billion and $26.5 billion market caps, respectively. </p><p>MakerDAO has introduced several measures to keep its competitiveness amid market turbulence.
