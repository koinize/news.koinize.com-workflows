    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/robinhood/robinhood-to-lay-off-7-of-full-time-staff-in-latest-restructuring/",
    "description": "Approximately 150 employees of trading firm Robinhood Markets are slated to lose their jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Monday. This decision, which constitutes the third round of job cuts happened within a span of slightly over a year. This was stated in an internal communication by the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, Jason Warnick, and it was attributed to the need for adjustments of team structures. The 150 employees from its workforce constitute around 7% of its total staff. A Robinhood spokesperson stated: We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more. Robinhood has experienced a noticeable decline in trading activity, especially within the crypto sector. In May, the company reported a significant 30% year-on-year decrease in crypto trading revenue. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Defend Support Zone To Prepare For Another Rally Robinhood&#8217;s decline in performance could be further impacted by its decision to delist various cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Cardano. The delistings come in the wake of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s legal actions against prominent exchanges Coinbase and Binance. This layoff report also comes after Robinhood&#8217;s recent acquisition of credit card firm X1 in a deal worth $95 million. Third Round Of Workforce Reductions At Robinhood Last year, Robinhood implemented workforce reductions, reducing its headcount by 9% in April. Subsequently, in August, they conducted another round of layoffs, resulting in a significant 23% reduction of the remaining staff. These measures collectively led to a loss of over 1,000 employees for the company. During its peak in the second quarter of 2021, Robinhood witnessed remarkable success with 21.3 million active users and revenue surpassing $565 million. However, recent times have been challenging for the brokerage firm. The Q1 2023 results indicate a significant downturn, with a 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue for Robinhood. Robinhood is not the only company undergoing the effects of a less active crypto market though. Lower trading volumes across the industry have resulted in reduced profits for companies involved in facilitating crypto trades. Companies such as Robinhood, whose revenue is heavily dependent on trading volumes are always trying to adapt to the evolving market dynamics. This is to ensure the sustainability of their operations and also to stay competitive. As the market continues to evolve, brokerage firms and exchanges will likely need to reevaluate their strategies and offerings in order to attract and retain users. It may be necessary for them to explore alternative revenue streams to mitigate the impact of reduced trading volumes. The recent acquisition represents a significant milestone for Robinhood as the company endeavors to diversify its range of offerings and revenue streams.

However, it is worth noting that the stock has experienced a significant decline of over 82% from its all-time high reached in August 2021. Featured image from CNBC, chart from TradingView.com"
