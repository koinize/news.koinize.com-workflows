This cycle is led by the “King of Cryptos,” Bitcoin. </p><p>Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) is programmatically set to have a halving cycle roughly every four years, which cuts the supply of new coins awarded to miners in half. The halving sends a supply shock to the market, and as seen in the past three cycles, this under- and overvaluation in the market is partially responsible for the dramatic ups and downs.</p><p>Other factors also play critical roles in this cycle, including overall network adoption, expanded use cases for Bitcoin — like the Lightning Network for scalability and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-evolving-multi-asset-network\">Ordinals for nonfungible tokens</a> — and the ever-popular “institutional adoption.”</p><p>In 2020, Dan Held, a Bitcoin educator and marketing adviser for Trust Machines, <a href=\"https://www.theheldreport.com/p/a-bitcoin-supercycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">predicted</a> that Bitcoin would eventually see a “supercycle,” citing the increased value of the network as adoption grows (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-metcalfes-law-and-why-does-it-matter\">Metcalfe’s law</a>), increased scarcity due to the halving and increased institutional adoption.</p><p>This supercycle will, theoretically, see Bitcoin run up to new all-time highs, from which there will be no further downside, as there will be enough adoption and institutional support to continue to prop up the price.</p><h2>Crypto winter sets in at the end of 2021</h2><p>This support did not occur in the last cycle, and Bitcoin fell from its all-time high of $69,000 at the end of 2021, bringing the rest of the market down with it. All those factors of reduced supply, greater network growth, and more business and institutional support were not enough to support the meteoric rise.</p><p>Institutional support was growing so much during the last leg of the cycle that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved around the world. The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debut-canadian-bitcoin-etf-nears-100-million-in-volume-in-first-few-hours-of-trading\">first physically-backed BTC ETF</a> was launched in Canada in February 2021 by Purpose Investments. </p><p>Since then, Canada has also approved the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-etf-to-launch-this-week-as-exec-eyes-compelling-opportunities\">CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/evolve-wins-second-canadian-bitcoin-etf-as-ontario-regulator-approves-application\">Evolve Bitcoin ETF</a>. In Germany, there is the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETF, while Brazil and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-new-crypto-etfs-to-begin-trading-in-australia-this-week\">Australia</a> also launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2021 and 2022. Yet these products did not provide the institutional support many believe will come from ETFs.</p><p>However, the various stock markets worldwide do not compare to the United States.</p><p>The European Union <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-109-trillion-global-stock-market-in-one-chart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">makes up</a> 11.1% of global equity markets, while Australia and Canada make up 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. All these markets combined are dwarfed by the United States, which comprises 42.5% of all global equity markets. </p><p>This does lend some weight to the idea that this cycle may hold the promise of Held’s “Bitcoin supercycle,” as the largest country in all global equity markets may soon allow spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade.</p><p>BlackRock, one of the most prominent names in asset management and investment circles, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-apply-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-nasdaq\">applied for its own spot Bitcoin ETF</a> in June 2023, providing a kind of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-interview-charles-edwards\">green light for other intuitions</a> to start getting involved. However, institutions are only one factor here. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/49f5d899-9e72-4ad4-a198-3b36342dd079.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Adoption may be an emerging market trend </h2><p>According to Chainalysis’ recent “2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,” India, Nigeria and Vietnam <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/#top20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">were</a> the top three countries for crypto adoption in 2023. The rankings were based on an index score that looked at centralized services, retail services, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, decentralized finance (DeFi) and retail DeFi value received.</p><p>The U.S. makes up North America’s largest percentage of transaction volume, and the country ranked fourth overall. As the chart below shows, North America had the largest percentage of large institutional transfers but some of the lowest amounts of small and large retail. </p><p><strong><em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-exec-blockchain-future-societies\">Recent: Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies</a></em></strong></p><p>This differentiation is important, as the market value of a commodity is not derived from centralized entities but rather from decentralized independent actors perceiving value in the commodity. As the Chainalysis report and Cointelegraph Research’s recent <a href=\"https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/investing-in-defi-a-comprehensive-guide\">“Investing in DeFi” report</a> suggest, investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is akin to emerging markets investing at this stage in the adoption cycle.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/2c45f60a-8021-42c5-8005-f5788608ba76.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Participants, not institutions, bring value</h2><p>While institutional adoption will undoubtedly be an essential factor if and when the Bitcoin supercycle takes hold, Bitcoin itself needs to have perceived value from market participants, or it will not have the staying power. History is replete with examples of thriving industries that were superseded by a new technology the market found helpful and that toppled giants practically overnight. </p><p>The introduction of petroleum products completely overturned the whaling industry in the mid-1800s. There was a vast industry and institutions behind global whaling interests with boats, trade and infrastructure. Still, no matter how much money was behind it, the market saw better use with the new products.</p><p>More recently, and closer to the technological innovation led by the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/blockchain-is-as-revolutionary-as-electricty-big-ideas-with-jason-potts/\">blockchain revolution</a>, the dot-com bubble of the mid-1990s and early 2000s saw various companies overvalued. Part of the overvaluation was based on the assumption that adoption would be more rapid than what actually happened.</p><p>Signals such as the internet browser Netscape seeing 3 million downloads in three months had investors excited about what the rest of the industry could do.</p><p>In 1995, Netscape had a successful initial public offering, backed by institutions like Morgan Stanley, which <a href=\"https://www.studocu.com/ca-es/document/universitat-ramon-llull/corporate-finance/netscape-case-hb/3897862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">pushed</a> the stock price from $14 to $28 — valuing the not-yet profitable 16-month-old company at over $1 billion. </p><p>Investors kept looking for the next Netscape among the slew of Silicon Valley companies, and money poured into the space. In economics, the very height of the boom cycle, where overvaluation is at its apex just before the bust, is called the “Minsky moment.”</p><p>The dot-com bubble’s Minsky moment came in 2002. There was a ton of investor sentiment and institutional money flowing around, but there was no underlying adoption of many of the companies that saw investments. Nothing was ultimately there to support these companies and their value.</p><p>The Nasdaq Stock Market rose dramatically between 1995 and 2000, <a href=\"https://moneymorning.com/2015/06/12/the-dot-com-crash-of-2000-2002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">peaking</a> in March 2000 at 5,048.62 before falling 76.81% to 1,139.90 in October 2002. Without customers and the actual usage of these firms’ services in the market, there was nothing to keep the overvaluation afloat.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/e86763e9-7074-4bf8-b7ce-7eefecb1efbd.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>What does this mean for Bitcoin?</h2><p>According to Chainalysis, “There’s no sugarcoating it: Worldwide grassroots crypto adoption is down.” However, as stated previously, lower-middle-income (LMI) countries — like India, Nigeria and Ukraine — have seen increased adoption. </p><p>“LMI is the only category of countries whose total grassroots adoption remains above where it was in Q3 2020, just before the most recent bull market,” its report states.</p><p>While the United States may be fourth in terms of crypto adoption, it’s not driven by P2P Bitcoin transactions, as the U.S. ranked 12th in that category.</p><p>Rather, stablecoin trading took the lion’s share of transactions, with Bitcoin generally trading less than altcoins. Bitcoin is not currently a widespread medium of exchange in America. </p><p>This is not due to Bitcoin’s lack of perceived value on the market but rather the lack of necessity for Americans to use it for payments.</p><p>LMI countries are seeing greater adoption due to high inflationary monetary issues within their respective countries, and Bitcoin, as much as it fluctuates, can be a better alternative than holding domestic currency. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/de-dollarization-is-it-really-happening\">As the world continues with the trend of dedollarization</a>, the flight to safety could be Bitcoin. </p><p>Could this happen in the United States as well? </p><p>The three major credit rating firms — Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P), Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings — have all downgraded the U.S.’ credit rating. </p><p>In August 2011,<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/sp-downgrades-us-credit-rating-from-aaa-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> </a>S&amp;P <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/sp-downgrades-us-credit-rating-from-aaa-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">lowered</a> the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">followed suit</a> in August 2023. And on<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moodys-changes-outlook-united-states-ratings-negative-2023-11-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> </a>Nov. 10, 2023, Moody’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moodys-changes-outlook-united-states-ratings-negative-2023-11-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">lowered</a> its outlook on the U.S. credit rating from “stable” to “negative,” citing growing deficits and decreased ability to pay back the national debt.</p><p>The drops in credit ratings signal decreasing confidence in the U.S. and, by extension, the standing of the U.S. dollar being the central unit of account for global settlement.</p><p>If hyperinflation starts to rear its head in the U.S., it is possible that alternatives will be used instead of holding onto cash.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/bc42ef71-7346-411e-86e5-f268ed0a0b79.jpg\"  /></figure><h2>Chances are it’s super early in this cycle</h2><p>While Held introduced the idea of a Bitcoin supercycle, he has frequently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1372533690547507200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> that people are still early in terms of getting into stacking sats. While increased institutional adoption may give Bitcoin a rise in fiat value and greater routes for investment, all the following elements must be in play for the supercycle to be in full swing:</p><p><strong>Institutional demand: </strong>Assuming BlockRock and the other financial powerhouses are granted spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the amount of investment from institutions, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals could give Bitcoin support in raising the fiat value to a certain level. Galaxy Digital, for example, predicts this will bring Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/galaxy-digital-soaring-bitcoin-price-increase-after-etf-launch\">up to around the $59,000 level</a>.</p><p><strong>Supply: </strong>The next Bitcoin halving event will occur around April 2024 at block height 840,000, and 96.9% of all the existing BTC will have been mined. This means the supply part of the supercycle equation is checked. Even if grassroots demand stays the same, this would indicate a higher fiat price. Still, as was seen in previous cycles, a price increase (“number-go-up” technology) will likely increase demand, at least in the short term, due to fear of missing out.</p><p><strong>Adoption: </strong>While some may buy Bitcoin for “number-go-up” reasons, its actual use will give it a long-term value proposition. It is yet unknown whether America’s economic and sociopolitical climate will nudge people to adopt Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, a store of wealth or a hedge against further dollar inflationary pressure.</p><h2>What are the probabilities of a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle?</h2><p>Cointelegraph asked billionaire venture capitalist and serial blockchain investor Tim Draper what he thought the possibilities were for a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle. According to him, “I think it will be the following cycle, when we can run our businesses unimpeded by regulatory uncertainty, where we can buy our food, clothing, shelter and taxes all in Bitcoin.”</p><p>Julian Liniger, CEO of Bitcoin-only exchange Relai, told Cointelegraph that the market “will see a drastic reduction in supply due to the upcoming halving, while Bitcoin ETFs and the generally increasing interest in the asset Bitcoin mean a significantly higher demand.”</p><p>Liniger added that factors like a loss of confidence in fiat currencies, increased banking oversight and the collapse of exchanges like FTX “strengthen the Bitcoin narrative.”</p><p><strong><em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-substance-abuse-traders-trading/\">Magazine: This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders</a></em></strong></p><p>“With BlackRock and other major players on board, I also think it’s not unlikely that we will see a radical 180-degree turn in the public perception of Bitcoin. Instead of a speculative asset that consumes as much electricity as entire countries, Bitcoin could soon be seen as a safe haven promoting the transition to renewable energies,” he said.</p><p>Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph that, inorder for the supercycle to happen, “The market needs ample funds to counter negative sentiments. Firstly, re-establishing easy access channels between traditional finance and the crypto market, especially after the suppression of three crypto-friendly banks. Secondly, global governments, including the U.S., must officially recognize Bitcoin assets as equal to gold and stocks. This involves removing restrictions on the trading and holding of Bitcoin for the general public. Such integration with traditional finance provides the foundation for widespread Bitcoin adoption and creates favorable conditions for the Bitcoin Superycle to materialize.”</p><p>The Bitcoin supercycle is likely not upon the world for this continued adoption cycle. There is simply too much speculation over adoption and daily usage happening globally for the asset to have no or just a soft correction to cushion the fall once the Minsky moment pops the bubble. 2028, on the other hand, may be a different story altogether.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But once President-elect Javier Milei is seated on the throne on Dec. 10, will he still have the courage to follow a winding and risky path?</p><p>Argentina carries — with its nine defaults — the title of world champion in the category of defaulting on risk. It is currently the International Monetary Fund's largest creditor, and with a credit risk assigned by Fitch Ratings as CCC — fourth from the bottom score — it needs to fundamentally change its economy.</p><p>I'm no fortune teller, but I can offer some insight into the process. Let’s start by recognizing that it is not impossible for a country to live without a central bank. Currently, there are 198 countries and 180 currencies. Ten percent of them do not use their own currency.</p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-election\">Bitcoin-friendly Javier Milei wins Argentina presidential election</a></strong></em></p><p>Another important reality is that the IMF does not have “monetary” in its name unintentionally. It likes central banks, and aArgentina’s main creditor, its opinion will be very important in the process.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a recent campaign ad, Javier Milei appears receiving the clothes of Capitan Ancap, his superhero counterpart, and destroying the argentine Central Bank with Thor&#39;s Hammer. <a href=\"https://t.co/qw1MxSDpEG\">pic.twitter.com/qw1MxSDpEG</a></p>&mdash; Crazy Ass Moments in LatAm Politics (@AssLatam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AssLatam/status/1726248549627646393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>We also have Argentina's monetary base. According to the county's latest balance sheet, that figure stands at $7.7 billion. (That's 220,000 Bitcoin, for those keeping track, and just slightly more than MicroStrategy's $6.9 billion valuation.) For comparison, the U.S. monetary base is greater than $5 trillion.</p><p>That figure suggests the challenge of replacing the monetary base will be great, but not insurmountable. One of the difficulties of exchanging currency is obtaining paper money for day-to-day activities, but we in the crypto world know that both stablecoins and Bitcoin can help a lot in this process.</p><p>It would make sense if Milei uses the blueprint established by El Salvador. That would mean first adopting the U.S. dollar, and to subsequently begin accepting Bitcoin.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/ab1514e1-1b76-4f3c-a54f-a06fb8ce63fe.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Argentina’s monetary base, 2014-2023. Source: CEICData.com and The Central Bank of Argentina</figcaption></figure><p>A currency generally requires “legal tender” status, which means that all establishments in the country are required to accept it. Milei may institute a major policy change in this regard. If he is really a liberal (the classical term for “libertarian”), he may allow the market to decide which currencies succeed.</p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/history-tells-us-strong-bull-market-hard-landing\">History tells us we’re in for a strong bull market with a hard </a>landing</strong></em></p><p>It is well known that Argentines keep a large amount of savings in dollars outside of their country. The numbers are uncertain, but it could be in the range of S100 billion to $300 billion. But what is really important is that, under the new exchange-rate rules of this new government, that money may feel comfortable returning to the country.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meet Argentina&#39;s new president Javier Milei.<br><br>When he was growing up, kids called him &quot;The Madman&quot; because of his energetic outbursts.<br><br>At the age of 18, Milei, who was a soccer player, gave up the sport to pursue a career in economics.<br><br>Milei started getting famous for debates… <a href=\"https://t.co/fK31aNFb5Q\">pic.twitter.com/fK31aNFb5Q</a></p>&mdash; Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1726417571359199480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Argentina — even during the Menem period of the 1990s — did not have a fully convertible currency. So the first thing the future government is likely to do is unify all exchange rates and decree the currency's free convertibility. If it doesn't do that, we should start to get worried.</p><p>As a final observation, it’s important to note that the central bank and the treasury are two completely different entities. It is possible for a country to work without a central bank, but it’s more difficult not to have a treasury that controls inflows (via taxes) and outputs (via public spending).</p><p>Treasuries are also the issuers of government bonds. While a country can issue bonds in foreign, it does not control the currency printer. That increases the risk of not having the currency to pay for the bonds. That means a country's debt capacity decreases, forcing it to work with a much lower level of leverage and a revenue and expenditure policy compatible with that reality.</p><p>Notably, that also forces a country to be extremely efficient with its fiscal policies. That outcome is most likely at the root of Milei’s proposal.</p><div><div style=\"background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;\"><strong>Alexandre Vasarhelyi</strong> is a partner at BLP Gestora responsible for managing cryptocurrency funds.

The flamboyant politician secured the favor of 55% of the electorate, with three million more ballots to his name than rival Sergio Massa. </p><p>Fernando Nikolić, an Argentine Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) advocate and founder of media analyst firm Bitcoin Perception, told Cointelegraph that Milei “has spoken positively about Bitcoin when asked about it in interviews,” but also pointed out that enthusiasm should be tempered by the fact that “passing any sort of law that is considered ‘Bitcoin-friendly’ is not a part of his official program.”</p><p>Nikolić added that as an advocate for free market money, Milei is also unlikely to pass any laws that would harm Bitcoin.</p><p>Iván Paz, the CEO of crypto trading platform Trading Different, took a positive view of the election results. According to Paz, Milei’s free market policy agenda is likely to reinvigorate Argentina’s flagging economy.</p><p>“Argentina will enter a cycle of accelerated economic recovery, driven by the confidence of local and foreign investors,” Paz told Cointelegraph. “The reduction of the tax burden and the legal guarantee will once again make Argentina an attractive country to project in the long term.”</p><p>Many Argentinians now look forward to sweeping reforms. Camilo Jorajuría de León, vice-president of Bitcoin Argentina, reminded the incoming president to keep his electoral promises:</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is for monetary freedom, and that was precisely one of the proposals of the president-elect. As Bitcoiners, we hope he fulfills his promise.” </blockquote><p>Milei’s first task in office will be taming the nation’s runaway inflation, which hit 143% in October. For comparison, United States inflation <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1312060/us-inflation-rate-federal-reserve-interest-rate-monthly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">peaked</a> at 9.1% in June 2022 and is now 3.2%. With the spending power of the Argentine peso in freefall, it’s little wonder that Argentinians voted for the candidate proposing to cut almost all public expenditure and big government.</p><h2>The new politics of Argentina</h2><p>Milei promises to reinvent and reinvigorate Argentina’s economy with a completely new approach. The beliefs that underpin the policy agenda of the libertarian anarcho-capitalist are likely to resonate with many in the crypto community.</p><p>His headline policies include “blowing up” the central bank to prevent money printing, ditching the peso in favor of the U.S. dollar and scrapping almost every form of welfare in the country. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-hybrid-adoption\">Can blockchain supply the guardrails to keep AI on course?</a></em></strong></p><p>The president-elect confirmed his future plan for government departments in a dramatic video circulating on social media.</p><p>“Ministry of Sports and Tourism — out!” said Milei. “Ministry of Culture — out! Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development — out!” </p><p>In the video, Milei punctuates every cut by tearing the name of the department off a whiteboard and tossing it aside. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Argentina&#39;s new president and Donald Trump fan Javier Milei has promised to radically change the country.

In a video <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/102h5fc/javier_milei_argentinian_politician_who_has_an/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccn.com%2Fnews%2Fargentina-milei-bitcoin-dollarization%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">posted</a> to Reddit’s r/bitcoin 11 months ago, Milei states his position.</p><p>“What is the point? The point is that the first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/102h5fc/javier_milei_argentinian_politician_who_has_an/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccn.com%2Fnews%2Fargentina-milei-bitcoin-dollarization%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> Milei. “It is a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax. What Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator — the private sector.” Milei adds:</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central banker scammers and to make the money private again.”</blockquote><p>The new president may praise Bitcoin as a financial instrument, but that is somewhat different from what Bitcoin advocates may wish for. Undoubtedly, there are those who hope Argentina will adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.</p><h2>What Bitcoiners think of Melei</h2><p>Cointelegraph asked Nikolić what the election of Milei means for cryptocurrency advocates.</p><p>“I don’t believe this will drastically alter the current landscape,” Nikolić said. “Argentinians have been embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many years. My hope is that, in the long term, Argentina becomes more entrepreneur-friendly, prosperous and free, helping to mend the significant cracks in the country’s foundational structure.”</p><p>Nikolić added that the “widespread adoption of Bitcoin across the nation may be slow if 50% of its citizens live below the poverty line and lack an understanding of savings concepts.”</p><p>That’s not something that can change overnight. Milei’s policy broader economic policies will need time to bed in.</p><p>As for the million-dollar question: “Will Bitcoin become legal tender in Argentina?” Nikolić suggests that legal tender certification may be marginally less important than it seems.</p><blockquote>“I’m of the view that adoption is more robust when it emerges organically from the grassroots rather than being imposed top down. I’m hopeful that Bitcoin adoption in Argentina will continue to flourish, especially as the country progresses under Milei’s leadership and its people begin to experience improved living conditions.”</blockquote><h2>The economics of Argentina</h2><p>Soaring inflation is not the only problem facing Milei in government. When the president-elect takes office on Dec. 10, he will take the reigns of a country facing a laundry list of economic challenges.</p><p>Chief among them is the fact that Argentina is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) biggest borrower. The country owes the IMF a massive $31 billion. </p><p>The body gave the president a nod and a wink as early as Monday. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, was among those <a href=\"https://x.com/KGeorgieva/status/1726502614638985309?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">congratulating</a> Milei on his electoral success. </p><p>“We look forward to working closely with him,” she added. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations to  President-elect Javier Milei <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JMilei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JMilei</a>. We look forward to working closely with him and his administration in the period ahead to develop and implement a strong plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability and strengthen inclusive growth for all Argentinians.</p>&mdash; Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KGeorgieva/status/1726502614638985309?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Economist Nicolás Litvinoff believes Milei will need to get the IMF monkey off his back as a matter of first priority.</p><p>“I think the most important thing is to regain autonomy in terms of monetary policy. On the one hand, to accumulate reserves in the central bank that are practically non-existent now,” said Litvinoff before adding that Milei must “restore the purchasing power of wages to reactivate consumption and the economy[…] but for that, you need the International Monetary Fund out of the way.”</p><h2>Who is Javier Milei?</h2><p>Milei first came to prominence as an economist, author and political commentator.</p><p>Western media outlets compare Milei to former U.S. President Donald Trump, but the similarities drawn are often shallow. Both men are populists from outside the political mainstream. Both men rode a wave of public disaffection to electoral success. Both men have unconventional hair. </p><p>Such comparisons are just as likely to obfuscate as enlighten.</p><p>Milei was born in 1970 in Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires. He was raised as a Catholic, which informs his politics to this day. While Milei is mostly socially liberal, he is opposed to both abortion and euthanasia. He supports freedom of choice on drugs, guns, prostitution and same-sex marriage.</p><p>In his youth, Milei sang in a Rolling Stones cover band. His presentation style owes much more to the rock world than to the political.</p><p>During the campaign, Milei the showman brought a chainsaw to his rallies, frequently revving it up and raising it triumphantly above his head. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-exec-blockchain-future-societies\">Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies</a></em></strong></p><p>For supporters, Milei’s chainsaw was a metaphor for the drastic cuts his administration would take to curb government spending and reign in inflation. For opponents, the chainsaw represented something else: a dangerous and cavalier individual waving around a chainsaw in public.</p><p>They dubbed him “El loco” — the crazy one — or madman. That was little matter. Milei’s message and style resonated with voters sick of the status quo, no matter how crazy he seemed to the doubters. </p><p>As for his rival Sergio Massa, the chainsaw took on a final, more ominous meaning as Milei cut him down this weekend in a very public chainsaw massacre. Now that Milei has the keys to the president’s office, the clean-up of Argentina’s broken system must begin.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-reverse-could-the-factors-to-watch/",
    "description": "These Dogecoin on-chain indicators may be the ones to watch to see if the meme coin has a chance of finding a reversal in the near future or not. Dogecoin Large Holders Have Been Growing, Old Coins Have Come Alive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how two on-chain metrics related to Dogecoin have been looking recently. The first indicator of relevance here is the number of DOGE addresses carrying at least 1 million tokens in their balances. At the current exchange rate, this converts to about $75,800, so this range would include the large investors in the market. In particular, the sharks and whales would fall inside this group. These key investors can hold some influence in the market, so their movements can be worth following. Related Reading: Chainlink Retests $14: Here’s What Will Happen If Support Holds The below chart shows how the number of Dogecoin sharks and whales has changed over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been climbing in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on X From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Dogecoin addresses carrying at least 1 million DOGE have registered some notable growth over the past month. During this period, shark and whale numbers on the network have increased by 121. This would imply there has been interest in the memecoin from the large investors recently. Interestingly, the surge in the number of these addresses has only become sharper since DOGE topped out recently, implying that the sharks and whales have been taking advantage of the lower prices and buying more. This is certainly a positive sign for a reversal in the asset&#8217;s price, as the humongous hands appear to be backing the cryptocurrency at the current levels. There has also been a signal that may not necessarily be so positive, however. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another metric, called the &#8220;age consumed,&#8221; which basically tells us about the movement occurring from the dormant tokens on the blockchain. The dormant coins belong to the &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs), who are the most resolute hands in the sector. When the age consumed metric spikes, it means that these LTHs have decided to finally break their silence. It&#8217;s hard to say about the implications of such a trend on the meme coin&#8217;s price, but a possibility that&#8217;s always on the table is that the LTHs have in fact made their moves to sell the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Reached “Euphoria” Yet? What On-Chain Data Says As is apparent from the graph, the Dogecoin age consumed has registered a huge spike recently, implying that HODLers have been on the move. This can be a sign of selling, but Santiment has pointed out that more often than not, such spikes in the indicator signal a change in direction for the asset&#8217;s price. Between these two signals, one bullish and the other perhaps a bit more mixed, it now remains to be seen how the price of DOGE develops in the coming days. DOGE Price Since hitting a top above $0.087 a few days back, Dogecoin has slipped down all the way towards $0.076. Looks like DOGE has observed some drawdown recently &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
