A committee of 6 practitioners, including co-founder of Ledger, Nicolas Bacca, and founder of the crypto exchange Paymium, Pierre Noizat, will also oversee the work of the Institute. </p><p>According to Cyril Grunspan, the director of the Cryptoassets Institute, it will focus primarily on educational goals:</p><blockquote>“Our goal is not to lobby but to create a forum for discussion on cryptoassets.”</blockquote><p>Two lectures accompanied the opening: historian Jacques Favier spoke about the history of currencies up to Bitcoin, and cryptographer David Pointcheval ruminated on zero-knowledge proofs and anonymity. The Institute is going to hold such public events regularly. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-based-ai-language-model-aims-to-drive-education\"><strong><em>Bitcoin-centric AI language model aims to drive BTC education and adoption</em></strong></a></p><p>France is actively pursuing a leadership role in Europe regarding digital economy and innovations.
