    "description": "<p>The crypto market has continued its downward trajectory over the last three weeks. The next big move is imminent.</p>\nExceptionally low volume becalms market\n<p>As bitcoin moves sideways and downward the altcoins are hit harder as usual, with around $40 billion having been wiped off of the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum.</p>\n<p>A lack of volume still besets the sector, likening this situation to a period of calm before a storm hits. Whether this storm will push the market higher or lower is still to be determined.</p>\n<p>The value of the total 3 market cap (all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum) is delicately poised at $340 billion. A further fall to $330 billion is a possibility, especially given that the upwards trend since June has been broken to the downside.&nbsp;</p>\n$XRP still coming down after recent surge\n<p>A particular altcoin, much in the news of recent times, to have been hit quite hard, is $XRP. $XRP is down 3.2% to $0.66 on the day so far, and this following a 30% descent from the high achieved on the news that $XRP wasn&rsquo;t considered a security when being bought by retail investors on exchanges.</p>\n<p>However, $XRP is just above support right now, with the 0.618 Fibonacci for this latest move just below this. If these are broken, $0.58 and $0.50 are good supports further down.</p>\n$DOGE triple bottom?\n<p>$DOGE is another one investors have their eye on. Following a 55% surge from what could be considered a triple bottom, $DOGE has since retraced to strong support at $0.073. $DOGE is trapped inside a downwards wedge since November 2022 so a break to the upside could happen in the next few months.</p>\nThe $KAS top in for now?\n<p>One of the altcoin success stories over recent months is certainly Kaspa ($KAS). This would-be successor to ethereum has bucked the trend since the latter end of May by surging over 300%. A top may be in for now, but this coin is certainly worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n$INJ bearish?&nbsp;\n<p>Injective Protocol ($INJ) is one of the biggest movers to the upside this year, rising as much as 723% since January 1. However, a break out of a bull flag saw the price hit the top at $9.90 again (double top?) and the present pattern is starting to form a potential bearish head and shoulders with the right shoulder still to form.</p>\n<p>A measured move to the downside here could see $INJ go all the way down to test the 200-day moving average which it last left behind in late January.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/lunc/price-of-lunc-will-land-this-august/",
    "description": "LUNC’s community has worked continually towards reviving the ecosystem’s native LUNC token. However, recent data from this artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm suggests these efforts might not be enough. LUNC’s Price Prediction PricePredictions, a state-of-the-art crypto analysis and forecasting platform, has projected Terra Classic (LUNC) to trade at around $0.000076 by the end of this month. PricePredictions combines indicators like average true range (ATR), relative strength index (RSI), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) to make such forecasts.  Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks Suppose this projection is anything to go by, it means LUNC will experience a decrease from its current price by August 31, 2023, with LUNC currently trading at around $0.000079, according to data from CoinGeko. While this news is undoubtedly bearish for the LUNC community, there was more to cheer about following Binance removing 1.14 billion tokens from circulation as part of the LUNC burn mechanism. LUNC’s price also surged following this news, although it has since retraced.  While the machine-learning prediction indicates a potential decline in LUNC’s price, it is important to note that the recent price spike following the Binance announcement demonstrates that positive developments can potentially reverse the trend of Terra Classic. Such events could potentially mean that we could see more uptrend from the token as the community continues to propose solutions that could see regain the confidence of investors and push its once stablecoin USTC to re-peg with the dollar. Token price sitting at $0.00007937 &#124; Source: LUNCBUSD on Tradingview.com USTC Decision Likely To Affect LUNC Vegas, a member of the LUNC community, had earlier proposed in a tweet that the $800 million USTC tokens linked to the Ozone protocol should be returned to the Terra Classic community pool because of the ineffectiveness of the project and its failure to adhere to the proposed development plan. Meanwhile, there has been a conflicting proposal from Alex Forshaw, a co-author of the Terra Classic Revival Roadmap, who has proposed that the $800 million USTC tokens be burned instead. He believes that validators and stakers who have a strong influence on the ecosystem will most likely dump their tokens, leading to a further decline in the token’s value. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six While whatever proposal the community moves forward with will affect USTC’s price with the hope that it finally reclaims its peg with the US dollar, it will most likely affect LUNC’s price too.  Currently, LUNC’s price is trending at $0.00007925, down 1.62% in the last 24 hours and 3.08% in the last 7 days. However, this downtrend could quickly reverse if the community is able to figure out a way to re-peg USTC to the US dollar. Featured image from Coin Culture, chart from Tradingview.com"
