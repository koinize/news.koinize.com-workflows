He was referring to the SEC extending the comment period for a proposed rule change in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which could have securities laws apply to decentralized exchanges in the same way they currently apply to securities exchanges. </p><p>“Requiring a DEX to register in the same way as a national securities exchange is impossible,” said Grewal. “Requiring the impossible violates the [Administrative Procedure Act]. And simply saying there is no economic data doesn’t absolve the SEC from conducting economic analysis, especially when that data exists.”</p><p>He added:</p><blockquote>“The SEC is attempting to front run Congressional action by baking unsupported assumptions about its crypto jurisdiction into the proposed rules.”</blockquote><p>Some U.S. lawmakers and crypto advocacy groups including the Blockchain Association have also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-hears-from-blockchain-assoc-house-republicans-on-exchange-definition-proposal\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sec-hears-from-blockchain-assoc-house-republicans-on-exchange-definition-proposal/amp\">criticized the SEC proposal</a>, claiming the rule change would allow the commission to exceed its authority and expand its purview to a range of financial products not equipped to handle such regulatory requirements. According to the Coinbase CLO, there was a path forward with the proposed rule change, requiring “robust consideration of the profound differences between a DEX and a traditional exchange”.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we filed a comment letter on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SECGov</a> proposed rule that seeks to expand the definition of exchange to include DEXs.
