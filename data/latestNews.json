The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/black-rock-ether-etf-eth-price-btc-etf-done-deal\">increased bullish sentiment</a> pushed Ether price up by 26.2% in 30-days. The fact that ETH trades above $2,000 could indicate that greater attention is shifting toward Ether and this renewed bullish momentum has sent ETH price to gain 69.5% year-to-date. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/d69390f6-2b51-4c2b-b9fd-210ea9a9a048.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ether price.

So far, it has not confirmed a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cathie-wood-ark-spot-bitcoin-etf-amend\">spot crypto</a> ETF.</p><p>However, the market flashed more bullish signals when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed for a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-enters-race-spot-ethereum-etf-nasdaq-filing\">spot Ether ETF</a> on Nov. 9. The confirmation sent <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-price-hits-6-month-high-amid-black-rock-spot-etf-buzz-wheres-retail-demand\">Ether price</a> over the $2,000 resistance, earning a 6-month high on the same date. BlackRock filed the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-files-s1-form-for-spot-ether-etf-with-sec\">S-1 form</a> with the SEC on Nov. 16.</p><p>Many anticipate that the SEC will first approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024. Once that happens, many crypto analysts see a spot Ether ETF approval shortly after.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/interview-2-years-after-john-mcafee-death-wife-janice-broke-still-grieving/\"><strong><em>Exclusive: 2 years after John McAfee’s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers</em></strong></a></p><p>The anticipation of approval is leading to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-institutional-inflows-1b-2023-btc-supply-squeeze\">increased institutional</a> capital inflows.

With the increase in Ether fees, the Ethereum network revenue is up 218.6% in the past 30-days, which equates to $1.94 billion annualized. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/8b41ae25-d1da-437e-a3a1-fc3ebedea5a0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ethereum network fees and revenue.
