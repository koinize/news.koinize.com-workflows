Shin is accused of defrauding investors. Also at issue was whether or not Luna is a security.</p><p>Shin left Terraform in 2020 “for business reasons,” his lawyer told the court. Shin was the CEO of Chai, a payments technology company that partnered with Kwon to form Terraform in 2019.

[…] It has nothing to do with the defendant.”</blockquote><p>The Anchor Protocol was the algorithm used to maintain the value of the dollar-pegged Terra coin. </p><p>The defendants face multiple charges under at least four laws, including the Information Act. The prosecutor claimed, “They took advantage of the fact that investors had difficulty accessing information and had a low understanding of it.”</p><p>The prosecutor also said, “A business using virtual assets as a payment method cannot be established,” but the defense lawyer disputed that statement, saying there were no regulations on using virtual assets for payment when Terraform was founded.</p><p>The prosecution referred to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple as the basis for several charges relating to violations of South Korea’s Capital Markets Act, comparing the sale of XRP to investors to the actions of Terraform in South Korea.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-to-question-terraform-labs-daniel-shin-questioning-south-korea\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sec-to-question-terraform-labs-daniel-shin-questioning-south-korea/amp\">SEC seeks to question Terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin in Korea</a></em></strong></p><p>The defense responded that American law does not apply in South Korea and, “The government has announced several times since 2017 that virtual assets do not fall under the category of financial products (securities),” adding that the Capital Markets law could not be applied retroactively in any case. </p><p>The SEC <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-do-kwon-and-terraform-labs-for-fraud\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-do-kwon-and-terraform-labs-for-fraud/amp\">sued Terraform and Kwon</a> for fraud in February. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Korean prosecutors have summoned Terra co-founder Daniel Shin to attend an investigation into insider trading, price manipulation, and breach of duty to Chai customers.

The S&P 500 Index dropped 2.53% last week and 2.39% the week before. This shows that Bitcoin has decoupled from the S&P 500 Index in the short term and may chart its own course.</p><p>However, the path higher may not be easy. The Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on Nov. 1 may cause some volatility, but it will li be short-lived as no surprises are expected.

Source: </em><a href=\"https://coin360.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>Coin360</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A large part of the gains in Bitcoin have been fuelled by expectations that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the near future. Any adverse news in this regard may prove to be a major setback for the bulls. When traders start chasing prices higher, it increases the risk of a short-term pullback. </p><p>What are the important support levels on Bitcoin and altcoins that need to hold for the sentiment to remain bullish? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.</p><h2>S&P 500 Index price analysis</h2><p>The S&P 500 Index (SPX) remains in a strong downtrend. The price is close to the strong support zone between 4,050 and 4,100.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/df65ffed-a403-4f13-8f02-368aefd1d245.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SPX daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=TVC%3ASPX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The sharp fall of the past few days pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the oversold territory, suggesting that a pullback may be possible. On the upside, the bears are expected to sell near the 20-day exponential moving average (4,255).</p><p>If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then again try to sink the price below the support zone. If they succeed, the index could plummet toward 3,800. This negative view will invalidate in the near term if the price rises and sustains above the 20-day EMA. </p><h2>U.S. dollar index price analysis</h2><p>The U.S. dollar index (DXY) rebounded off the 50-day simple moving average (105) on Oct. 24, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/10661b38-f87d-45f1-a847-c7d6593e5ffa.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DXY daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=TVC%3ADXY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The rising moving averages indicate advantage to buyers but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. That could keep the index range-bound between 105.36 and 107.35 for some time.</p><p>If buyers maintain the price above the 20-day EMA (106.23), the bulls will attempt to drive the index above 107.35. If they succeed, the index may surge toward 111. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to drag and sustain the price back below 105.36. The index may then fall to 104.50.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>After the sharp rally, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase between $33,390 and $35,380. This is a positive sign as it suggests that the bulls are in no urgency to book profits aggressively.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3332cc1a-ebf7-4a3b-b88f-4b39057aaa35.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Although the overbought levels on the RSI warrant caution, the rising moving averages suggest that bulls remain in charge. If buyers drive the price above $35,280, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $40,000. This level is likely to act as a formidable resistance.</p><p>On the way down, if bears sink the price below $33,390, the pair risks a drop to $32,400 and then to $31,000. This zone is likely to witness solid buying by the bulls because if it cracks, the selling could intensify and the pair may plummet to $28,143.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) has been maintaining above the breakout level of $1,746 but the bulls have failed to extend the recovery. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/9b2219c3-3e54-4866-bfa0-190611c99e90.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The ETH/USDT pair may stay range-bound between $1,746 and $1,865 for a few days. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that the bulls have the upper hand.</p><p>If buyers kick the price above $1,865, the pair could rally to $2,000. The bears are likely to guard this level with vigor. </p><p>The important support on the downside is $1,746 and then the 20-day EMA ($1,705). Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat if they sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) has been stuck inside a large range between $235 and $203 for the past several days. The rising 20-day EMA ($219) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have a slight edge.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/40b4efd2-88fd-44f2-b631-7167601bab75.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price sustains the rebound off $223, the bulls will again try to shove the price above the overhead resistance at $235. If they can pull it off, it will indicate the start of a sustained recovery to $250 and eventually to $265. </p><p>Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to yank the price back below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the BNB/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a while longer.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>After staying in a tight range between $0.56 and the 20-day EMA ($0.53) for the past few days, XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) cleared the hurdle on Oct. 30.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/676d53dc-d8f0-414f-9b0d-54708104bbcf.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are at an advantage. There is a minor resistance at $0.59. If bulls overcome this barrier, the XRP/USDT pair is likely to climb to $0.66.</p><p>However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it may trap several aggressive bulls. The pair may then remain stuck between $0.46 and $0.56 for a few more days.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>In an uptrend, the corrections are shallow and short-lived. That is what happened in Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>). After a minor pullback, the bulls have asserted their supremacy.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/5553b247-1240-4651-84ec-d57aa86722cd.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The SOL/USDT pair resumed its uptrend on Oct. 30 with a break above $33.90. The bulls will next try to push the price to $38.79. This level is expected to act as a major resistance but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may reach $48.</p><p>The important support to watch on the downside is $31. If the pair slips below this level, it will suggest that the bulls may be dumping their positions in a hurry. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($28,73).</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cme-second-largest-bitcoin-futures-exchange-open-interest-surges\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/cme-second-largest-bitcoin-futures-exchange-open-interest-surges/amp\"><strong><em>CME becomes second-largest Bitcoin futures exchange as open interest surges</em></strong></a></p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been sustaining above the breakout level of $0.28 for the past few days but the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the overhead hurdle at $0.30.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/bf1c72fb-89fa-4415-a2be-4484736fe3f5.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Still, a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground from the overhead resistance. This suggests that the buyers have kept up the pressure. If they overcome the roadblock at $0.30, the ADA/USDT pair could start a rally to $0.32 and thereafter to $0.34.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price turns down from $0.30, it will suggest that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The pair may then swing between $0.28 and $0.30 for some time. A break and close below the 20-day EMA ($0.27) will tilt the advantage back in favor of the bears.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $0.07 mark. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/8069d831-2da4-47d2-9273-31a373e9ba3d.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A minor positive is that the bulls are buying the dips below $0.07. This suggests that the sentiment has changed from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to overcome the obstacle at $0.07. If they can pull it off, the DOGE/USDT pair could start its northward march to $0.08.</p><p>The important support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($0.06). If this support cracks, the pair could dive to the solid support at $0.06.</p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) broke below the moving averages on Oct. 27 but the bears could not build upon the advantage. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/e4553041-74d1-4524-8737-d720bba4cbbc.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=OKX%3ATONUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA ($2.07) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. If the price rises above the moving averages, the bulls will try to kick the TON/USDT pair above $2.31. If they do that, the pair may start its journey to $2.59.</p><p>Conversely, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are trying to gain the upper hand. A break below $2 could clear the path for a decline to $1.89.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description": "A solo Bitcoin miner has struck gold after successfully claiming a $200,000 block reward. The considerable achievement has captured the attention of fellow miners and crypto enthusiasts, highlighting the potential for lone miners to effectively compete with larger mining operations  Lone Bitcoin Miner Hits Jackpot On October 28, a software engineer of Bitcoin CGMiner and an admin of Solo Ckpool, Dr. Con Kolivas congratulated a lone Bitcoin miner in an X (formerly Twitter) post for accomplishing a rare milestone by solving the 278th solo block at Solo Ckpool.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Uniswap’s UNI As The Next Coin Primed For Breakout The lucky miner used 11 PH/s of hash power to discover block 814,308 and claimed a $200,000 (6.25 BTC) block reward. “Congratulations to miner 3KCykmdpBpNKTtZJAvp3u2N2EQjGzbUF7c with ~11PH for solving the 278th solo block on solo.ckpool,” Dr. Kolivas stated.  Presently, large-scale mining operations and pools are dominating the Bitcoin mining industry. When blocks are discovered, these mining companies often share the rewards. In contrast, mining pools like Solo Ckpool offer lone miners a higher level of independence allowing them to earn almost all rewards when they discover a block.  This recent solo mining achievement has not been the only accomplishment this year. In August, a solo Bitcoin miner solved block 803,821, claiming 6.25 BTC worth $160,000. Multiple solo miners have also discovered substantial blocks and reaped significant rewards in the last few months.  The lure of solo mining pools is growing as many miners are looking to increase their chances of earning large rewards while reclaiming a sense of independence in the competitive Bitcoin mining market.  BTC Mining Hashrate On The Rise Bitcoin Hashrate has continued to increase following the recent surge in the value of BTC. Earlier on October 12, the hash rate saw an alarming increase to 456 exahash per second (EH/s). Following this increase, the hash rate stabilized slightly dropping down to 443 EH/s sometime on October 28.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Crypto Spot Trading Volumes Climb To 8-Month Highs Despite the increased level of mining difficulties, hash rates are rising. Bitcoin hash rate is slightly back up today to 452.63 EH/s with an estimated difficulty adjustment of 12.78% and network difficulty of 62.46T. The average block time for mining is also approximately 8 minutes and 52 seconds.  In the past month, mining hash prices fell to significant lows, depicting the possibility of chain validators experiencing higher mining difficulties and pressure. Now, hash rates are on the rise and Bitcoin miners are taking advantage of these opportunities to increase their earnings.
