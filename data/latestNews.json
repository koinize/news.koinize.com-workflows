Musk may have proved the OpenAI CEO’s point with his clap back.</p>\n                    <p><p>The launch of Elon Musk’s new “Grok” artificial intelligence (AI) system may not have made waves throughout the machine learning community or directly threatened the status quo, but it’s certainly drawn the attention of Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. </p><p>In a post on the social media app X, formerly Twitter, Altman compared Grok’s comedic chops to that of a grandpa, saying that it creates jokes similar to “your dad’s dad.” </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GPT-4? More like GPT-Snore! <br><br>When it comes to humor, GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine. <br><br>Humor is clearly banned at OpenAI, just like the many other subjects it censors. <br><br>That’s why it couldn&#39;t tell a joke if it had a goddamn instruction manual.

His response, which he claims was written by Grok, starts off by tapping into a comedic classic, rhyming \"GPT-4\" with the word \"snore\" before dusting off an antique “screen door on a submarine” reference.</p><p>However, in more modern fashion, Grok’s “comedy” quickly spirals into what appears to be an angry machine diatribe, remarking that humor is banned at OpenAI and adding “that’s why it couldn't tell a joke if it had a goddamn instruction manual” before stating that GPT-4 has a “stick so far up its ass that it can taste the bark!”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-launches-ai-chatbot-grok-says-it-can-outperform-chatgpt\"><strong><em>Elon Musk launches AI chatbot ‘Grok,’ says it can outperform ChatGPT</em></strong></a></p><p>As far as CEO v CEO squabbles go, this one may lack the classic nuance and <em>savoir faire </em>of the legendary Silicon Valley battles of yesteryear (Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs, for example), but what todays’ kerfuffle lacks in comedic weight or grace, it might perhaps make up for in general wierdness.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxOp5mBY9IY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><em>In the above video, a grinning Bill Gates lords over Apple’s MacWorld 1997 event in a giant screen above Steve Jobs after Microsoft’s $150 million stock purchase in the company. </em></p><p>Altman and Musk go way back. Both were co-founders at OpenAI before the latter left the company just in time to avoid getting swept up in the rocket-like momentum that's carried it to a two-billion dollar valuation.</p><p>In the wake of OpenAI's success, which has largely been attributed to the efficacy of its GPT-3 and GPT-4 LLM models, Musk joined a chorus of voices calling for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-ceo-to-testify-before-congress-alongside-ai-pause-advocate-and-ibm-exec\">a six-month pause in AI development</a> largely prompted by as-yet unfounded fears surrounding the supposed potential for chatbots to cause the extinction of the human species. </p><p>Six months later, nearly to the day, Musk and X <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">unveiled</a> a chatbot model that the CEO claims outperforms ChatGPT.</p><p> Dubbed “Grok,” Musk's version of a better chatbot is an LLM supposedly fine-tuned to generate humorous texts in the vein of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” a celebrated science fiction novel written by Douglas Adams. </p><p>Adams’ literary work is widely <a href=\"https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/douglasadams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">regarded</a> as foundational pieces in the pantheon of comedic science fiction and fantasy. His humor has been described by pundits and literary critics as clever, witty, and full of both heart and humanity.</p><p>And that brings us to GPT-4, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chat-gpt-launches-feature-subscribers-make-own-gpts\">OpenAI’s recently-launched “GPTs” feature</a> which allows users to define a personality for their ChatGPT interface, and Musk’s full-throated insistence that Grok is funnier.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@xAI</a> will release its first AI to a select group. <br><br>In some important respects, it is the best that currently exists.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1720372289378590892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>It’s currently unclear which model is more robust or capable.
