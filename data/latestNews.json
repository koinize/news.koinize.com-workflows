    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is attempting a recovery wave from the $0.4650 zone. ADA could start a fresh rally if there is a close above the $0.550 resistance. ADA price is moving higher from the $0.4650 zone. The price is trading below $0.570 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.545 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could accelerate higher if there is a clear move above $0.545 and $0.550. Cardano Price Attempts Fresh Increase After a strong rally, Cardano faced sellers near the $0.675 zone. ADA started a fresh decline below the $0.620 and $0.600 support levels, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.550 support and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Finally, the price found support near the $0.4650 zone. The price is now attempting a fresh increase above the $0.500 resistance zone. The price tested the 23.3% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6768 swing high to the $0.4650 low. ADA is now trading below $0.570 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.545 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.532 zone. The first resistance is near $0.545 and $0.550. The next key resistance might be $0.570 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6768 swing high to the $0.4650 low. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com If there is a close above the $0.570 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.650. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.545 resistance level, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.500 level. The next major support is near the $0.465 level. A downside break below the $0.465 level could open the doors for a test of $0.432. The next major support is near the $0.420 level. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level.
