    "description": "Bitcoin has set a new record by surpassing $71,000, solidifying its status as the digital counterpart to gold and overtaking the market capitalization of silver. Related Reading: Cloudy Future For Ethereum ETFs – What’s Casting Doubt On Their Fate? Bitcoin A Tad Close To $73K This achievement, occurring with remarkable frequency since early March, saw Bitcoin registering a new all-time high of $72,750 today, marking a 5% daily increase and an 12% gain over the past week. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s consistent climb underlines its relentless ascent in the financial world. Amid the UK financial regulator&#8217;s announcement that it would permit the trading of cryptocurrency-backed securities, the price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of nearly $73,000. The leading cryptocurrency erased its previous peak of nearly $69,000 set in November 2021. On Monday, the Financial Conduct Authority disclosed that it would not raise any objections to investment exchanges establishing a market segment for cryptoasset-backed exchange traded notes [cETNs], a stock-like financial instrument, on the UK list. This increase in value also occurs in the few months since the alpha crypto asset surpassed Tesla, Meta, and Berkshire Hathaway, solidifying its status as the eighth-largest asset in terms of market capitalization, which presently stands at a noteworthy $1.4 trillion. Although it is still in the shadow of industry titans such as Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, Bitcoin&#8217;s rise has been nothing short of spectacular. BTCUSD currently trading at $71,567 on the 24-hour chart at TradingView.com The FCA said it maintains its stance that cryptoassets are mainly unregulated and &#8220;high-risk investments.&#8221; and that Investors should anticipate the complete loss of their capital, the regulator said in a statement. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at the brokerage Finalto, described the FCA&#8217;s action regarding the cryptocurrency market as &#8220;positive.&#8221; In reference to steep price increases, he further stated that &#8220;parabolic&#8221; market movements tended to conclude with a significant pullback, but &#8220;we can no longer be certain with bitcoin,&#8221; he pointed out. Bitcoin ETF Frenzy: Record $2.7-B Weekly Inflows Propel Crypto Markets The surge in US spot bitcoin ETF inflows remains a key driver of cryptocurrency price dynamics, as reported by CoinShares, with record-breaking weekly inflows of $2.7 billion and a year-to-date total of $10 billion, approaching the 2021 annual record of nearly $11 billion. Simultaneously, increased leverage in the crypto market has resulted in the most significant price fluctuations in almost a year. Funding rates, reaching their highest levels since January 2021, and record-breaking bitcoin open interest contribute to the heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fee Shock: Network Charges Double Amidst Excitement Of $70,000 BTC Meanwhile, a notable catalyst propelling this bullish upswing is the forthcoming halving of Bitcoin, which NiceHash estimates will take place in around 35 days. This occurrence, which has transpired on three separate occasions prior to this one, involves a decrease in the compensation provided to Bitcoin miners for the processing of newly added blocks on the network. The incentive will decrease from 6.25 BTC to 2.125 BTC as a result of this fourth halving, further reducing the supply of new coins. Comparable to the scarcity of gold, this scarcity-driven paradigm has long been regarded as a fundamental component of Bitcoin&#8217;s value trajectory. In the same way that the scarcity of gold serves as the foundation for its value, the halving of new Bitcoin supply events strengthens Bitcoin&#8217;s allure as a store of value in the digital era.
