This numerical symbiosis underscores the sway of broader cryptocurrency trends on Dogecoin&#8217;s market movements. Despite the undulating market landscape, Dogecoin has notched up impressive transactions exceeding $100K, totaling a staggering $4.5 billion in the past week.

Chart: TradingView.com Dogecoin: Wild Ride Unfolds In the annals of cryptocurrency history, Dogecoin&#8217;s trajectory has resembled a wild ride, marked by dizzying highs and abrupt descents.
