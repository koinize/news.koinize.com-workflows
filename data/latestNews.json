That indicates continued demand for Bitcoin at every higher level. A report by on-chain data analytics firm CryptoQuant said they estimate that more than “75% of new investment into Bitcoin” <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-about-75-new-investment\">comes from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a>.</p><p>However, nothing goes up forever.

It is difficult to call a top when the momentum is strong, but every euphoric moment eventually peaks and is followed by a sharp correction.</p><p>Macroeconomic factors could act as a headwind for the market rally in the near term. On Jan. 16, CME Group’s FedWatch Tool was showing a 63% probability of a 25 basis points rate cut by the Federal Reserve in their March meeting, but that expectation has dwindled to 10.5% after the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index numbers for January <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-us-ppi-miss-52k-fed-rate-cut-odds-fall\">remained above market forecasts</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-analysis-2-16-btc-eth-sol-bnb-xrp-ada-avax-doge-link-dot\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
