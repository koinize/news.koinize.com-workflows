Users could effectively <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-new-token-lets-you-save-on-ethereum-fees-by-storing-gas\">store cheap gas</a> during periods of low network demand. </p><p>“This allowed users to mint gas tokens when fees were low, and burn them when fees were high, effectively \"locking in\" the lower fee,” explained Revoke.</p><p>However, Revoke said that scammers have been creating fake gas tokens that they airdrop with fake approvals that users think they need to revoke.</p><p>The spurious tokens have been programmed to generate a lot of gas during the revoked transaction with the newly minted gas tokens being sent back to the scammers leaving the victim with a high transaction fee. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/7d6caa00-7e56-4f69-bcb5-84a191ae0cd7.PNG\"  /></figure><p>Revoke said it has now addressed the issue by adding a check that disables revoking approvals if there's an excessive gas fee. It advised users to ignore the fake approvals: </p><blockquote>“Best thing to do with these fake approvals / fake tokens is to ignore them. As long as you don't interact with them, they can't steal your funds.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-twitter-impersonated-on-threads-by-possible-scammers\">'Scammers' pose as Crypto Twitter users on Threads as sign-ups near 100M</a></strong></em></p><p>Revoke is a preventative tool that helps users practice safer crypto wallet behavior by managing or revoking active approvals such as those no longer required by DeFi protocols. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/806b5f9f-2949-4ffe-a544-566bdb933b20.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Revoke's new fix to combat the gas token approval scam.
