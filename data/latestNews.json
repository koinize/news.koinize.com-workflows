Its utility token, Guild of Guardians Gems (GOG), went up for sale in December 2021, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-game-guild-of-guardians-raises-5-3m-token-sale-oversubscribed-82x\">raising over $5.3 million</a> for the game’s development. In addition, over 800,000 individuals registered for the token sale, which Immutable claimed was an “oversubscription” of 82 times vs. the expected demand. It is being developed by Mineloader, which is the same company that created the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Gods Unchained creator Immutable is publishing the game.</p><p><a href=\"https://portal.guildofguardians.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According</a> to the game’s roadmap, it is expected to be released in open beta sometime in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Guild of Guardians documents state that it will be a free-to-play and play-to-earn mobile game. Players will not need to make any purchases to begin playing the game and start earning nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or game tokens. To finance the game’s further development after launch, Immutable will sell “seasonal content” consisting of limited edition NFTs, including “heroes, pets, guilds and energy boosters.” They will also charge a percentage fee on secondary sales of some of the game’s items.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/11fd05b3-7539-4b7b-ae6e-4a66f6c33d9e.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Guild of Guardians demo opening screen. Source: Guild of Guardians demo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The play-to-earn aspect of Guild of Guardians will revolve around crafting equipment and summoning heroes. Players will be able to earn crafting materials as they progress through dungeons, which they’ll be able to use to mint NFTs that represent gear. They’ll also be able to collect “common” heroes that can be combined into higher rarities and minted on the blockchain. Guild of Guardians NFTs are minted on the Immutable X network, while the GOG token is on Ethereum.</p><p>Ever since the fundraise, details about the state of the game’s development have been scarce. But Immutable invited members of the media to playtest the game From Oct. 9 to 20, and this writer was one of the persons invited. </p><h2>An Android and iOS mobile game</h2><p>Guild of Guardians is designed entirely for mobile. You can play it on a mobile phone or tablet, and it’s available for both iOS and Android. But there’s no way currently to play it on a PC or console, and the team doesn’t appear to be planning to make a PC version anytime soon, if ever. The controls of the game are optimized for mobile gameplay, as the battles are mostly automated, with very little real-time control during fights.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-gods-unchained-and-how-to-play-it\"><strong>What is Gods Unchained, and how to play it. </strong></a></em></p><p>In the Guild of Guardians docs, the team emphasized that mobile games are more accessible than any other type of video game. The number of people in the world who own smartphones is much greater than the number who own PCs, which is why they chose to make Guild of Guardians strictly a mobile game with touch-screen controls.</p><h2>A dungeon-crawling adventure</h2><p>Guild of Guardians is a classic “dungeon-crawl” game. The main gameplay consists of progressing through various dungeons, fighting monsters and opening treasure chests for loot. Players can choose which dungeon to explore by clicking on it from within an in-game world map.</p><p>Once a dungeon is chosen, the player’s party of heroes loads into the first room, which usually contains monsters that can be fought. After each room is cleared, the player can choose which room to go to next. Different rooms contain different enemy strengths and rewards, and the player is presented with these metrics when making the decision. Some rooms contain treasure chests, healing or other boosts that may help the party to progress. </p><p>Once a player progresses through all of the choices and defeats all the monsters, the dungeon ends. In this case, the main menu pops back up, and the heroes who died in the dungeon are resurrected. If all party members die before the dungeon is completed, the player fails the dungeon. However, they still get to keep the items they acquired from their partial completion.</p><p>New dungeons become unlocked as old ones are completed. If the player completes all of the dungeons, they unlock a new “infinite” mode. This mode apparently allows a player to play through never-ending randomly generated dungeons for even more loot. I unfortunately didn’t make it far enough to test out infinite mode.</p><h2>Automated battles</h2><p>The game has mostly automated battles. To start a battle, the player clicks on a “fight” button and watches the fight play out. They can choose to activate characters’ ultimate abilities manually, in which case there is some interaction during battles. However, they can also choose to have these abilities activated automatically, making the battles a completely passive experience.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/f0f34dc8-b657-4431-87e2-3820d71f558e.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Battle from an earlier build of Guild of Guardians. Source: Guild of Guardians</em></figcaption></figure><p>The challenge to winning a battle comes from decisions made before it begins. Before entering a dungeon, the player chooses which heroes to put into a party. Each hero has different abilities. Some are tanks or healers, while others are focused on damage-dealing. To succeed, the player needs to create a party out of characters whose abilities complement each other. In addition, characters can be placed in various positions within the party’s formation before a battle begins. Tanks should go in the front, while ranged damage dealers and healers should be placed in the back. Players also influence their ability to win by deciding which gear to outfit their characters with.</p><p>I found that the battles were pretty balanced in terms of difficulty. My party cleaved its way through lots of small trash packs with ease, while there were a few bosses that slaughtered them without mercy. I was happy to see that heroes are automatically resurrected after a dungeon failure.</p><h2>Collecting heroes and crafting</h2><p>Two of the most important goals in Guild of Guardians are to collect heroes and craft equipment. To get a new hero, the player must obtain a “summon,” which allows them to roll for a randomly selected hero. There seems to be a wide variety of heroes that can be collected, each with different artwork, ultimate abilities and stats.</p><p>Some of the “summons” can be obtained as rewards for exploring dungeons, while a certain number are also given out as login rewards. Players get two heroes in the tutorial: one tank and one healer.</p><p>I found that the hero-collecting system was a pretty satisfying reward mechanic. The heroes had a lot of variety in terms of stats and abilities, which made getting a new hero feel significant. </p><p>To craft gear, the player needs to collect crafting materials within dungeons. I crafted a single item throughout my playtest sessions but couldn’t gain more experience than that. The game’s documents state that gear items differ in terms of rarity, with more rare items requiring more rare materials to craft. Different pieces of crafted gear provide different unique buffs; some items are parts of sets that give bigger bonuses if a character wears more than one piece from the set, the documents stated.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/game-review-axie-infinity-currently-rules-the-pay-to-win-to-earn-roost\"><strong>Game review: Axie Infinity currently rules the Pay-to-Win-to-Earn roost</strong></a></em></p><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>The Guild of Guardians demo that I played was an early version of the game. The public release will likely have more features and content. But so far, the game’s development seems to be on the right track. The battles are challenging, and there are a variety of strategic decisions the player has to make in order to succeed. This is not a run-of-the-mill play-to-earn game featuring mindless grinding for cryptocurrency. The gameplay is engaging and requires significant thought from the player. Fans of turn-based RPGs may enjoy Guild of Guardians, as it scratches their itch for strategic challenges.</p><p>On the other hand, players who are looking for Diablo-style real-time action may want to pass over Guild of Guardians when it’s released. The battles in the game are almost entirely automated, so there’s no test of reflexes in this particular dungeon-crawler.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\"><em>The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph. </em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"nifty_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Bitcoin has had an eventful week in terms of price action. The world&#8217;s largest crypto saw an 18% increase in the past seven days, its highest percentage increase this year. This unexpected surge caused a flurry of short position liquidations, and according to Glassnode, 60,000 BTC worth of futures positions were closed. Amidst all the price surge, data from Glassnode has shown a large portion of investors are now breaking above profit.  Bitcoin Surges Past $35,000, Flipping Millions of Coins Into Profit Bitcoin bulls managed to push Bitcoin price above $35,100 in the past 24 hours, marking the biggest one-day increase this year. The upward movement began near the $25,000 level and continued until it reached its new yearly high.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval: Why Price Could Be Set For 300% Surge A blockchain analytics platform Glassnode report showed that Bitcoin zooming past $35,000 is a big deal for holders. At this price level, millions of BTC holdings were pushed into profitability. During this rally, the percent of supply in profit from the $25,000 to $35,000 price jump increased by a massive 4.7M BTC, equivalent to 24% of the total circulating supply.  Long-term investors, in particular, had a big break in profit at this price point. Although approximately 29.6% of long-term holder supply is still held at a loss, their aggregate holdings recently broke into a new all-time high of 14.899 million BTC. Source: Glassnode Short-term holders were also not left out, as investor confidence has recovered from bearish to neutral on the cost-basis models. We&#8217;re now at a crossover point to a positive bullish sentiment for short-term holders. A look into the average buy price of short-term holders puts the majority of entry into the market at $28,000, indicating a profit margin for both short and long-term traders.  Source: Glassnode What&#8217;s Behind Bitcoin&#8217;s Sudden Price Surge? The sudden surge in Bitcoin can be attributed to the excitement behind the approval of BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETFs application. Bitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website, suggesting that BlackRock had begun seeding money for the ETF.  Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Surge Far From Done As Crypto Analyst Predicts Rise To $15 Although Bitcoin has since shed off some of this price gain and is now trading at $33,860 at the time of this writing, metrics show that 80% of holders are making money at the current price. Exchange signals also point to bullish momentum, as traders are now exchanging their assets for BTC on crypto exchanges. The rise in the value of Bitcoin to $35,000 was reflected in the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. At that price, MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings would have generated a profit of $857 million for the company.
