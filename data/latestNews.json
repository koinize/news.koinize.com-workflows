It had some blunt observations about CTPs and suggestions for regulators in a paper released Sept. 28.</p><p>“CTPs should welcome a degree of regulation as a mean[s] to bolster the appeal of their markets,” the WFE wrote. It suggested six principles for regulating CTPs. The first of those was to segregate functions to avoid trading against their customers, a complaint that United States Securities and Exchange Commission chairman <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-gensler-parallels-binance-ftx-sued\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sec-gensler-parallels-binance-ftx-sued/amp\">Gary Gensler often voices</a>. Until they meet those standards, CTPs should not call themselves exchanges, the trade association said. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/cdf0f195-bb8c-4f64-a1fe-f335afcf13f2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Principles for exchanges to live by, according to the WFE. Source: WFE</em></figcaption></figure><p>The WFE was concerned about the integration of distributed ledger technology (DLT) into the TradFi exchanges it represents. Regulators should consider the mutual advantages of that integration, it said:</p><blockquote>“If you make it impossible for regulated institutions to run services in crypto-assets, you effectively chase this business out of the institutions who know how to run it properly, and into the shadows, where it may be run by new entrants with limited experience.” </blockquote><p>FTX experienced a “classic financial services collapse” that was not related to the crypto industry itself,  the WFE said.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/40-of-crypto-trading-platforms-are-decentralized-world-federation-of-exchanges\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/40-of-crypto-trading-platforms-are-decentralized-world-federation-of-exchanges/amp\">40% of crypto trading platforms are decentralized: World Federation of Exchanges</a></em></strong></p><p>It had much to say about decentralized finance (DeFi):</p><blockquote>“DeFi appears to operate differently [from TradFi and CeFi] but the differences are not quite as stark as they seem.

    "description": "After sinking roughly 30% from 2023 highs, Ethereum appears to be bouncing off from the pits of the crypto winter. Looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily and weekly charts, the coin has primary support at around $1,500 and is firm, bouncing off with decent trading volume.  At spot rates, ETH is up approximately 3% following positive developments sparked by the increasing adoption of its layer-2 scaling solution and the recent news that VanEck, a player managing billions of assets, is preparing to launch an Ethereum derivatives product. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Exploding Taking to X on September 28, Alex Masmej, the founder of Showtime, believes that Ethereum&#8217;s layer-2 ecosystem has expanded to such an extent that it no &#8220;longer makes sense to build on other platforms.&#8221; The development and deployment of Ethereum layer-2 solutions took center stage following network congestion, which forced gas fees to spike to record highs in the last bull run. Developers have responded to the network co-founder Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s urging. The expert believes they are quickly constructing and deploying safe, universal platforms that have gained widespread popularity.  Related Reading: Report Reveals Crypto Whale Center With Majority Of Transactions Crossing $1 Million Layer-2 platforms bundle transactions off-chain before confirming them on-chain, allowing for faster and more cost-effective operations while benefiting from the security of Ethereum. As of September 28, there were over 827,000 validators whose job is to confirm transactions and ensure that the network is secure, thanks in part to their geographic distribution.  Most layer-2 solutions use optimistic rollups, including Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet. However, Masmej also said that once ZK rollups, which utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive data, are available, it will end the scalability trilemma, further boosting the capabilities of layer-2 solutions. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” In the founder&#8217;s assessment, high throughput options, including Solana, will be a hedge. At the same time, Cosmos, which drives blockchain interoperability, will act as a long-term source of inspiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum will continue to flourish as Layer-2 options gain traction. Rising TVL And ETH Complex Products Launching According to l2Beat data, popular solutions like Arbitrum and Base, which offer faster and cheaper processing environments while remaining coupled with Ethereum and enjoying the pioneer network&#8217;s fast-move advantage, have larger total value locked (TVL). As of September 28, layer-2 platforms have a TVL of over $10.6 billion, more than Solana&#8217;s market cap, which stood at $8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Beyond layer-2 adoption, ETH is being catalyzed by the news that VanEck, a global asset manager, is preparing to introduce its Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Specifically, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) will invest in ETH futures contracts provided by exchanges approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Like the Bitcoin Futures ETF product, which is already being offered, the Ethereum derivative product will allow institutions to gain exposure, boosting liquidity.
