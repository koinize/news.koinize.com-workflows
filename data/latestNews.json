CEO Luca Schnetzler, 25, explains where everything went right.</p>\n                    <p><p><strong>Pudgy Penguins minted in July 2021, but quickly saw high drama after its former founder came under suspicion he was going to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9x9x9eth/status/1478910303643607040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >rug the project</a>. </strong></p><p>A few months later Luca Schnetzler stepped in. With an entrepreneurial streak since his early teens he had a history of building internet businesses and bought the project and its intellectual property of 8,888 cute little Pudgys for $2.5 million in April 2022.</p><p>It was an instinct and intuitive decision. I saw this thing that I was hugely invested in before I bought it that I thought had all of the potential. I was complaining and crying on a daily basis to the founders about how they sucked, and how they could do better. Rather than just doing that, I just stepped up to the plate, Schnetlzer says.</p><p>The narrative of quickly shifted from a rug that could trend to zero to one of hope and optimism when Schnetzler set out a vision for the project the community could rally behind. </p><p>Schnetzler became one of the standout PFP project leaders during the NFT bear market, and the Penguins bucked the trend of cratering floor prices. Since he took over as CEO, the Pudgy Penguins floor has risen from around the 1 ETH mark to 6.32 ETH. Holders and the wider NFT community believe that Schnetzler has a game plan for success and the ability to execute it.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"341\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-A-Brave-New-World-Twitter-Cover-Photo-1024x341.jpeg\" alt=\"Pudgy Penguins - A Brave New World\" class=\"wp-image-26145\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-A-Brave-New-World-Twitter-Cover-Photo-1024x341.jpeg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-A-Brave-New-World-Twitter-Cover-Photo-300x100.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-A-Brave-New-World-Twitter-Cover-Photo-770x257.jpeg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-A-Brave-New-World-Twitter-Cover-Photo.jpeg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Pudgy Penguins – A Brave New World (X)</em></figcaption></figure><p>He says the decision to snap the project up wasn’t as risky as it may have seemed. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We bought something that netted almost $10 million in six months for $2.5 million. Royalties were making it half a million dollars per month. It was a pretty good business on its face. Intuitively, I think it just comes down to the vision when you close your eyes and you picture Pudgy Penguins, it’s pretty easy to see where this thing can go. </p></blockquote><p>Constant momentum and growth has been key to Pudgys ascent into one of the top PFP projects, with the cute penguin brand spreading across social media outside of traditional crypto channels like X and Discord. Pudgys Instagram has just crossed 1 million followers, while its GIF strategy has been highly effective, only days ago crossing the 10 billion views chasm.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguins GIFs and stickers on GIPHY have reached 10B views. <br><br>With 10B views and millions more each day, our GIFs allow us to cement the Pudgy Penguins IP in internet culture, becoming a brand people interact with every day. <a href=\"https://t.co/odEIPgD2wc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/odEIPgD2wc</a></p>— Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1729275495273938959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >November 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p>Schnetzler thinks its a little bit sad that he gets such praise, when it just highlights how little effort other PFP projects put into trying to grow their brands. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Everyone’s been saying that their NFT project is a brand, they have hundreds of millions of dollars that they raised from the community and venture capital at ridiculous valuations.

The fact that we are doing so many things that so many projects are not doing when they have 10-20 times the resources and 2-3 times the experience is pretty shameful.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"26141\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Pudgy Penguins #6775\" class=\"wp-image-26141\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large-770x770.jpeg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6775-Large.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Pudgy Penguins #6775 (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"26139\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Pudgy Penguins #6179\" class=\"wp-image-26139\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large-770x770.jpeg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-6179-Large.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Pudgy Penguins #6179 (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"26146\"  src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Pudgy Penguins #3564\" class=\"wp-image-26146\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large-770x770.jpeg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pudgy-Penguins-3564-Large.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Pudgy Penguins #3564 (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-entrepreneurial-spirit\"><strong>Finding the entrepreneurial spirit </strong></h2><p>Despite only being 25 years old, Schnetzler actually started his entrepreneurial journey over a decade ago. Growing up poor and bouncing around couch to couch at friends places, Schnetzler says he needed to start earning at a young age.</p><p>I’ve really been out of school working for 10 years and it’s pretty crazy to say, but thats what its been,” he says, noting most people dont even start working until they finish college in their 20s</p><p>Then you do 10 years after you leave college and you’re 33, and then people start to see success in their 30s. That seems to be the time horizon. I think my childhood forced me to start early. I didnt have the luxury of chilling out or having a childhood where I could just go home and play video games and not worry about anything. I was forced to go work and figure things out.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-character-building-versus-brand-building\"><strong>Character building versus brand building </strong></h2><p>To date, most PFP projects are built around a centralized character with a variety of different traits to give each NFT a slightly different look and feel. Take the OG collection <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptopunks-nfts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >CryptoPunks</a>, the Bored Apes, and it is also true for the Pudgys. But it’s not the case for Gary Vees VeeFriends, which boasts 270 individual characters.</p><p>Schnetzler believes character building around one individual character is the easier of the two options. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/attack-zkevms-cryptos-10x-moment/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Attack of the zkEVMs!

It’s part of the cards I was dealt and have, and he created his cards. I think he’s doing a great job with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/veefriends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >VeeFriends</a>. I think ultimately he has to create familiarity. Creating familiarity around a character is a lot easier than creating familiarity around a brand, says Schnetzler.</p><p>Theyre two different things and because his universe isn’t predicated on one character, but a multitude of different characters and different animals in different shapes. He is betting and taking a shot at the brand, and the brand name versus the character. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I’m going after the character first and then worrying about the brand because I believe there’s enough people that love penguins and few enough penguin brands out there.</p></blockquote><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"518\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca-Netz-IRL-at-Walmart-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Luca Schnetzler IRL at Walmart\" class=\"wp-image-26143\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca-Netz-IRL-at-Walmart-Medium.jpeg 518w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Luca-Netz-IRL-at-Walmart-Medium-243x300.jpeg 243w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Luca Schnetzler IRL at Walmart (X)</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-brave-new-world-walmart-pallet-program\"><strong>A brave new world – Walmart pallet program </strong></h2><p>In September this year, Pudgys announced a groundbreaking deal with retail giant Walmart that saw Pudgy Penguin physical toys available for sale and in prominent locations in over 2,000 stores throughout the U.S.</p><p>The pallet program is one of the most prestigious places you can get because it gives prime real estate to people walking the floor. It signals Walmart’s belief in the brand and their belief in NFTs and Web3 being a vertical for their retail locations, says Schnetzler.</p><p>If that can become a general norm in the worlds biggest retailer it gives us a real shot to succeed. Its one thing to be in the crevices of the toy shelf, its another thing to be front and center for everyone to see. That program doesnt happen for brand-new brands.

Our commitment is embedded in preventing the disintermediation of creators from the Web3 growth.” </blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Rarible co-founder Alex Salnikov said they believe Web3 should be a “creator-centric ecosystem” that allows artists to thrive. Salnikov claims that the RARI Chain is a move to protect creators’ earnings. “By enforcing royalties at the node level, we are ensuring that creator royalties are more than just a promise, they are a guarantee,” he said. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blur-token-rewards-nft-marketplace-airdrop\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/blur-token-rewards-nft-marketplace-airdrop/amp\"><strong><em>User claims $11M in Blur token rewards at NFT marketplace’s season 2 airdrop</em></strong></a> </p><p>According to the announcement, their partners Arbitrum, LayerZero, WalletConnect, and many others will actively contribute support to the new chain.
