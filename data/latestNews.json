It’s not surprising that crypto traders would consider leveraging trading bots, which can monitor the market 24/7, analyze ever-inflowing and changing data and follow established instructions to automatically buy and sell crypto. Bots don’t need sleep and won’t make mistakes due to fatigue, impulse or emotion, and they can react in a fraction of a second.</p> <p>Bots can be incredibly valuable tools for crypto traders, but along with their many advantages, they do have significant limitations as well. If traders rely too heavily or uncritically on bots, the results may not be what they were hoping for. Below, 10 members of <a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/?_ga=2.198681135.1484442309.1667485998-1927108766.1652715111\">Cointelegraph Innovation Circle</a> share their advice for traders who are considering adding trading bots to their investment toolkits — their counsel can help both experienced and new traders leverage bots both wisely and well.</p> <h2>Maintain constant touch points</h2> <p>As is noted in conversations around innovations in artificial intelligence, technology is always limited by its programming, and crypto participants would be wise to remember that. Therefore, when choosing to utilize trading bots, it’s imperative to tailor expectations and maintain constant touch points to ensure they’re carrying out actions as specified. Traders who opt to put their finances on autopilot tend to regret that flight path. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/83c71aad-8be6-470a-aaf9-7f146821217c\"> Oleksandr Lutskevych</a>,<a href=\"http://cex.io\"> CEX.IO</a></p> <h2>Utilize a trusted exchange</h2> <p>With respect to utilizing bots on-chain, ensure you utilize a trusted exchange with reliable developers. Your trades are at the mercy of code, so ensure you’re utilizing an exchange that satisfies your risk tolerance. Always do your own research and understand that any trade, with or without a bot, bears a risk. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/84007b98-8c0e-4c02-8807-ff7876b7765d\"> Megan Nyvold</a>,<a href=\"http://bingx.com/en-us/\"> BingX</a></p> <h2>Know that a bot’s performance can suffer during unpredictable events</h2> <p>Traders should remember that while trading bots can automate and optimize transactions, they lack human intuition and can’t adapt to unexpected market changes. These bots are bound by preset rules, and their performance can suffer during unpredictable market events. Hence, supervision and periodic manual intervention are essential. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/0d167285-44f8-41a6-9001-72aab6b4058d\"> Tomer Warschauer Nuni</a>,<a href=\"http://www.kryptomon.co\"> Kryptomon</a></p> <h2>Be wary of bots that rely solely on historical data</h2> <p>Traders should be cautious with bots that rely solely on historical data. Unexpected events like regulatory changes or technological advancements could cause significant market changes that bots may miss. Traders need to have a broader understanding of the market to anticipate and adjust to these changes. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/a27b7ccb-dfb8-468f-83ae-4aac596f0a40\"> Vinita Rathi</a>,<a href=\"https://www.systango.com\"> Systango</a></p> <h2>Understand when your human intuition may be needed</h2> <p>Trading bots are not foolproof. They’re still subject to technical issues, software bugs and sudden market changes, which can lead to substantial losses. The lack of human intuition plays a role here. Certain events can have an impact on the market that bots may not be programmed to handle. Regular monitoring and risk management are crucial when using trading bots for crypto. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/5cae7f29-8588-4852-bb31-c66fd1d805c6\"> Anthony Georgiades</a>,<a href=\"https://pastel.network/\"> Pastel Network</a></p> <h2>Be cognizant of all the variables that can occur in a trade</h2> <p>Traders should always keep in mind all of the situations — such as false breakouts — that might occur while making a trade. Further, most of the indicators used in trading are not of an exact nature and can mislead a bot if it’s not well-programmed. Traders should always keep up with constant monitoring, even if they are using bots. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/1d9f8b61-2e77-4452-a837-4db4245d01ca\"> Abhishek Singh</a>,<a href=\"http://acknoledger.com/\"> Acknoledger</a></p> <h2>Research the impact AI is having</h2> <p>Artificial intelligence has changed the trading bot game. In the past, a bot’s limitations would have included over-optimization, impeding its capacity to handle current events; a lack of human intuition; and the inability to react correctly to unexpected volatility. With AI, trading bots are starting to run with the required “human element.” Despite this, however, programming issues will still persist. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/bcb46b42-12ad-4937-8069-b741c596ef3c\"> Sheraz Ahmed</a>,<a href=\"http://storm.partners/\"> STORM Partners</a></p> <h2>Get familiar with how bots analyze information</h2> <p>Most trading bots rely on<a href=\"https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method\"> Wyckoff</a> chart analysis techniques, which are great for technical analysis. But if a fundamental event happens that no one has factored into the price, expect what looked like a “sure bull pattern” to head south. Always monitor what is happening with a trade. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/008ee5ae-3d26-4c82-a558-db3e57e4c769\"> Zain Jaffer</a>,<a href=\"http://www.zain-ventures.com\"> Zain Ventures</a></p> <h2>Don’t miss swing-trading opportunities</h2> <p>While trading bots are great at eliminating emotions while trading, they also lack decision-making skills and reactivity. While you can program stop-loss orders and take-profit targets, sudden, wild swings are often when human traders are able to take profitable advantage of the market with an immediate strategy change. Bots can’t. Be sure to set alarms so you never miss a swing-trading opportunity! –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/16cde551-5395-4ca9-8281-7152cbb88396\"> Tiago Serôdio</a>,<a href=\"https://www.partisiablockchain.com/\"> Partisia Blockchain</a></p> <h2>Remember the importance of mood in the crypto market</h2> <p>Trading bots’ pre-programmed algorithms can’t predict human sentiment or market changes, a less-obvious drawback. They cannot “feel” the market’s mood, which is vital in highly speculative and emotionally driven crypto markets. They may ignore market sentiment on social media, news events and regulatory developments, which can greatly affect Bitcoin pricing. –<a href=\"https://circle.cointelegraph.com/u/8179044f-5f09-469d-8c72-d17fd6274257\"> Arvin Khamseh</a>,<a href=\"http://soldoutnfts.io\"> SOLDOUT NFTs</a></p> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> <p><em>This article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/key-bullish-bitcoin-metrics/",
    "description": "As the bear market continues to linger, several market analysts have pointed out key metrics or factors that show that the Bitcoin bull market might not be far off. This time, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts has identified key Bitcoin adoption metrics that provide bullish signals to the crypto community. What Are These Key Bitcoin Metrics? In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Coutts noted that “HODLers” and transactions on the Bitcoin network were at an all-time high. According to the update he shared, the number of addresses holding more than 1 BTC is at its highest over the last five years.  Related Reading: Market Analysts Outline When The First Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved In the past month, there has also been close to a 1% increase in persons holding more than one 1 BTC. Meanwhile, the volume of Bitcoin transactions, entity-adjusted ones, has surged by over 9% in the past month. This metric also has a 99.8% percentile over the last five years. These two metrics form part of key metrics used to determine how widely the Bitcoin network and token are adopted. Their being in the green is undoubtedly bullish, especially considering that many have been said to have left the crypto market because of the lingering conditions. The first metric shows that more addresses are accumulating BTC, and a significant chunk of it, even though the crypto token has been tepid for a while now. The entity-adjusted metric is even more significant as it measures the number of unique Bitcoin users rather than active wallets.  However, there are some negatives from the Bitcoin on-chain update that Coutts laid out. The value of this entity-adjusted bitcoin transactions has dropped by over 30% in the past year (although it is up by %30 in the last three years). The median transfer value has also decreased drastically (over 98% in the last three years), putting it also in the bottom percentile over the last five years.  This shows that the economic value of the network is down even though adoption is currently at an all-time high.  BTC price looks strong above $26,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Worrying Concerns Around Bitcoin’s Adoption There has been increased institutional interest in the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, especially with traditional fund managers moving to offer several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, following this interest, many have become wary about the true intentions of these fund managers and how they could make Bitcoin more centralized. These concerns are likely to be further fueled by a recent revelation made by Coutss. In a tweet released on September 26, he pointed out that three asset managers (Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street) are major investors in the three biggest publicly traded mining companies.  Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High While he stated that his statement shouldn’t be taken as FUD, he raised concerns about what this could mean for the Bitcoin network as these fund managers account for “about 8.9% of the global hash.”  According to him, there might be the risk of “creeping influence that might conflict” with the network’s values. He believes these companies could go as far as censoring transactions with such influence.  This development is more significant because BlackRock is one of several fund managers that have filed to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF.  Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
