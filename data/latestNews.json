A maximal extractable value (MEV) bot subsequently picked up the discrepancy, netting a total of $107,002 in profits through an arbitrage trade. </p><p>During periods of poor liquidity, slippage on DEXs can reach as high as 100%.

Despite being 100% backed, less than 15% of its then $45 million in assets were backed by liquid project tokens TNGBL, with the remaining backed by illiquid tokenized real-estate assets.</p><p>As narrated by analyst Tom Wan, the tokenized assets were minted on the ERC-721 standard, which could not be fractionalized to create liquidity for investor redemptions. In addition, the underlying homes could not be immediately sold to meet investors' withdrawal requests. Altogether, the Real USD Treasury could not meet the redemptions, leading to a collapse in investors' confidence.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why USDR depegged despite being fully backed: Using Illiquid asset backing liquid Asset<br><br>- USDR is 100% backed. 50% of them come from stablecoins and the remaining comes from Real-Estate<br><br>- When there is a bank-run (Huge Redemption of USDR), the Stablecoin liquidity in the… <a href=\"https://t.co/xOrsa5gpKU\">https://t.co/xOrsa5gpKU</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OYhQ0twUUd\">pic.twitter.com/OYhQ0twUUd</a></p>&mdash; Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1712379528138633327?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-zero-knowledge-voting-finance/\">Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance</a></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
