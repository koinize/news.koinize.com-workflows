Its also releasing software that will make it easier to play Windows games on Mac.</p><p>Gaming on a Mac really sucks. Lots of games  particularly indie and early release ones  are not compatible. Keyboard mapping can be funky. To this day I have been unable to attach special tackles to my fishing rod (no, that is not innuendo) on the Mac edition of Stardew Valley.</p><p>With VR games, its even worse. If you want to spend hours watching YouTube videos, you can get most VR headsets to somewhat work with a Mac. But right now the only one that is really officially compatible seems to be the HTC Vive.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-1024x582.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses Apple Vision Pro\" class=\"wp-image-21106\" width=\"617\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-770x438.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-1536x873.jpg 1536w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-2048x1164.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Are headsets the future of surfing the web?

Its hard to justify that much money for exploring the empty, laggy metaverse when you could spend a few months travelling and seeing some of the coolest places in the actual world for the same price.</p><h2>The endless legal wrangling over in-game virtual assets</h2><p>The Sandbox, Decentraland and Axie Infinitys tokens  SAND, MANA and AXS, respectively  made cameo appearances in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against crypto exchange Binance, which was filed on June 5.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-101.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >complaint</a> against the crypto exchange contains 13 charges, including that Binance sold unregistered securities. The SEC counted SAND, MANA and AXS among such securities  meaning it considers them to be types of investments, not currencies.</p><p>Speaking at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) in Lisbon, Portugal on June 7, The Sandbox COO Sebastien Borget said that his team were aware of the litigation but that they are not themselves subject to any.</p><p>We do not necessarily agree with the characterization thats been put in that litigation, including the qualification of SAND as a security there, he said, adding that it would not change the companys day-to-day business.</p><p>Since the announcement, eToro has said it will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/etoro-algo-mana-matic-dash-purchases-us-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >delist several tokens</a>, including MANA, for US-based customers.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">eToro has a framework in place which reviews the cryptoassets we offer in light of the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.

Second Life got its <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2818829/second-life-creates-a-millionaire.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >first millionaire</a> in 2006 and the question of who owes what to who has continued, exacerbated by the fact that many developers and creators already feel they pay large “taxes” to platforms.</p><p>Yet previous conversations have mostly been centered around making sure those that sell virtual assets or developer games on platforms are taxed correctly, not about investment and likely because Web2 virtual currencies act more like, well, currencies.</p><p>At last check, the USs IRS doesnt seem to be too concerned with virtual currencies if they dont leave a game.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/steemit-andrew-levine-tron-acquisition/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Exoduses and Ex-Communications: Blowing Off Steemit with Andrew Levine</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-bedford-soccer-team-puts-bitcoin-on-the-map/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Peter McCormacks Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><h2>Avalanche wants to help Web2 gaming leaders go Web3</h2><p>The quest by blockchains to convert gaming companies to the dark side continues with Ava Labs launch of Arcad3, a program to help Web2 gaming giants launch powerful blockchain deployments.</p><p>Ava Labs, which has supported gaming companies in building out more than ten gaming subnets on Avalanche and over 100 Web3 games, will work with teams on game monetisation, marketing, user acquisition, and risk management.</p><p>Among the first companies taking part are Tokyo-based firms Gumi and GREE (not to be confused with the Chinese aircon giant, GREE Electrics), as well as Shrapnel, DeFi Kingdoms and Gunz Chain by Gunzilla.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"591\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shrapnel.jpg\" alt=\"Shrapnel\" class=\"wp-image-21139\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shrapnel.jpg 591w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shrapnel-300x171.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The team behind Shrapnel is among those taking part in the program.

Cohen made his fortune founding online pet supplies retailer Chewy but is perhaps better known for his involvement with memestocks. He successfully rallied people to invest in companies like Bed, Bath and Beyond, and GameStop itself, causing the prices to skyrocket.
