To me, that's the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It's limited in the amount that there can be [and] people mine it with their own [computer].”</blockquote><p>“That to me is very fascinating. I love the fact that it's been implemented,” Rogan added.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I disagree with Joe Rogan here. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> won’t become a “universal, viable currency”.<br><br>It already is universal, viable currency being used by millions of people globally.<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/RpMIHrQMUg\">pic.twitter.com/RpMIHrQMUg</a></p>&mdash; Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1710476001883640172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 7, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Altman, however, has been a long supporter of Bitcoin well before the podcast. In a blog post dated 10 years ago, Altman <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/?page=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">argued</a> that a world transacting in Bitcoin would be more transparent. </p><p>“A world where we all transact in Bitcoin would be much more transparent, and financial transparency is great. It’s perhaps the thing that would most reduce corruption,” Altman said.</p><h3>Rogan, Altman ‘very worried’ about CBDCs, slams U.S. war on crypto</h3><p>Meanwhile, both Altman and Rogan said they were “super against” CBDCs and expressed worry about the United States becoming a surveillance state.</p><p>Rogan argued that CBDCs could <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-anti-cbdc-bill-moves-closer-to-passing\">give governments even more control</a> over how people spend their money:</p><blockquote>“I'm very worried about central bank digital currency and that being tied to a social credit score. That scares the shit out of me. The push to that is not for the overall good of society, that's for control.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdc-frameworks-must-guard-user-privacy-monetary-freedom-of-choice-bis-chief\"><strong><em>CBDC frameworks must guard user privacy, monetary freedom — BIS chief</em></strong></a></p><p>Altman added he hasn’t been impressed with how the U.S. government has treated the cryptocurrency industry recently:</p><p>“There's many things that I’m disappointed that the U.S. government has done recently, but the war on crypto, which I think is a like, we can’t give this up, like we’re going to control this and all that. That's the thing that makes me quite sad about the country,” he said.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/china-expands-cbdcs-tentacles-malaysia-is-hks-new-crypto-rival-asia-express/\"><strong><em>Asia Express: China expands CBDC’s tentacles, Malaysia is HK’s new crypto rival</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
