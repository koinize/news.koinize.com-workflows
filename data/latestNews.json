After a sharp rally, if the price does not give up much ground, it may cause FOMO and ignite another round of buying. </p><p>That could push the markets further into overbought territory. However, such rallies are rarely sustainable. They eventually turn down and retest the breakout levels. Hence, Bitcoin’s drop to $32,000 can not be ruled out.</p><p>The rally of the past few days pushed <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-hits-54-ahead-btc-halving\">Bitcoin’s dominance to 54%</a>, its highest level in 30 months. The rise in market dominance shows that Bitcoin is leading the charge higher, which is a positive sign. This suggests that traders are favorably viewing the cryptocurrency space and select altcoins may join the party soon.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/7121b7ab-30cf-4bb4-b583-2776914df073.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

Meanwhile, Brandt predicts Bitcoin to enter a “chop fest.”</p><p>Will Bitcoin enter a corrective phase over the next few days or continue its upward march? Will altcoins join the party higher?</p><p>Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin is facing resistance at $35,000 but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers may soon try to resume the up-move.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/cfc3d0c6-9386-4f56-af0f-f4a5b2d18474.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The risk to a further rise is that the relative strength index (RSI) remains in the overbought area. This indicates the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price slides below $33,679, the BTC/USDT pair could retest $32,400 and then $31,000.</p><p>However, it is not certain that the overbought levels on the RSI will cause a correction. Sometimes, during a trend change from bearish to bullish, the RSI tends to remain in overbought territory for a long time. That is because the smart buyers continue to accumulate on every intraday dip.</p><p>In this case, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $35,280, it will signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The pair may then skyrocket to $40,000.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) long wick on the Oct. 26 candlestick shows that the bears are aggressively protecting the minor overhead resistance at $1,855.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/63dc5248-23b9-49a2-9609-698c0fc1f94d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The rising 20-day EMA ($1,674) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price turns up from $1,746, the bulls will again try to shove the ETH/USDT pair above $1,855. If this level is surmounted, the pair may skyrocket toward the psychologically important level of $2,000.</p><p>If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly send the price back below the breakout level of $1,746. The pair may then tumble to the 20-day EMA.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) turned down from $235 on Oct. 24, indicating that the bears are active at this level. The sellers tried but failed to sustain the price below the strong support at $223.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/7898dc5e-80a9-47b5-9213-2c2e135c5bf9.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>This indicates that buyers are fiercely attempting to defend the support at $223. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, the BNB/USDT pair could once again try to rise above the overhead resistance at $235. If that happens, the pair may climb to $250 and subsequently to $265.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price once again turns down from $235, it will suggest that bears continue to sell at higher levels. A slide below $223 will tilt the advantage back in favor of the bears. The pair may then oscillate between $203 and $235 for a while longer.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the overhead resistance of $0.56.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/3cf211b3-cc7b-454c-a2ff-d67d1faf7a02.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears are trying to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.52) which is an important level to keep an eye on. If the price sharply rebounds off this level, it will suggest that every minor dip is being bought. The bulls will then again try to kick the price above $0.56. </p><p>If they succeed, it will signal the start of a new up-move. The XRP/USDT pair could then soar to $0.71. This positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 50-day SMA ($0.51). That will indicate a range-bound action between $0.46 and $0.56 in the near term.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) has been trading near the pattern target of $32.81 for the past few days. The bulls have not ceded ground to the bears, indicating that they anticipate another leg higher.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/4298b29b-cf6a-4c3a-91c1-ec813fb0c73d.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The RSI remains in the overbought zone, indicating that the SOL/USDT pair may spend some more time in consolidation or witness a minor dip. If the price stays above $30, the possibility of a rally to $38.79 increases.</p><p>On the other hand, if the price skids below $30, the bears will attempt to yank the price to the 20-day EMA ($27.20). If this support gives way, it will signal that the sellers are back in the game.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been trading above the $0.28 level for the past few days but the bulls haven’t been able to start a strong relief rally.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/23a35743-815c-4df2-861b-4524f9d128ba.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers tried to start a new up-move on Oct. 26 but the bears sold at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick. Encouraged by this, the sellers will try to tug the price back below the breakout level of $0.28. If they can pull it off, the ADA/USDT pair may slump to the 20-day EMA ($0.26).</p><p>Instead, if the price turns up from $0.28 and rises above $0.30, it will signal that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The pair may then start its northward march toward $0.32. This level may act as a stiff barrier but if cleared, the next stop is likely to be $0.38.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) has been in a strong recovery for the past few days, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/f28b4068-0bff-4f56-bed7-83138e783bcf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers pushed the price above the nearest resistance of $0.07 on Oct. 26 but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. The bears are trying to pull the price back below $0.07 on Oct. 27. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could slide to the 20-day EMA ($0.06).</p><p>On the contrary, if the price turns up from $0.07, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and every minor dip is being purchased. That could propel the price to $0.08.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/floki-price-soars-140-memecoins-doge-pepe\"><strong><em>FLOKI price soars 140% in a week — Are memecoins like DOGE, PEPE finally waking up?</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) found support at the moving averages in the past few days but the bulls failed to start a strong rebound off it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/009588f9-3ce5-4431-a050-2c7a9e8f0ef5.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart.

The TON/USDT pair may slide to the crucial support at $1.89. Such a move will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $1.89 and $2.31 for a few days.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up sharply from the current level, it will indicate that the bulls are buying on minor dips. That will improve the prospects of a break above $2.31. The pair may then surge to $2.59.</p><h2>Chainlink price analysis</h2><p>Chainlink (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/chainlink-price-index\">LINK</a>) has been facing selling near the $11.50 mark as seen from the long wick on the candlesticks of the past few days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/8380e80c-eef7-4971-a26a-97382046bf15.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AlinkUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A minor positive is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are in no hurry to book profits as they anticipate the uptrend to continue. Sometimes, when an asset breaks out from a long consolidation, it may remain in the overbought zone for an extended period. That is a possibility with the LINK/USDT pair.</p><p>The important support to watch on the downside is $9.50 and then the 20-day EMA ($8.97). Buyers are expected to defend this zone with vigor.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) broke above the $0.60 resistance on Oct. 22 but the bulls are struggling to maintain the up-move. This suggests hesitation to continue buying at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/897fde5b-4d94-4df6-b39e-77cc34494bfb.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AMATICUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The important level to watch on the downside is $0.60. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, it will signal that the bulls have flipped $0.60 into support. That will increase the likelihood of a break above $0.67. The MATIC/USDT pair may then soar to $0.77.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price back below the breakout level of $0.60. If they do that, several aggressive bulls may get trapped and the pair may plummet to the 20-day EMA ($0.57).</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The protocols advocated for the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/connext-alchemix-cross-chain-token-standard-reduce-bridge-exploit-losses\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/connext-alchemix-cross-chain-token-standard-reduce-bridge-exploit-losses/amp\">use of the xERC-20 token standard</a> for bridging stETH instead of using LayerZero’s new token.</p><p>Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/defis-next-big-thing-liquid-staking-derivatives\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/defis-next-big-thing-liquid-staking-derivatives/amp\">liquid staking derivative</a> produced when a user deposits Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) into the Lido protocol for staking. On October 25, LayerZero <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1717224879869907065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">launched</a> a bridged version of stETH, called \"Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH)\" on BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Scroll. Prior to this launch, stETH was not available on these three networks. </p><p>Since any protocol can create a bridged version of a token, LayerZero was able to launch wstETH without needing the approval of Lido’s governing body, LidoDAO. In addition, both BNB Chain and LayerZero announced the token’s launch on X (formerly Twitter), and BNB Chain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1717360402009321581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tagged</a> the Lido development team in its announcement. Members of LidoDAO later claimed that these actions were an attempt to mislead users into believing that the new token had support from the DAO. </p><p>On the same day that LayerZero launched wstETH, they <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/wsteth-on-avalanche-and-bnb-and-ownership-acceptance-by-lido-dao/5749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> that LidoDAO should approve the new token as the official version of stETH on the three new networks. They offered to transfer control of the token’s protocol to LidoDAO, relinquishing LayerZero’s administration of it.

    "description": "The price of Bitcoin stands firm around the critical area of $34,000, hinting at further bullish potential. However, market analysts wonder if enough clues point to the upside or if BTC will return to $20,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think As of this writing, BTC trades at $34,150 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recorded a 15% profit the previous week and remains a top coin performer by market cap. Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Rises Hinting At A Bull Run? Data from the analytics platform mempool.space shows an increase in on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network. This spike occurred in February 2023, when BTC transactions rose above 50 Mega Virtual bytes (MvB). According to the analytics platform, the above metric measures the size of transactions and blocks on the BTC network. The larger the transaction, the more space they required. As seen in the chart below, each time there is a rise in the price of BTC, there is a surge of activity leading to the rally. This happened in 2017, and 2021, and it is happening this year, which suggests the ecosystem is blooming, onboarding more users, and preparing for a more significant rally like in the previous year. In addition to the increase in activity, it is possible to see the decline in the metric during the bear market and conclude bull markets record high activity. In contrast, the bear market records much less user activity, and they are generally cheaper to transact. However, unlike 2017 and 2021, this year, this ecosystem saw the implementation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and new applications boosting these metrics. Thus, it is harder to determine if the current rally can reach similar levels than in previous years as the BTC DeFi ecosystem attracts more users looking to leverage the network for utility rather than long-term investing. BTC DeFi Makes A Difference In Key BTC Metric? A Chat With The Team Behind “Leather” The surge in BTC on-chain activity could be attributed to the cyclical nature of the crypto market. When the price of BTC and others rise, or there is an expectation of further profits, more users on-board the network. As a result, the number of transactions recorded increases. However, many believe that with the implementation of NFTs in the BTC ecosystem, transaction activity can no longer be attributed to a new bullish cycle.

To answer this question, we spoke with Mark Hendrickson, a General Manager at Trust Machines, a company working on a Bitcoin DeFi wallet. This is what he told us: What is “Leather,” and what is your goal in the Bitcoin ecosystem? A: Leather is a web3 wallets built around Bitcoin based technologies and applications. And so you can think of Leather, simply put as MetaMask for Bitcoin in the sense that we want to provide a robust user experience for connecting to applications built with Bitcoin and Bitcoin layers in which users can do a lot of the same sort of things that they can concurrently only do on smart contracts enabled L1 chains, but to do them actually on Bitcoin. So, Leather has the ability to connect the applications, identify yourself to those applications based on your Bitcoin addresses and your associated assets with those applications prompts for signed transactions that are essentially actions for those applications and to do so across layers. (…) We also want to facilitate the movement of liquidity between L1 and L2 (networks) and do so in a very seamless manner. &#160; A lot of people, for many reasons, are unfamiliar with the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. Can you tell us more about it, and what is Leather’s role in it? Also, what do you say to users who want Bitcoin to remain unchanged, the way it has been since its inception in 2009? A: Bitcoin based DeFi, I&#8217;d say is generally taking place these days or sort of emerging in two places. You have primitives for Bitcoin based divide on Bitcoin itself. That&#8217;s an L1 (Layer one), mostly driven by Ordinals and within Ordinals fungible token standards like BRC 20. And then you have also Bitcoin related taking place on Layer2 like Stacks that have smart contract functionality. (&#8230;) most of that&#8217;s taking place via Ordinals on the layers. It&#8217;s taking place mostly through the native smart contracting capabilities of those layers. To the question of people who want Bitcoin to remain unchanged, I think that the folks who are working on Bitcoin-related functionality, I&#8217;d say Bitcoin web3 in general, which includes DeFi. We&#8217;re trying actually to do more with Bitcoin without having to change Bitcoin really at all. So actually our general approach is to try to extend what you can do with Bitcoin without having to change it fundamentally because we do, of course, want to respect all the work that&#8217;s gone into Bitcoin to date and we&#8217;d love the security profile of Bitcoin. And that has to do with taking a relatively conservative approach. And so if you look at Ordinals, for example, which is really an innovation based on taproot introduced fairly recently, there&#8217;s a lot of innovation going on as a result of taproot ordinals without having really changed anything else about Bitcoin. It is a design space that is actually quite respectful of Bitcoin as blockchain. &#160; There is a theory that every bull run is preceded by an increase in on-chain activity, with fees following prices on their way to new highs. What do you think of network activity right now? Do you think much of it can now be attributed to Ordinals and other applications? A: Going back to the start of the year, Ordinals has been a huge exception to the general rule of the crypto bear market because we&#8217;ve experienced essentially two bull runs inside of Ordinals itself, which I think have boosted Bitcoin&#8217;s position and definitely has boosted network activity on Bitcoin and fee rates have gone up as a result of it. And really shown that this idea of storing data on chain on Bitcoin beyond just simple transactions and applying those primitives to various web3 applications, whether it&#8217;s art or whether it&#8217;s new token standards, that can have a huge effect on just how Bitcoin is used and also valued. (&#8230;) it&#8217;s hard for me to really pinpoint any given reason why any given month the Bitcoin may have gone up in price because of other factors, but it, it&#8217;s pretty clear that it has an overall effect (on network activity). Ordinals has been a positive influence on the interest in Bitcoin. &#160; ETFs, store of value, Gold 2.0, Halving, and now Bitcoin DeFi, what is the current narrative dominating the BTC market? And which narrative will gain more prominence in the long run? A: I think the dominant narrative around Bitcoin is probably that in the wake of the last crash, really it&#8217;s a spillover from last year. I think there are a lot of weaker technologies, weaker platforms and assets that were shaken out and people ran away from and they&#8217;ve taken more safe harbor and Bitcoin come back to Bitcoin as really the one that&#8217;s stood the test of time. So that combined with the fact that people, since the start of the year with Ordinals in particular have opened up to that there are more frontiers to what you can do with Bitcoin. I think that combination has really driven sort of a renewed enthusiasm around Bitcoin. It&#8217;s a combination of, it&#8217;s been around the longest, it&#8217;s the most secure, plus it&#8217;s not a dinosaur that can&#8217;t evolve still. It actually has a lot of potential. It actually has both of those qualities that are very attractive, secure and conservative in one way, but it&#8217;s also more innovative and there&#8217;s more potential than people had realized before on the other hand.
