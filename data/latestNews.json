With options trading, investors can make predictions about the future movement of particular stocks or bonds and the stock market as a whole. Under options contracts, traders have the choice — but not the obligation — to purchase or sell an underlying asset by a specified date at a predetermined price.</p><p>These options are traded on exchanges like the Cboe and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Clearinghouses like the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) provide guarantees for the exchanges.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-ceo-regulators-approve-listed-options-spot-bitcoin-etfs\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
