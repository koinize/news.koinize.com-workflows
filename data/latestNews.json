Meanwhile, KuCoin denied a report claiming it's gearing up to cut 30% of its staff, saying any cuts would follow a \"normal\" employee performance review.</p><p>A recent survey of its members conducted by the CFA Institute revealed that a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-indian-investment-professionals-show-strong-support-cbdc-cfa-institute-survey\">majority of Indian and Chinese respondents</a> support central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. </p><p>Seventy percent of investment professionals in China and 66% in India answered “yes” to the question of whether central banks should launch CBDCs. In emerging markets as a whole, 61% of respondents were favorable toward CBDCs.

There is “no guarantee of public acceptance” of CBDCs, said Margaret Franklin, the CEO of CFA Insittute. </p><h2>Support for CBDC growing among Chinese, Indian investment professionals</h2><h3>Singapore High Court rules crypto personal property, compares it to fiat money</h3><p>Cryptocurrency is property capable of being held in trust, Judge Philip Jeyaretnam ofthe High Court of Singapore ruled on July 25. The judge said he didn’t see any difference between crypto, fiat money or shells as long as all those objects, physical or not, share value created by mutual faith in them. </p><p>Jeyaretnam handed down his ruling in a case brought by Bybit against its former employee, Ho Kai Xin. Bybit claimed the staff member transferred around 4.2 million of Tether from the crypto exchange to her private accounts. The court has now ordered Ho, who has accused a non-present cousin of controlling the relevant accounts, to return the money to Bybit.</p><p>While the decision may seem obvious, it contains some formulations important for the juridical status of digital assets. Jeyaretnam calls the stolen USDT, as well as cryptocurrencies in general, property. </p><p>Even though they don’t have any physical presence, the judge said: </p><blockquote>“We identify what is going on as a particular digital token, somewhat like how we give a name to a river even though the water contained within its banks is constantly changing.”</blockquote><p>He rebuts the common suspicion of crypto not having any “real” value, reminding that value is “a judgment made by an aggregate of human minds.” Jeyaretnam also classifies crypto in the category of “things in action.” In British common law, that means a type of property over which personal rights could be claimed or enforced by legal action, not by taking physical possession<strong>.</strong></p><h3>KuCoin denies mass layoffs, cuts part of 'normal' operations </h3><p>Crypto exchange KuCoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kucoin-denies-layoffs-staff-cuts-normal-process\">dismissed rumors</a> that it was gearing up to cut 30% — around 300 — of its staff in the coming weeks, with a spokesperson telling Cointelegraph it \"has not initiated any alleged layoff plans.”</p><p>The spokesperson added any potential cuts would be part of its semi-annual employee performance review where \"there might be some personnel adjustments as needed, which is a normal process in organizational development.”</p><p>In a July 25 tweet, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu claimed it's still operating smoothly and potential staff cuts would come from its performance evaluation that's part of its plan to stay \"competitive and dynamic.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ I&#39;m aware of some rumors floating around about KuCoin.

Uyeda ultimately declined to support the proposed rule changes.</p><p>Gensler acknowledged the existing rules but added that the shifting technological landscape called for an update. </p><p>In defending the need for change, Gensler related a story about his childhood:</p><blockquote>“My mom used to dress my identical twin brother Rob in red and me in green. You say, ‘Rob Red, Gary Green.' I might not act as favorably to green prompts. I love [my mother], but maybe a little too much green for me.”</blockquote><p>Citing his personal disdain for green and disclosing to the panel that he’s “kind of a rom-com guy,” Gensler appeared to relate that his personal preferences — something ostensibly discoverable via predictive data analytics — were analogous to a broker using data to target and lure potential investors. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trading-app-robinhood-settles-sec-charges-for-65-million\"><strong><em>Trading app Robinhood settles SEC charges for $65 million</em></strong></a></p><p>The proposal passed in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with Commissioner Hester Peirce dissenting alongside fellow Republican Uyeda. </p><p>As it stands, the rules updates would only apply to cryptocurrency and digital assets transactions made through a broker-dealer registered with the SEC. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/exercise-caution-crypto-asset-securities-investor-alert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According</a> to the SEC, “no crypto asset entity is registered with the SEC as a national securities exchange (like, for example, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market). And no existing national securities exchange currently trades crypto asset securities.”</p><p>Next, the updates will be <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">published</a> in the Federal Register.

If the 50-day SMA gives way, the BTC/USDT pair may tumble to $27,500 and then to $26,000.</p><p>If bulls want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly kick the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair may rise to the overhead resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,400. This zone may act as a major barrier, but if bulls overcome it, the pair may resume its uptrend.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Buyers are trying to guard the 50-day SMA ($1,853) in Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>), but they are struggling to achieve a strong rebound off it. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/4412006c-34a9-41c8-a6fb-64eaa0bb7ae9.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/nqmyl32U/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ETH/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>If the 50-day SMA support cracks, the ETH/USDT pair may start a downward move to $1,700 and subsequently to $1,626. Such a move will indicate that the pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $1,626 and $2,000 for a while longer.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-day EMA ($1,883). That may clear the path for a possible rally to $2,000. The bulls will have to overcome this obstacle to indicate the start of a new up move.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.67) on July 25, but the bulls could not build upon this strength. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b0ec09b9-ef78-4ddf-8d9c-53b3c6a9277f.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/SnwrgzgY/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">XRP/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and seize control. If they can pull it off, the XRP/USDT pair may plummet to the breakout level of $0.56. Such a deep fall may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price bounces off the 20-day EMA and rises above $0.75, it will suggest that bulls are buying the dips. The pair could then swing between the 20-day EMA and $0.86 for a few days.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) is trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating uncertainty among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/05e7f180-cd06-454b-9264-f6e0c39f1390.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/FWInTxTy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BNB/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are likely to buy the dips to the support line. If the price rises from this level and breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the BNB/USDT pair may continue its stay inside the triangle.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price dips below the triangle, it will suggest that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair could then drop to the critical support at $220. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may start the next leg of the downtrend.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) skidded below the 20-day EMA ($0.30) on July 24 and reached the strong support at $0.30. The bulls are defending this level but have failed to achieve a strong bounce off it. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/62df5c5f-8ea4-4b0a-89a9-2cbf4a5a147b.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/7CKtOpuQ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ADA/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to strengthen their position further by yanking the price below the uptrend line. If they succeed in doing that, the ADA/USDT pair could start a deeper pullback to $0.27 and then to $0.26.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns up from $0.30 or the uptrend line, it will suggest that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $0.32. That could start a recovery to $0.34, where the bears may again pose a strong challenge.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($23.80) on July 24 and reached close to the horizontal support at $22.30 on July 25.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/ebb4dc66-d8f9-42aa-a6a9-896eb7b72677.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/VwmbLUnD/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">SOL/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The bulls purchased the dip and pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA on July 26. This suggests that the SOL/USDT pair may oscillate between $22.30 and $27.12 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory also point to a possible consolidation in the near term.</p><p>The next trending move is likely to begin after the bulls thrust the price above $27.12 or the bears sink the pair below $22.30.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) turned up from $0.07 on July 23, indicating that the bulls have flipped the level into support. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/fde5d0d3-5db2-416b-8fbd-0ef9da04efa3.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/pLBHXuFo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DOGE/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The up move picked up momentum on July 25 and reached the first target objective near $0.08. This level may attract sellers, but if the bulls do not give up much ground, the DOGE/USDT pair may soar to $0.10 and then to $0.11.</p><p>If bears want to prevent the up move, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the breakout level of $0.07. Such a move will suggest that the recent breakout may have been a bull trap.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-foundation-to-sue-blockone-on-failure-to-honor-one-billion-commitment\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/eos-foundation-to-sue-blockone-on-failure-to-honor-one-billion-commitment/amp\"><strong><em>EOS Foundation to sue Block.one on failure to honor $1B commitment</em></strong></a></p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) plunged and closed below the uptrend line on July 25. The bulls are attempting to arrest the pullback at the 50-day SMA ($0.69). </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/4471478c-0024-4aa7-9dc6-b7e7971bd6d5.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/cdps8iQW/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MATIC/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>If the price breaks and closes above the 20-day EMA ($0.73), it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. The MATIC/USDT pair may then rise to $0.80. This level may again act as a stiff hurdle, but if bulls clear it, the pair could reach $0.90.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on relief rallies. That will increase the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA. The pair may then start a deeper correction toward $0.60.</p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($92) on July 24 and plunged below the 50-day SMA ($90). The bulls are trying to push the price back above the 50-day SMA, but the bears have held their ground.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b57b65d2-4af6-4044-b17c-b06f82b220d8.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/9nnJsk5D/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LTC/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the bears are in charge. If the price turns down and breaks below $87, the LTC/USDT pair may resume its descent toward $81. This level may attract buyers.</p><p>On the upside, the bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to signal a comeback. The pair may first rise to $96 and thereafter attempt a rally to the overhead resistance of $106.</p><h3>Polkadot price analysis</h3><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) has been range-bound between the 50-day SMA ($5.04) and the overhead resistance of $5.64 for the past few days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/33c03476-6068-49bd-9be8-a6069857dda2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/Feu2asae/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DOT/USDT</a> daily chart. Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>After failing to sustain above the resistance of the range on July 21, the DOT/USDT pair slipped back to the support on July 24. The bulls successfully held the 50-day SMA but are struggling to propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.25). </p><p>If the price turns down from the current level, the likelihood of a break below the 50-day SMA increases. That could sink the pair to $4.74 and next to $4.65. Alternatively, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may extend its consolidation for a few more days.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

To get a World ID, one needs to have their iris scanned by a company&rsquo;s device called Orb at one of the offered locations.</p>\n<p>So far, Worldcoin made their Orbs available in 35 cities across 20 different countries, with&nbsp; 124 open locations in total. According to the data of the first project&rsquo;s day, the largest number of people visiting Orbs was registered in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>It was reported that around 600 people visited Orbs (200 per one of the three locations) in Hong Kong on Monday, with at least another 500 showing up on Tuesday. Heatherm Huang, co-founder of the Measurable Data Token blockchain firm, one of the three Orb operators in Hong Kong, said that nearly half of the total sign-ups for Worldcoin on Monday was recorded in Hong Kong. That means that around 1,000 people in total had their iris scanned by an Orb on the Worldcoin&rsquo;s launch day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Compared to the number of 2 million pre-signups for World ID which was achieved on July 13, 1,000 Orb visits on the opening day doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot, although it might be too early to draw any conclusions.</p>\n<p>To encourage more users to register for World ID, the company even promised to give away 25 WLD (equivalent to around 60 USD at the time of writing) to anyone who visits an Orb. So, after getting their iris scanned, one can get both a World ID and 25 WLD in their World App wallet.</p>\nWorldcoin Faces Criticism&nbsp;\n<p>Despite all the perks and seemingly good intentions behind the project, Worldcoin has received its share of backlash lately. Many have expressed their concerns over the level of privacy and security World ID can offer.</p>\n<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin named four main risks related to the Worldcoin&rsquo;s system, while the UK watchdogs said they would be &ldquo;making further enquiries&rdquo; regarding the project.</p>\nWLD Awaits a Catalyst to Gain Value&nbsp;\n<p>The WLD token started off at a price of $3.3 on Monday, dropped to $2.1 on the next day, and still hasn&rsquo;t grown much since then. It looks like the coin needs a push to surpass its $3 mark again. WLD is currently trading at $2.33 according to CoinMarketCap.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p>Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) are two cryptocurrencies that have been through ups and downs. While their price movement sometimes isn&rsquo;t quite stable, investors switched to the new Pomerdoge (POMD) token. Pomerdoge (POMD) is a revolutionary P2E game and is the next largest meme coin. One of the best forecasts is that it will surge by 4,000%!</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;BUY POMD TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>\nSolana (SOL) Works with Coca-Cola\n<p>Solana (SOL) has been on a bearish run over the previous month because the Solana (SOL) token wasn&rsquo;t able to break the resistance level of $20. This was mainly because of negative market conditions. </p>\n<p>On a more positive note, Solana (SOL) partnered with Coca-Cola in Serbia in order to work on an NFT, which has been offered at a large music event. Due to this, Solana (SOL) gained a lot of attention. As a result, Solana (SOL) records a 10.45% increase, and currently, the price of the Solana (SOL) token stands at $22.18.</p>\n<p>According to crypto experts, if Solana (SOL) makes a breakthrough among foreign investors and stays over $20, then it will remain on a bullish run for a long while. They even forecast that Solana (SOL) will reach $25.56 by the end of 2023.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;BUY POMD TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>\nTron (TRX) Sends 23,000 ETH to Poloniex\n<p>After Tron (TRX) spent a lot of time on a bearish run due to negative market conditions, it looks like the Tron (TRX) token is finally on an upward trajectory. </p>\n<p>In the last 24 hours, the founder of Tron (TRX), Justin Sun, transferred 23,000 Ethereum tokens worth $43 million to Poloniex. Because of this, Tron (TRX) got a price increase of 1.03%, and it now costs $0.07891. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Tron (TRX) trajectory is still not consistent. Therefore, analysts state that it is possible for Tron (TRX) to drop again. However, if Tron (TRX) continues to grow, it may get a new price barrier in the upcoming week, which is quite positive. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;BUY POMD TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>\nPomerdoge (POMD) Leaves Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) in the Dust\n<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) is a new P2E game that already got a lot of investors&rsquo; attention. This game promises a lot of fun, along with amazing gains. Pomerdoge (POMD) aims to unite the positive aspects of competitors into a unique product. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, Pomerdoge (POMD) has successfully undergone audits by Interfi Network and SOLIDProof. Thanks to this, you will be able to play the game in September. The exciting Pomergame will also connect players worldwide, helping them upgrade their Pomerdoge(POMD) characters and create customized items for their POMD avatars. </p>\n<p>Besides this, Pomerdoge (POMD) will enable you to buy, sell, and trade items, skins, and many other objects that the Pomerplace market holds. More so, POMD&rsquo;s Pomerplace will also come with a battle arena where Pomerdoge (POMD) holders can get better rewards by testing the strengths of their avatars. </p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, a lot of crypto analysts call Pomerdoge (POMD) &lsquo;the biggest meme-coin of 2023.&rsquo; This is because the Pomerdoge (POMD) token is currently worth $0.0000264. As most experienced investors know, investing early in solid projects is where significant gains are often made. In other words, if you invest now, you have the chance to experience the 4,000% surge of Pomerdoge (POMD) by the end of the year. </p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not all! The Pomerdoge (POMD) token offers access to the collection of 7,777 NFTs that should be launched during June and July. In addition, you can even get a revenue percentage. Moreover, you can engage in $100,000 weekly giveaways that will take place in Pomerdoge&rsquo;s Telegram group. </p>\n<p>The best part is that you only need to connect your crypto wallet and use ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or BUSD to become part of the Pomerdoge (POMD) family. We believe this could be an opportunity to get into an exciting cryptocurrency at a perfect price point!</p>\nFor more information about the Pomerdoge (POMD) presale:\n<p>Click Here For Website</p>\n<p>Click Here To Buy POMD Presale Tokens</p>\n<p>Join Our Community on Telegram</p>\n<p class=\"s10\">Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Block.one, a significant investor in the blockchain industry, is now under fire from the EOS Network Foundation (ENF) for purportedly defaulting on its $1 billion investment commitment.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">ENF's CEO, Yves La Rose, recently announced the foundation's preparation to file a lawsuit against Block.one, adding to the growing list of legal actions the latter faces.</p>\nAccusations and Previous Lawsuits\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">In a July 25 Twitter thread, La Rose informed that Block.one is already negotiating a settlement for another class-action lawsuit, with a proposed amount of $22 million. The firm had previously tried to settle at $27.5 million with the lead plaintiff, Crypto Assets Opportunity, but a U.S. judge turned it down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">&ldquo;You may need to opt out to be eligible to participate in the ENF&rsquo;s lawsuit,&rdquo; La Rose noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Plaintiffs considering opting out of the class-action suit, which was initiated in 2017 and is currently in settlement process, have been advised to contact counsel James Koutoulas. The deadline to claim or opt out is set for Aug. 23, as stated by La Rose. He emphasized, however, that opting out doesn't guarantee a successful claim against Block.one in any other lawsuit.</p>\nPromise vs. Delivery\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">La Rose alleges that Block.one's inability to fulfill its commitment to the EOS Network and community has resulted in significant challenges for the  . ENF, in response, has reportedly been actively collaborating with stakeholders to ensure Block.one is held accountable for its promises.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">These allegations aren't entirely new. In May 2023, La Rose first raised the call for a class-action lawsuit against Block.one, accusing it of breaching its commitment to channel $1 billion from EOS&rsquo; initial coin offering (ICO) to EOSIO developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">&ldquo;It was broadly understood at the time that B1 was making these commitments that these investments would be made in the EOS Network, [...] and yet B1 has provided minimal real support to EOS Network efforts to develop the network,&rdquo; La Rose wrote. &ldquo;B1&rsquo;s promises during the ICO and after have not been fulfilled,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Block.one raised a staggering $4.1 billion in an ICO back in 2018, setting a record for one of the largest crowdfunding rounds of the time. Block.one hasn't yet responded to these latest accusations from the ENF.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Despite the looming legal battles, La Rose remains confident about the potential of the EOS Network. In a tweet, he affirmed that taking steps to hold Block.one accountable for its promises would only enhance EOS Network&rsquo;s position and the long-term value it offers its participants.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/this-amd-ryzen-bug-compromise-crypto-wallet-keys/",
    "description": "A new bug called &#8220;Zenbleed&#8221; affecting specific AMD CPUs has been found that can potentially leak info, such as keys attached to crypto wallets. AMD Zenbleed May Be Exploited To Leak Crypto Wallet Keys As reported by the computer-focused news website Tom&#8217;s Hardware, a new vulnerability related to AMD CPUs has been discovered that can compromise sensitive info such as passwords and encryption keys. This bug was independently found by Travis Ormandy, a Google Information Security researcher, who has now made public a documentation of this vulnerability. The Zenbleed exploit works on all products that use AMD&#8217;s &#8220;Zen 2&#8221; architecture. Tom&#8217;s Hardware notes that even the AMD EPYC processors in data centers aren&#8217;t free from this vulnerability. With this bug, a malicious hacker can potentially get locked information through the CPU and be able to access the user&#8217;s login credentials. Naturally, this also means that the keys of a crypto wallet, if installed on the same hardware, may no longer be safe. This vulnerability is so powerful that the attacker doesn&#8217;t require physical access to the PC or server; it can be executed through javascript on a webpage, like that inside an ad. AMD has released a new security advisory about Zenbleed that breaks down when the different patches may be released for its various products. According to this information, the consumer CPUs from the Ryzen 3000 and 4000 series, and some from the 5000 line, will not get appropriate fixes until November and December of this year. This would suggest that these home-computer processors might not be protected until the end of the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Only Slips Further Despite Price Decline &#8220;AMD&#8217;s processors used in the PS5, Xbox Series X, and S, and Steam Deck are all also powered by Zen 2 chips, but it remains unclear if those are impacted,&#8221; explains Tom&#8217;s Hardware. Which Digital Asset Wallets Would Be Affected? Any crypto wallets the user would directly install on their PC could be vulnerable to this exploit. However, keys stored on dedicated devices like hardware wallets should be safe. Encryption keys stored on locked-down computers (that is, those disconnected from the internet) should also be unaffected by the vulnerability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Red, US Institutions Disinterested? Recently, there has been a push towards self-custody in the crypto sector, as investors have slowly become aware of the risks related to centralized platforms after established players such as FTX have gone down during the past year. However, Bugs like these showcase that although self-custodial wallets may be safer than keeping coins on centralized platforms, some types are less safer than others. For example, the hot wallets that need to be connected to the internet can potentially fall prey to such vulnerabilities. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,300, down 2% in the last week.

    "description": "The Bitcoin price has been underwhelming in the past few days, reflecting the current state of the cryptocurrency market. On Monday, July 24, investors watched the price of the premier cryptocurrency retreat beneath the $30,000 mark again.  Let&#8217;s look at what the on-chain metrics say about this latest fall below the critical price level.  69% Of Bitcoin Holders In Profit After Fall Below $30,000 A data report from IntoTheBlock reveals that roughly 68.96% of Bitcoin holders remained green after the price retreat below the $30,000 mark. There is also an indication of significant buying activity around this price level, with more than 3.4 million wallets acquiring BTC at this zone. Source: IntoTheBlock via Twitter According to the market intelligence platform, the $30,000 mark has often served as a psychological support level for investors. However, it remains to be seen whether traders will hold or opt out of their positions if the coin continues its current bearish form. Interestingly, on-chain data reveals that BTC’s volatility is currently at its historical low, suggesting that a significant price movement is imminent.  Related Reading: Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed? Bitcoin currently trades at $29,225, with a slight 0.4% price increase in the past day, according to CoinGecko data. A look at its broader market reveals that the coin has been on a 5% price decline in the past two weeks. Since falling below the $30,000 mark on July 24, the price of Bitcoin is yet to recover above this level as it often has in recent times. Bitcoin Experiences Increased Network Growth And Activity While the recurrent price dip below $30,000 in July may have raised some concern amongst investors, there are positive signs demonstrating Bitcoin’s resilience and overall stability. For instance, the creation of new addresses recently hit a yearly high, suggesting increased user growth, which might positively influence the coin’s price. IntoTheBlock’s New Adoption Rate metric further fuels the optimism around Bitcoin. This metric measures the ratio of new active addresses compared to total activity.  According to the analytics platform, there was a sudden spike in the new adoption rate of Bitcoin in July. For context, this rate has been in a range for most of 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Recover But Upsides Might Be Attractive To Bears Moreover, Bitcoin’s transaction volume has been relatively healthy, despite initial concerns about a potential decline following the Ordinals&#8217; frenzy in Q2 2023.  However, Bitcoin&#8217;s NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio is unusually high. According to Glassnode, an NVT ratio describes the relationship between the market cap and transfer volume, with a high value often suggesting overvaluation and bearish sentiment.
