    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/new-era-for-vechain-marketplace-platform-unveiled-price-spike-looming/",
    "description": "In a new development, VeChain (VET) has announced the introduction of its latest No-Code Tokenized Asset Marketplace-as-a-Service platform (MaaS), fueling optimism within the community of an impendent price uptick. The announcement also featured the collaboration of the MotoGP racing team Gresini Racing as its first enterprise client. By collaborating with Gresini Racing, an enormous fan base will be offered digital collectibles through the MaaS platform. VeChain To Onboard A Rapid Tokenizing World With the launch of its No-Code Tokenized Asset Marketplace (MaaS) platform, VeChain has made tremendous progress toward increasing mass adoption of blockchain technology. VeChain&#8217;s continuous goal to promote widespread blockchain technology adoption by removing technological hurdles is consistent with this user-friendly strategy. Since its founding, VeChain has created several use cases powered by blockchain applications. These include product authentification, creating new digital communication channels, provenance and sustainability traceability, and others. This demonstrates its understanding of the tremendous potential that its technologies have for Web 3. Related Reading: Big Banks Push for More Bitcoin (BTC) Exposure, VeChain (VET) and NuggetRush (NUGX) Lead the Top Gainers Given the rise in demand for tokenizing Real-World assets (RWAs) solutions, the introduction of MaaS seems appropriate. Furthermore, NFC functionality and support for &#8220;Phygitals,&#8221; or real-world physical assets with NFT/digital counterparts, will be added later in the platform.  Specifically, this innovation was created to significantly influence the digital asset market. It aims to provide enterprise and individual builders with an &#8220;easy-to-use white-label NFT platform for digital asset sales&#8221; and transfers that require little to no programming. MaaS applications are diverse and address the increasing need for platforms that enable asset tokenization. Blackrock&#8216;s latest application for a Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization fund highlighted this path.  So far, the No-Code Tokenized Asset Marketplace-as-a-Service platform (MaaS) is expected to be fully operational later this year. VET Is On A Downtrend  Despite the launch of MaaS, VeChain (VET) is witnessing a daily downtrend of nearly 2%. However, in the weekly timeframe, the crypto asset has increased by over 5%, suggesting an upward move.  Related Reading: VeChain Ready For Big Moves: Analyst Identifies Key Factors That Will Drive VET To New ATH As of the time of writing, VET was trading at $0.0440, with its market cap dropping by 2.78% in the past day. Meanwhile, its trading volume is down by about 24% in the last 24 hours. In August 2018, during a downside trend in the cryptocurrency market, VET made its market debut. However, following the 2021 bull run, VET rose to the top, peaking at $0.281 before the cycle ended. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"
