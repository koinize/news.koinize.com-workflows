    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ltc/litecoin-will-it-sustain-above-60/",
    "description": "Litecoin (LTC) has found itself in a tight consolidation phase, firmly locked within the $60 to $70 range since mid-August. Despite several attempts to break above the $70 resistance level, bulls seem to be running low on aggressiveness. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, LTC is trading at $62.99, reflecting a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours and a seven-day slump of 3.1%. In recent weeks, LTC bulls have diligently defended the August 2022 range-high of $63, preventing a drop below this crucial support level. However, their efforts to push the price beyond $70 have proved futile.  Related Reading: Stellar Tough Spot: Will XLM Prices See A Dip Amid Mid-Range Struggles? Litecoin Bulls Defend Key Levels But Face Technical Challenges A closer look at the technical indicators reveals that the H12 bearish order book and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are posing significant challenges for the bulls. Analysts believe that Litecoin could continue its consolidation above the $63 range-high in the coming hours or days. Still, the prevailing bearish pressure could hinder any substantial upward movement in the near term. LTC&#8217;s Struggle Amid Growing On-Chain Activity Surprisingly, despite Litecoin&#8217;s price consolidation, its on-chain data has shown increased activity in its ecosystem. According to a separate report, over the past four months, the share of Litecoin in global cryptocurrency payments has surged by an impressive 21%.  This suggests that despite the stagnant price, Litecoin remains a popular choice for transactions. Litecoin market cap currently at $4.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Sell Limit Orders And Bearish Sentiments To complicate matters further for LTC, order flow tracking platform Mobchart cited in an analysis significant sell limit orders at $66 (3.11k LTC) and $70 (3.26k LTC) on Binance Exchange&#8217;s spot market.  These levels are strategically positioned between the H4 50-EMA and the H12 bearish order book, effectively forming a formidable barrier for Litecoin&#8217;s price to overcome. This adds to the growing challenges faced by LTC bulls in their quest to push the price higher. LTC seven-day price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, sentiment around Litecoin has been increasingly bearish in recent times, as indicated by a separate report revealing that LTC bears have strengthened by 19% in the past week. This surge in bearish sentiment has likely contributed to the current downward pressure on LTC&#8217;s price.

Litecoin (LTC) remains trapped within the $60 to $70 range, with technical indicators and significant sell orders acting as obstacles to any substantial price movement. Despite on-chain activity showing promise, growing bearish sentiments continue to weigh on LTC&#8217;s price, making it a challenging period for Litecoin investors and enthusiasts.
