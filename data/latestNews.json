    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-bad-news/",
    "description": "Amidst the debate on the XRP price future trajectory, the CEO of Evai Crypto Ratings, Matthew Dixon, has provided insights into the token‚Äôs direction using the Elliot Wave Theory. However, his analysis doesn‚Äôt provide any relief to XRP holders as he projects a further decline for the token and its ecosystem. How XRP Price Is Looking On The Charts In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dixon shared a price chart of XRP dating back to July, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of his analysis, he noted that XRP aligned with the BTC outlook.¬† Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies 6 Overlooked Altcoins That Could Be Due For A Price Surge Source: X (formerly Twitter) Looking at the chart, he highlighted the bearish divergence, which indicated that the 5th wave was expected to cause a decline in the XRP price. However, before then, he projected that there is a likelihood of the token experiencing an upward trend to complete wave 4.¬† While Dixon‚Äôs analysis suggests a bearish outlook, he quickly noted that nothing was certain in technical analysis, although there is a high probability of this happening.¬† The Elliot Wave Theory, which he used to come to this conclusion, is a popular technical analysis indicator used to predict future price trends. The theory propounds that markets like XRP follow predictable sequences of optimism and pessimism driven by investor sentiment and psychology. Simply put, it agrees with the trend that there will always be a correction or retracement after a particular trend (upward or downward). XRP sitting at $0.48 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Time To Lower Expectations Many crypto analysts have made far-fetched predictions of the XRP price, with one, in particular, stating that the token could rise as high as $10,000. However, a crypto influencer (Crypto Assets Guy) advised those in the XRP community to lower their expectations as the token won‚Äôt hit ‚Äú$10,000, $1,000, $50‚Äù or even $10 any time soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Gearing Up For Rebound As Whales Make Their Move He took a more conservative stance by stating that the token could hit a new all-time high late this year or in 2024, suggesting it could add around $3.70 to its current all-time high of $3.84. He believes the XRP community should be more than satisfied if that happens.¬† Meanwhile, many in the XRP community seem tired of these price predictions. This was evident when some expressed frustration after XRP influencer Jack The Rippler posted the headline of an article (dated July 31, 2023), which stated that a Wells Fargo staff had predicted the XRP price to hit $100 to $500 in the next 2 to 7 months.¬† One particular X user stated, ‚ÄúBla bla bla evey [every] goddamn day the same shit.‚Äù Bla bla bla evey goddamn day the same shit ‚Äî rovadi ìÑø (@RoVaDi2001) October 10, 2023 Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"
