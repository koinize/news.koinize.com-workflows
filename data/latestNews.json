    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/realistic-xrp-price-13-and-39/",
    "description": "The future of the XRP price has been a hot topic of contention among crypto analysts for a while now. Most of these analyses focus on the possible movements of the price as the bull market unfolds, as well as possible price targets. In the same vein, crypto analyst CryptoBull has presented their own bull case for the altcoin, giving the most realistic price targets. Long Time Price Channel Shows Realistic Price In the analyst CryptoBull posted on X (formerly Twitter), he shows the historical price movement of the altcoin going as far back as 2014. The analyst uses this to deduce the possible trajectory of the XRP price in the coming months using the XRP price channel. Related Reading: Bitwise CEO Says Bitcoin At $250,000 Is Closer Than You Think According to CryptoBull, using this data, the most realistic price for the altcoin currently sits somewhere between $13 and $39. ”The long-term price channel shows the most realistic #XRP price between $13 and $39 in the coming months!” CryptoBull stated. The long term price channel shows the most realistic #XRP price between $13 and $39 in the coming months! pic.twitter.com/iuePJitybs — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 29, 2024 While the lower end of this channel of $13 was more realistic, the upper end of $39 has drawn criticism from the community. In response to CryptoBull’s prediction, another X user, Ben McClymans, said it was “crazy talk.” This is because for XRP’s price to reach $39 per coin, then its market cap would have to be larger than that of Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market. However, other community members jumped to the defense of XRP, reminding Ben that the market cap of XRP had actually flipped Ethereum before. Given this, they believe that it is possible that it will end up flipping to Ethereum once again. XRP Price Performance Worries Investors The XRP price performance over the last few years has worried investors because while other altcoins were hitting new all-time highs, XRP continued to struggle. However, this is understandable given that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple in 2020, which adversely affected XRP’s performance. Related Reading: Solana On A Roll: Crypto Analyst Predicts Push To $600 The XRP price had crashed off the back of the announcement alone and did not recover as well as expected. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, though, as the lawsuit with the SEC seems to be coming to an end. The court looks to be leaning toward a settlement, which would put an end to the case once and for all. To get an idea of what could happen with the XRP price when the lawsuit is over, we can take a look at what happened when Ripple secured a partial victory over the SEC in 2023. After Judge Analisa Torres declared that XRP programmatic sales did not qualify as securities, XRP jumped more than 60% in a single day. The lawsuit is currently the biggest hindrance to the XRP price performance, and expectations are that the price will surge once it’s over. If it does so, then CryptoBull’s prediction could end up playing out. XRP trending at $0.58 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com"
