The platform was originally rolled out to a small percentage of users but is now available to around 97% of users. Google said the remaining 3% will be <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">onboarded</a> over the next few months.</p><p>Privacy experts have criticized the new tracking system. But in its announcement, Google defended it, stating that Privacy Sandbox needs to be implemented to eliminate third-party cookies and fingerprinting.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"> Google is introducing Privacy Sandbox to Chrome users, replacing third-party cookies with more privacy-centric tracking of topics of interest. However, concerns arise about transparency and data collection.

To target ads to readers effectively, Adsense embeds cookies in the user’s browser. These cookies track users’ behavior as they browse from site to site, gathering data that can be used to determine what products they may be interested in buying. Because these cookies are produced by Google rather than the website being visited, they are often called “third-party cookies.”</p><p>Some competing ad platforms such as Microsoft Ads also use third-party cookies.</p><p>Privacy advocates have criticized the practice of embedding third-party cookies, and some users have sought ways to block them. Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox and Brave’s Brave browser have all implemented blocks on third-party cookies by default. Chrome users can also choose to block these cookies through the settings menu.</p><p>In a January 2020 blog post, Google <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">argued</a> that browsers should not block third-party cookies by default until an alternative tracking system is created. “Some browsers have reacted to these concerns by blocking third-party cookies,” the post said, “but we believe this has unintended consequences that can negatively impact both users and the web ecosystem.” </p><p>According to Google, blocking third-party cookies may lead to “[encouraging] the use of opaque techniques such as fingerprinting (an invasive workaround to replace cookies), which can actually reduce user privacy and control.”</p><p>The Sept. 7 announcement echoes these earlier statements, claiming:</p><blockquote>“Without viable privacy-preserving alternatives to third-party cookies, such as the Privacy Sandbox, we risk reducing access to information for all users, and incentivizing invasive tactics such as fingerprinting.”</blockquote><p>Google Chrome’s new Privacy Sandbox platform allows user data to be tracked within the browser itself. For this reason, Google believes it will enhance privacy, as it will do away with the need for third-party cookies. However, Google also emphasized that it will not start blocking third-party cookies by default until a later date.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-ads-child-data-tracking-response\"><strong>Google responds to accusations of ads tracking data of children</strong></a></em></p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy advocacy group, argued that an earlier version of the Privacy Sandbox did little to enhance privacy, as it <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">continued</a> to track users’ behavior, albeit within the browser instead of through cookies.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dips-below-25000-as-former-paypal-president-hails-it-as-universal-internet-currency/",
    "description": "In an interview with CNBC on Monday, David Marcus, former President of Paypal and Head of Facebook Payments, expressed his belief that Bitcoin (BTC) is the universal protocol for money on the internet.  He emphasized Bitcoin&#8217;s significance as the flagship cryptocurrency and its core value as a payment solution while discussing its potential as a global payment network. Bitcoin As The Universal Protocol For Internet Money Despite enduring a challenging period and navigating various headwinds in recent months, Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market. According to Marcus, Bitcoin&#8217;s prominence is not solely due to its market position but is also driven by its ability to serve as a universal protocol for internet money. Related Reading: Lost In Transaction: Bitcoin User Overpaid By $500,000 For A $200 Deal Marcus highlighted the absence of a universal protocol for value transfer on the internet, stating, &#8220;There&#8217;s no universal protocol for money on the internet that enables value to be transported.&#8221;  He explained that the vision is to transform Bitcoin into a global payment network, providing a seamless and efficient means of transferring value across borders. One of the advantages Marcus cited for Bitcoin is its availability and accessibility. Unlike traditional financial systems, where individuals may face fees and the need to visit a branch during limited hours, Bitcoin operates 24/7.  This inherent characteristic of Bitcoin allows for greater convenience and flexibility, enabling users to transact at any time, including weekends. While acknowledging Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a payment network, Marcus noted that its primary function may not be as a currency for everyday purchases. He stated, &#8220;Our view is that BTC is not the currency people will use to buy things.&#8221;  However, he emphasized Bitcoin&#8217;s role as the universal protocol for money on the Internet, enabling secure and efficient value transfer across various digital platforms. As Bitcoin continues to gain attention and recognition, Marcus&#8217;s endorsement further solidifies its position as the flagship cryptocurrency and reinforces its potential as the universal protocol for internet money.  BTC Trading Volume Hits Lowest Level Since 2019  According to Satoshi Club data, Bitcoin is experiencing a significant slump in its daily trading volume, reaching its lowest point since February 2019 at just $5.4 billion.  This decline has been attributed to a lack of market enthusiasm following the collapse of FTX. Furthermore, Bitcoin&#8217;s price dipped to $24,900 on Monday, the lowest level since June, exacerbating concerns about a potential extended decline shortly. The dwindling daily trading volume of Bitcoin indicates a prevailing apathy among traders, with reduced participation and a lack of significant buy or sell activity. This trend is reminiscent of the market sentiment observed after the collapse of FTX, which has had a lingering impact on investor confidence. Of particular concern is that Bitcoin&#8217;s price dropped to $24,900 on Monday, reflecting a downward trend that has persisted since BTC reached its annual high of $31,800 on July 14.  This decline has intensified worries among market participants about the possibility of a prolonged downward trajectory for Bitcoin in the coming weeks.
