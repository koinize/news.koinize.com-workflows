    "description": "<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) underscored its views that crypto requires &ldquo;comprehensive policies to safeguard economies and investors.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a blog recently in which it clarifies that investors and economies will only be adequately protected by comprehensive crypto policies.</p>\n<p>The IMFs policy suggestion comes amid a global push for clear guidelines for crypto assets under the Indian G20 Presidency.</p>\nGlobal Crypto Regulation on G20&rsquo;s Agenda\n<p>The collapse of some of the biggest crypto platforms in 2022 highlighted the dire need for establishing clear guidelines and policies for the industry to protect investors against the implications of a mostly unregulated industry.</p>\n<p>The sheer loss and impact of the implosion of the crypto trading platform FTX and the Terra Luna stablecoin made it clear that the risk of fraud and misconduct could be disastrous for investors without comprehensive safeguards.</p>\n<p>As such, the Group of 20 Nations (G20) directed its efforts to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place.</p>\n<p>Regulatory bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) have issued recommendations to develop a global framework for crypto-assets, with further guidance expected from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).</p>\n<p>The IMF subsequently made its contribution to establishing such a regulatory framework.</p>\nThree-Pillared Approach\n<p>The reality of an evolving financial system is that digitization of currencies and assets is inevitable, and the likelihood of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins replacing official currencies is increasing. To address the impact of such financial changes on countries&rsquo; monetary and fiscal policies, a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated policy approach to crypto is needed.</p>\n<p>The IMF assessed the potential macro-financial implications of the widespread adoption of CBDCs and relies on three aspects in its approach to a global regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>The IMF developed its approach on three key aspects: &ldquo;a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules, and effective implementation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The bank developed a few key policy recommendations based on these three pillars.</p>\n<p>First, protecting against substituting sovereign currencies will depend on maintaining robust, trusted, credible domestic institutions. To address crypto assets&rsquo; challenges effectively, &ldquo;transparent, consistent, and coherent monetary policy frameworks&rdquo; are imperative.</p>\n<p>The IMF suggests to protect national sovereignty; crypto assets should not be granted the status of official currency or legal tender.</p>\n<p>The IMF&rsquo;s third recommendation addresses the volatility of capital flows associated with crypto. The bank believes policymakers should integrate crypto within their existing regimes and rules for managing capital flows. Doing so will help ensure stability and minimize potential disruptions.</p>\n<p>The IMF&rsquo;s final recommendation is tax policies &ldquo;should ensure unambiguous treatment of crypto assets, and administrators should strengthen compliance efforts.&rdquo; The IMF argues specific regulations to clarify the tax treatment of crypto are necessary.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xlm/stellar-xlm-surges-over-43-in-one-week-whats-pushing-it/",
    "description": "While Bitcoin price recedes from the $30,000 support, payment solutions Stellar (XLM) and XRP continue riding the bullish wave, with Stellar (XLM) outranking top gainers today amid impressive ecosystem developments. Determined to break all barriers to the $0.2 target, XLM painted all charts green, with a whopping 43.29% gain in value on the week. The cross-border payment facilitator has added over 8.79% to its valuation over the past 24-hour trading session. XLM Rides On Bullish Momentum From Impressive Ecosystem Developments Following ecosystem developments, XLM continues to soar as interest in its innovative payment and remittance solution increase. In a recent development, Stellar partnered with MoneyGram and HoneyCoin app to support global digital assets cash out with USDC across Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and the UK. Related Reading: Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? In another announcement, Stellar partnered with Fonbnk to provide payment solutions to the unbanked in Africa. Considering that millions of Africans lack access to banking services, Stellar&#8217;s partnership with MoneyGram and Fonbnk could bring more users to the digital finance landscape, further expanding the crypto industry. Moreover, Stellar is now available on multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and Polygon, through Allbridge’s interoperability and bridge solution. Announced on July 11, the integration marks a significant milestone for Stellar, demonstrating its utility for innovative opportunities in decentralized finance. This feat could be among the factors pushing XLM&#8217;s price over the past seven days. Again, the token still enjoys the bullish wave of its close relative, XRP&#8217;s victory in the SEC/Ripple lawsuit.  Stellar (XLM) Price Movement In The Last Seven Days Over the past seven days, XLM witnessed a significant shoot-up. On July 13, when news of Ripple (XRP)’s victory broke out, XLM’s price went from $0.096 to $0.153, a 60% boost within 24 hours. Though it experienced a minute correction as the buzz subsided, XLM remains bullish, fighting for more gains to surpass $0.1 and claim $0.2.  CoinMarketCap data shows XLM has surged more than 42% in the last seven days, bringing its value over 73% higher than it was 30 days ago. As of 6:19 AM EST on July 19, XLM&#8217;s price had added more than 21% to its past year&#8217;s value. The token’s growth in value is reflected in its over 11,173% rise from its November 18, 2014, all-time low of $0.001227.  Stellar’s spree of cross-border payment partnerships has undoubtedly improved XLM’s trading activity. The coin&#8217;s trading volume currently surpasses $321 million, with a 130% increase in 24-hour trading volume, according to CoinMarketcap.  Related Reading: XRP Price Resumes Rally – Here’s Why It Could Surpass $1 This Time An increase in trading volume often points toward two factors: large selloffs and high demand or buying pressure. However, in Stellar&#8217;s case, the price resurgence shows the bulls (buyers) are at work and may push prices near $0.2 if they persist. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com"
