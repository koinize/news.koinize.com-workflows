A New York court will decide his fate.</p>\n                    <p><p>Cointelegraph reporters are on the ground in New York for the trial of former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried. As the saga unfolds, check below for the latest updates.</p><h3>Oct. 4: DOJ and Bankman-Fried's defense state their arguments</h3><p>The first hours of Sam Bankman-Fried trial have offered a glimpse of the arguments the Department of Justice (DOJ) and his defense will bring to court in the coming weeks.</p><p>After a jury selection in the morning, both parties gave opening statements to the 12-person jury present in the court.</p><p>The DOJ took a tough stance against Bankman-Fried in its first statement, portraying the FTX founder as someone who deliberately lied to investors to enrich himself and expand his crypto empire.</p><p>According to the DOJ, Bankman-Fried lied to FTX customers and investors, using Alameda as a key partner to “steal customers' funds,” a phrase that was frequently used during the opening statements.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/1004794e-c2f7-4865-9c1b-39a97e4c06f2.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A sign outside Sam Bankman-Fried's trial location in New York. Source: Ana Paula Pereira/Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>As per the trial preview, the DOJ will focus its arguments on allegations that Bankman-Fried misled customers, investors, and lenders regarding the safety of their funds while using Alameda to steal their money and influence politicians in Washington.</p><p>The defense, meanwhile, brought arguments about Bankman-Fried being a young entrepreneur who made business decisions that “didn’t work out.” The defense denied the existence of secret transactions between Alameda and FTX, or a backdoor used to steal customer funds. According to the previous arguments presented, all transactions were legitimate or made in good faith by Bankman-Fried during the crypto market downturn and the subsequent collapse of FTX in November 2022.</p><p>The defense also highlighted the role of Binance in the bank run that led to FTX’s collapse. Testimonies will continue throughout the day.</p><p>According to the defense, Bankman-Fried assumed FTX was allowed to loan funds to Alameda as part of a business relationship with the market maker, and there was no secret door for transactions between the companies.</p><p>Prosecutors also noted that Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh will offer the jury insider details about Bankman-Fried’s role in FTX’s operations and alleged crimes. However, the defense pointed out that as part of the cooperation agreement with the government, they were supposed to give testimony against Bankman-Fried, raising doubts about their credibility.</p><p>The defense also downplayed the accusations against the nature of the relationship between FTX and Alameda, arguing that FTX margin traders were aware of the risks associated with transactions.</p><p>“There was no theft,” the defense claimed. “It's not a crime to be the CEO of a company that files for bankruptcy.”</p><p>In the second half of the first day of the trial, the jury heard from two witnesses: Mark Julliard, a French trader and former client of FTX, and Adam Yedidia, a friend of Sam Bankman-Fried and former employee at Alameda Research and FTX.</p><p>In his testimony, Julliard said he had four Bitcoin held at FTX at the time of the exchange’s collapse, worth nearly $100,000. He admitted that FTX and Bankman-Fried’s marketing efforts, along with notable venture capital companies backing FTX, gave him the confidence to use the exchange for crypto trading. He assumed that VC firms had run due diligence on FTX and its leadership.</p><p>During the questioning, prosecutors emphasized that the trader used FTX exclusively for spot trading and that he was not aware that the exchange was using client funds for crypto trading with Alameda Research.</p><p>Questions for Yedidia were focused on his educational background at MIT, where he first met Bankman-Fried, and his two professional experiences with the FTX founder. Yedidia worked at Alameda for a brief period in 2017 as a trader and then came back to work for FTX in 2021 as a developer. He was one of ten people living in the Bahamas on FTX's $30 million real estate.</p><p>In Yedidia's testimony, prosecutors used former FTX ads as evidence that the company was always positioning itself as a safe, trusted, and easy way to invest in cryptocurrency, including marketing campaigns with NFL player Tom Brady and comedian Larry David. The trial will resume Oct. 5.</p><h3>Oct. 3: SBF trial begins</h3><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/2a41313e-7417-40e7-99d5-fb2eee7cb785.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bankman-Fried’s trial will take place in a Manhattan federal court. Source: Ana Paula Pereira/Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried began on Oct. 3 with jury selection. Bankman-Fried is charged with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud in connection with the collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded. He <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-s-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges-report\">has pleaded not guilty</a> to all charges. The case is being heard by Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has presided over a long list of other high-profile cases, including ones involving detainees at Guantanamo Bay, the Gambino crime family, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump.</p><p>Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-orders-sam-bankman-fried-bail-revoked-following-allegations-witness-intimidation\">was ordered to be jailed</a> on Aug. 11 after Kaplan found that his sharing of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s personal papers amounted to witness intimidation. Alameda Research was a trading house also founded by Bankman-Fried. Previously, he had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-sent-home-after-his-parents-put-up-their-house-to-cover-his-astronomical-bail-bond\">been under house arrest</a> in his parents’ home in Stanford, California on a $250-million bond.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gB1zBrqHPLw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>December: SBF arrested</h3><p>Bankman-Fried was arrested in the United States on his arrival from the Bahamas on Dec. 21, 2022. He had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-and-in-custody-attorney-general\">been arrested in the Bahamas</a> on Dec. 12 after the U.S. government formally notified the country of charges the U.S. was filing against him. He declared his intention to fight extradition from the Caribbean nation but changed his mind after a week in Bahaman jail and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-reverse-decision-on-contesting-extradition-report\">consented to extradition</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO (and reportedly sometime SBF girlfriend) Ellison <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/caroline-ellison-gary-wang-plead-guilty-to-fraud-charges\">agreed to plead guilty</a> in the burgeoning case.</p><h3>November: FTX collapses</h3><p>Bankman-Fried’s troubles began when reports emerged on Nov. 2 that Alameda Research had a large holding of FTX Token (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ftx-token-ftt-price-index\">FTT</a>), FTX’s utility token. That revelation led to questions about the relationship between the two entities. On Nov. 6, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival exchange Binance, announced that his exchange <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-to-liquidate-its-entire-ftx-token-holdings-after-recent-revelations\">would liquidate its FTT</a> holdings, which were estimated to be worth $2.1 billion. Zhao turned down an offer tweeted by Ellison to buy Binance’s FTT.</p><p>A run <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-addresses-user-withdrawal-complaints-amid-major-token-movement\">began on FTX</a>. Bankman-Fried gave reassurances on Twitter (now X) that the exchange’s “assets are fine” and accused “a competitor” of spreading rumors. By Nov. 8, the price of FTT had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-token-price-risks-30-plunge-as-a-23m-ftt-part-moves-to-binance\">fallen from $22</a> to $15.40.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It’s only been one week since SBF’s notorious “FTX is fine.

This will clear out liquidity crunches; all assets will be covered 1:1.”</p><p>On Nov. 9, Zhao announced that Binance <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-s-binance-rescue-deal-falls-apart-in-less-than-48-hours\">would not pursue the acquisition of FTX</a> after due diligence and more reports of mishandled funds. The price of Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-multi-year-low-at-15-6k-analysts-expect-further-downside\">plummeted to $15,600</a>. The FTX and Alameda Research <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/alameda-s-research-and-ftx-ventures-websites-taken-down\">websites went dark</a> for a few hours. When the FTX website came back, it bore a warning against making deposits and was unable to process withdrawals.</p><p>On Nov. 10, Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-apologizes-over-ftx-liquidity-crisis-i-fucked-up-twice\">posted a 22-part Twitter thread</a> that began with “I’m sorry.” It was the first of a long string of public statements he made about the exchange’s fall. The following day, the entire staff of Alameda Research quit, and FTX, FTX US and Alameda Research <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-ftx-us-and-alameda-file-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-us-sbf-resigns\">filed for bankruptcy in the United States</a>. Bankman-Fried resigned as FTX CEO and was replaced by John J. Ray III, who was best known for his role in the Enron bankruptcy.</p><h3>SBF and FTX before the fall</h3><p>At the beginning of 2022, FTX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-exchange-breaks-32b-valuation-despite-crypto-winter-fears\">had a $32-billion valuation</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-revenue-reportedly-grew-1000-in-one-year-leaked-documents-reveal\">was thought to be in enviable financial condition</a>. Bankman-Fried was seen as a respected business leader by much of the crypto community and the world at large. He was photographed with political leaders and <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Bankman-Fried_0209202211.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">spoke</a> at congressional <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AG/AG00/20220512/114729/HHRG-117-AG00-Wstate-Bankman-FriedS-20220512.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hearings</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Maxine Waters is chairing the investigation into FTX <a href=\"https://t.co/oFMctH4rRh\">https://t.co/oFMctH4rRh</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ox6O5w4nOl\">pic.twitter.com/Ox6O5w4nOl</a></p>&mdash; Jordan Schachtel @ dossier.today (@JordanSchachtel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1593289220755525632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>He had <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/sam-bankman-fried-the-crypto-whale-who-wants-to-give-billions-away/\">gained a reputation as a philanthropist</a>, pursuing a philosophy popular among academics known as “effective altruism.” Part of his implementation of that philosophy <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-could-spend-up-to-1b-in-2024-to-thwart-trump-comeback\">was political activism</a> in the form of financial support for candidates.</p><p>As the crypto winter set in, Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-and-alameda-step-in-to-prevent-crypto-collapse-contagion\">spoke of FTX and Alameda Research’s</a> “responsibility to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion.” The companies made a bid for Voyager Digital <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/voyager-rejects-alameda-buyout-offer-as-it-harms-customers\">that was rebuffed</a>.</p><p>FTX <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-and-visa-partner-to-permit-crypto-payments-in-40-countries\">made a deal with Visa</a> to introduce its own debit card in 40 countries.</p><p>Bankman-Fried, Ellison and other alumni of Jane Street Capital founded Alameda Research in 2017.
