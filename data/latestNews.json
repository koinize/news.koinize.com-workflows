For example, while ICOs may allow millions of retail investors to purchase project tokens, giving them a chance to invest early in new potential innovations, they would also attract regulatory hurdles. “When you sell something to retail, some regulators call that a ‘security’ and require you to do a lot of shit that you don’t want to do.”</p><p>On the other hand, while <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-yield-farming-explained\">yield farming</a> allows users to get tokens for using protocols, this will have repercussions if “pursued too aggressively.” Hayes explained that this could inflate the finite token supply very quickly. As a result, the token’s price could fall, leaving users with no more incentives to use the protocol. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-points-program-ico-yield-farming-adoption\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
