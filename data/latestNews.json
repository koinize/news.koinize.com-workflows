He believes that work beyond a full audit's scope will lack transparency for investors. </p><p>\"Non-audit arrangements are neither as rigorous nor as comprehensive as a financial statement audit, and may not provide any reasonable assurance to investors\" Munter stated</p><p>According to Munter, if an accounting firm discovers that a client is making misleading statements about its non-audit work to the public, it should take a firm stance and treat it seriously. He noted:</p><blockquote>“As best practise, the accounting firm should consider making a noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements, or, if that is not sufficient, informing the Commission.\"</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-appeal-could-amplify-xrp-win-ripple-labs-legal-chief\"><strong><em>SEC appeal could amplify Ripple win, says Ripple Labs legal chief</em></strong></a></p><p>Mike Shaub, an auditing and accounting ethics professor at Texas A &amp; M university, commented on the statement in a July 29 tweet, stating that auditors are bound by confidentiality, which makes it difficult to make public statements like Munter suggested.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The recent trend has been to take credit as being cutting edge (e.g., specializing in SPACs or crypto or whatever) to raise the profile, then to be low profile when things go south. That may have triggered SEC interest as well.
