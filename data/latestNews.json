    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today-3-key-reasons/",
    "description": "Today&#8217;s Bitcoin price movement is a confluence of factors including massive liquidations, macroeconomic pressures, and the impact of negative Coinbase Premium alongside Bitcoin ETF dynamics. These elements combined have led to a noticeable dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. #1 Long Liquidations Today&#8217;s Bitcoin market saw a significant price drop, initiated by a sweeping liquidation event on the futures market. Over the last 24 hours, crypto trader liquidations exceeded $682.54 million across more than 191,000 traders, according to Coinglass data. This surge in liquidations resulted in Bitcoin&#8217;s price plummeting by 8% in mere hours, falling from $72,000 to $66,500. Although there was a minor recovery, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price rebounding to the $68,000 level, it currently stands nearly 10% below its March 14 all-time high of $73,737. Related Reading: Crypto Market‚Äôs ‚ÄòMonster Cycle‚Äô: $7.5 Trillion Market Value By 2025, Bitcoin Targets $150,000 A notable 80% of these liquidations were long positions, contributing to $544.99 million of the total. Short position liquidations made up the remaining $136.94 million, with Bitcoin longs alone accounting for $242.37 million in liquidations. #2 Macro Conditions Weighing On Bitcoin Price The macroeconomic landscape has placed additional pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s value. Ted, a macro analyst known as @tedtalksmacro, highlighted on X the influence of macro conditions on the cryptocurrency market. He stated, &#8220;If BTC is digital gold, expect it to trade in lockstep with gold, however, with higher beta.&#8221; With the Federal Reserve&#8217;s meeting looming next week, macroeconomic factors are expected to take center stage temporarily. Yesterday‚Äôs US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, showing a 0.6% increase in February and surpassing forecasts of 0.3 month-over-month, has caused a ripple effect with CPI recently also hotter than expected, leading to a rise in US bond yields. The benchmark 10-year rate saw an increase of 10 basis points to 4.29%, while two-year rates rose to 4.69% from 4.63%. These developments have led traders to adjust their expectations for the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate policies in 2024. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: MicroStrategy Is Planning Another $500 Million Bitcoin Purchase Mohamed A. El-Erian, from Queens&#8217; College, Cambridge University, Allianz, and Gramercy, remarked on the situation: &#8220;US government bond yields jumped today in reaction to yet another (slightly) hotter-than-expected inflation print (this time PPI).&#8221; This suggests a growing awareness of the challenges that persistent inflation poses to achieving the Fed&#8217;s 2% inflation target. #3 Negative Coinbase Premium / Quiet Bitcoin ETF Day The decline of Bitcoin below the $70,000 threshold is also attributed to the &#8220;Coinbase Premium&#8221; &#8211; the exchange which custodies the majority of all spot Bitcoin ETFs &#8211; dipping into negative territory for the first time since February 26, indicating a bearish sentiment from US markets. This phenomenon is likely a consequence of significant sales of Grayscale GBTC, while the spot ETF experienced relatively calm activity. Following a record $1 billion net inflow day for the spot ETF on March 12, inflows dropped to just $132.7 million recently, with Blackrock contributing the lion&#8217;s share at $345.4 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity and ARK saw minimal inflows of $13.7 million and $3.5 million respectively, after a previously strong week. GBTC outflows were reported at $257.1 million, aligning with average levels. Crypto analyst WhalePanda commented on the situation, noting that despite the reduced inflow, &#8220;$132.7 million is still 2 full days of mining rewards.&#8221; He suggests a potential rebound in the market, stating, &#8220;We&#8217;re just ranging now and overleveraged people getting margin called. I guess the next move up is for next week.&#8221; At press time, BTC traded at $67,916. Featured image created with DALL¬∑E, chart from TradingView.com"
