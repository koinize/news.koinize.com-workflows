In conjunction with funding, MEXC and the TON Foundation have entered into a strategic partnership aiming to promote global Web3 accessibility by lowering the barriers of entry.</p><p>As part of the deal, MEXC crypto exchange will provide marketing services and promotion for the TON-based projects listed on their platform. The firm is also set to launch a TON collateral lending service and eliminate trading fees for the TON token. \"The previous cost was the same for most cryptocurrencies on their exchange,\" TON Foundation’s director of growth Justin Hyun told Cointelegraph.</p><p>Additionally, MEXC Ventures will continue funding TON-based mini apps in addition to ongoing support of TON-based projects like the autonomous protocol Megaton Finance, the GameFi platform TONPlay, Fanzee and Sonet. MEXC and the TON foundation are also discussing potential funding for Wallet on Telegram, Hyun said in a statement to Cointelegraph.</p><p>With the support of MEXC Ventures, TON Foundation aims to increase the adoption of the Web3 ecosystem within the Telegram messenger, Hyun said. He stated:</p><blockquote>\"The technology should be convenient and easy to use for anyone, no matter their knowledge of the world of blockchain. With TON on Telegram, crypto becomes as easy as texting.\"</blockquote><p>Telegram founder Pavel Durov has repeatedly pointed out the role of the TON blockchain in the potential Web3 journey of Telegram.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-wins-xrp-price-to-1/",
    "description": "Certain events have been touted as being able to impact the XRP price significantly. Some of these events already seem to be happening, raising the hopes of the XRP community that the token could indeed hit $1 before the year runs out.  Ripple Expands To Singapore In a statement released on October 3, Ripple announced that its subsidiary had secured a Major Payments Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This announcement comes four months after the company received its in-principle approval from the regulator.  Related Reading: XRP Price Disappoints: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why He Will No Longer Accumulate Following this announcement, Ripple is fully licensed to provide “regulated digital payment token services in Singapore.” Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse also confirmed this development on his X (formerly Twitter) platform.  With Singapore already housing Ripple’s Asia Pacific headquarters, this move undoubtedly provides the company with momentum to continue expanding to countries in the region (which the company considers one of its fastest growing regions) for the adoption of its “crypto-enabled payments solutions.” Ripple is already enjoying significant success in Asia, with banks in countries like Japan, China, South Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam adopting the company’s cross-border payment service. Specifically, Japan is believed to have contributed significantly to the trading volume in the XRP ecosystem, with the token enjoying massive adoption among locals.  Ripple Secures Another Victory Against The SEC Meanwhile, the crypto firm has more reason to celebrate following another significant victory in its ongoing legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an order given on October 3, Judge Analisa Torres denied the SEC’s motion for certifications of its interlocutory appeal. As to the reason for the denial, she noted that the SEC “failed to meet its burden to show that such an appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” Instead, she reasoned that granting the application could further prolong the action as the interlocutory appeal could open the door to other appeals from a dissatisfied party.  Related Reading: Crypto CEO Very Bullish On XRP Price, Sets Make Or Break Point Instead, she stated that the litigation will likely be “expeditiously advanced” if they advance to trial and then appeals come after. That way, the appellate court can review the case based on a complete record rather than considering disjointed legal and factual issues. In line with this, she set April 23, 2024, as when the trial is set to commence.  XRP Price Looks Good As Ripple Enters Top 100 Fintech Of 2023 Ripple’s President Monica Lang recently reiterated the company’s intention to continue to expand globally in its bid to disrupt the global financial architecture. The company’s efforts have not gone unnoticed as it recently announced that CB Insights ‘Fintech 100’ for 2023. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals The Impact Of SEC’s Lawsuit Against Ripple This recognition is an annual list compiled by private equity company CB Insights and comprises the “100 most promising private fintech companies in the world.” The XRP price has reacted positively to these developments as it is currently trading at $0.5317, up about 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.
