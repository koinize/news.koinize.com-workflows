    "description": "SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has been one of the biggest winners in the crypto market lately, delivering another positive price performance over the past week. This impressive price action reflects the increased interest in the altcoin and the recent shift in the climate of the general crypto market.  Interestingly, asset management firm VanEck is amongst the latest entities showing interest in the Solana token and the altcoin’s prospects. VanEck Predicts Potential 10,000% Rally For Solana In a report published on Friday, October 27, prominent asset management company VanEck created different valuation scenarios for the SOL token. This price projection revolved around the current capability and potential of the Solana blockchain. In a base case, VanEck believes that Solana can hold a 30% share in the smart contract market, a significant increase from the network’s current market share. Using this valuation framework, the asset manager projects SOL price to reach $335 by 2030. Related Reading: Aptos TVL Soars To A Record $74 Million, Reflecting Growing Investor Confidence Comparatively, Ethereum can achieve a 70% market share of value transmitted across open-source blockchains, according to the report. This projection makes $11,800 a possible destination for ETH’s price by 2030. Nevertheless, VanEck presented a bull case for SOL in its analysis, putting forward a $3,211 price target for the altcoin in the best possible scenario. The asset management firm said: Were Solana to avoid Ethereum&#8217;s event horizon and achieve Ethereum-like dominance, our bull case reveals $51.8B in revenues and a $3,211 price target in 2030. It would take the Solana token a massive 10,000% price rally to reach $3,211 from the current price point. Now, it is worth mentioning that there was also a pessimistic scenario for SOL in the VanEck report, with the token projected to trade below $10 in a bearish case. VanEck, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has been an active participant in the cryptocurrency space over the past few years. The financial behemoth is one of the few companies looking to launch a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the United States. SOL Price Overview As earlier inferred, Solana has been on an upward trajectory over the past few weeks. Since initial concerns of a significant sell-off by FTX have subsided and the general market sentiment has improved, the altcoin&#8217;s price performance has been positive. Related Reading: FTX Ramps Up Restitution Efforts, Subpoenas AI Firm CAIS Over $6.5M Investment As of this writing, the SOL token is valued at $32.19, reflecting a 2% in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has maintained most of its recent profits on the weekly timeframe, with a 14% price jump in the past seven days. Solana price continues ascent on the daily timeframe &#124; Source: SOLUSDT chart on TradingView Featured image from Dreamstime/Aivaras Sakurovas, chart from TradingView"
