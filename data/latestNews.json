    "description": "Dogecoin&#8217;s current metrics point to a confused path as the broader crypto market rallies after Bitcoin crossed the $50,000 level. Dogecoin has been posting some gains along with the rest of the crypto market, but behind the scenes, the meme coin’s transaction volume and whale transaction count have been discouraging.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Stuck In Limbo: Will Valentine’s Day Bring Love (And Price Gains)? According to on-chain data first shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin has experienced a low transaction volume in the past few days, fueled by a drop in trading activity from large traders.  Dogecoin&#8217;s Transaction Volume And Whale Activity Drops According to the Santiment data shared by Ali Martinez, DOGE has been posting gains since February 6. Still, the whale transaction count and the total transaction volume have failed to rise. Notably, this gain has dwindled compared to the other major cryptocurrencies. As a result, Chainlink (LINK), which has been on a bullish run, was able to displace DOGE out of the top 10 in terms of market cap rankings. This decline in whale activity indicates the current sentiment among large traders. Similarly, data from IntoTheBlock has reiterated a decline from this cohort of traders, as the number of daily transactions greater than $100,000 has failed to rise above 200 in the past few days. For comparison, daily transactions above $100,000 steadied above 1,000 throughout January. When activity drops, but prices rise, it’s usually a sign that a rally isn’t sustainable. This decline in activity suggests that fewer people are using Dogecoin for payments and transfers. Instead, Dogecoin seems to be catching up in the hype of the crypto market rally.  What Does This Mean for The Dogecoin Price Outlook? Whales are known for their ability to move markets so that less activity could signal lower enthusiasm. As a result, Dogecoin’s decreasing transaction volume and whale activity could signal some trouble for the meme cryptocurrency’s value in the coming weeks, primarily as it relies heavily on hype and popularity to drive up its market price. At the time of writing, DOGE seems to be particularly facing resistance at the $0.083 price level. However, the decreased volume doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean Dogecoin is doomed, as the whale transaction count could pick back up shortly.  The Dogecoin Foundation recently announced an ambitious 2024 roadmap in a recent blog post outlining the vision for the meme coin’s future. The renewed dedication to improving Dogecoin’s underlying technology, increasing its utility and mainstream adoption gives a glimmer of optimism.  Related Reading: Chainlink Takes Over Dogecoin In Key Metric As Mysterious Whale Pushes LINK Upwards At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.08235, up by 2.39% in the past 24 hours. Failure to break out of the resistance at $0.083 could mean a reversal to the $0.0816 level. Cover image from Dall-E, chart from Tradingview"
