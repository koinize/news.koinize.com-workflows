    "description": "Bankrupt cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network has followed behind FTX, revealing plans to disburse billions of dollars in crypto to creditors and establish a new Bitcoin mining company for its creditors.  Celsius To Distribute $3 Billion In Crypto To Creditors In a press release published on Wednesday, Celsius Network announced its successful emergence from bankruptcy. The company is now set to implement its “plan of reorganization,” which involves distributing over $3 billion in crypto assets and fiat currency to its creditors.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Surge Above $0.00001 The crypto lending company claimed that the reorganization plan has gained approval by approximately 98% of the company’s account holders. Additionally, Celsius disclosed that the plan has been confirmed and accepted by the Bankruptcy Court of the New York Southern District and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Earlier in 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy in New York after becoming one of the many victims of the crypto market’s dramatic plunge which saw major token prices falling to new lows. Subsequently, the crypto lending platform froze all withdrawals, temporarily shutting off account holder’s access to their savings and funds.  Now, 18 months after halting withdrawals, Celsius is finally settled and has initiated steps to reimburse creditors. The crypto lending platform disclosed plans to boost its cryptocurrency distribution to creditors by almost $250 million. This would involve converting altcoins to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  “Our exit from bankruptcy is the culmination of an extraordinary team effort and extensive collaboration between Celsius, Hut 8, strategic partners, and our creditors,&#8221; Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Celsius, David Barse and Alan Carr stated.  The conclusion of the long-awaited repayment and the company’s reorganization plans marks a milestone for Celsius as it reflects the organization’s commitment to its creditors. It also underscores its compliance with regulatory obligations and resolvement of intricate legal issues within its business.  CEL token price falls despite repayment plans &#124; Source: CELUSDT on Tradingview.com Celsius Forges Ahead With Creation Of New Bitcoin Mining Company As Celsius works to disburse $3 billion to its creditors, the crypto lending platform has also announced plans to create a new Bitcoin mining company, Ionic Digital, Inc. The Bitcoin mining company will be owned by Celsius creditors, and mining operations will be managed by Hut 8 Corp, a North American digital asset mining company.  Related Reading: Analyst Compared Solana To Ethereum ICO Boom, What Does This Mean For SOL Price? The objective of the Bitcoin mining company is to consistently provide recoveries to creditors and ensure that the best outcomes are guaranteed for them. After gaining the necessary requisite approvals, Ionic Digital stocks are expected to be publicly traded. Certain shares of the Bitcoin mining company have already been allocated to Celsius creditors.   Additionally, the Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Hut 8, Matt Prusak, will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Ionic Digital. The publication revealed that he will be working with Celsius’s board of directors appointed by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC).
