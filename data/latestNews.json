The report showed an addition of 187,000 jobs, fewer than the 200,000 expected by economists. But the average hourly wages remained strong, showing an increase of 0.4% for the month against expectations of a 0.3% rise.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/cf45ba92-d2d6-4d1f-ae91-5cda7719a58b.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

A recent report from Matrixport projected a target of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-btc-price-98k-halving\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-btc-price-98k-halving/amp\">$45,000 by the end of this year</a> and $125,000 by the end of 2024.</p><p>Bitcoin’s long-term story remains intact but traders should keep a close eye on any possible shocks from the regulators as that could <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-risks-binance-fears-bitcoin-bulls\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-risks-binance-fears-bitcoin-bulls/amp\">cause a knee-jerk reaction</a> to the downside. What are the important support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin’s price is getting squeezed between the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,523) and the horizontal support at $28,861.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/c76eb5f9-c391-4262-a170-0e154fb31c46.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative zone indicate that bears have a slight edge. If the price plummets and sustains below $28,861, the BTC/USDT pair may collapse to $27,500 and then to $26,000.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price bounces off $28,861, it will indicate that the bulls are protecting this level with all their might. A break and close above $30,000 will signal a comeback by the bulls. The pair may then climb to the overhead resistance zone between $31,804 and $32,400.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) slumped below the 50-day SMA ($1,871) on Aug. 2, which suggests that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/42265286-ea0b-4ab3-9fe6-b84862efdbc1.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to arrest the decline near the strong support at $1,816 but the failure to achieve a solid rebound suggests a lack of aggressive buying near the level. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1,867) and the RSI just below the midpoint indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.</p><p>If the price skids below $1,816, the ETH/USDT pair may plunge to $1,698. This negative view will invalidate in the near term if bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. In that case, the pair may swing between $1,816 and $2,000 for some time.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on Aug. 2 indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/48d1a641-d97e-4782-8cbf-46ca16640409.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if the price catapults above the triangle. The BNB/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to $265 where the bears may again pose a strong challenge.</p><p>Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle, it will signal that bears are on the roll. The pair could then retest the crucial support at $220. If this level gives way, the pair may start the next leg of the downtrend.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) tumbled below the 20-day EMA ($0.68) on Aug. 2 and followed that up with another slide on Aug. 3. That sent the price tumbling below the strong support at $0.67.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/3026e4ff-80b2-4310-9273-ec6d782daacf.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>Trading View</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls will try to protect the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.64 because if this level breaks down, the XRP/USDT pair may collapse to the breakout level of $0.56. The 50-day SMA ($0.59) could act as a temporary support but it is likely to be broken.</p><p>Contrarily, if the bulls push the price back above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid demand at lower levels. That will increase the likelihood of the pair remaining inside the $0.67 to $0.85 range for a while longer.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) turned down and broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.07) on Aug. 2, indicating that higher levels are attracting sellers.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/e1f53d9e-aa7b-40d5-ba05-fcf196391b4f.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on Aug. 4. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could rise to the downtrend line. This level is likely to attract selling by the bears.</p><p>If the price reverses direction from the downtrend line, it will signal that the trend is turning negative and the relief rallies are being sold. The bears will then again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and challenge the breakout level at $0.07.</p><p>On the other hand, a break and close above the downtrend line will suggest the start of a strong up-move toward $0.10.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.30) on Aug. 2 and the 50-day SMA ($0.30) on Aug. 3. This suggests that the bears are trying to seize control.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/cbc83cb6-133c-4b49-894b-f14ef97978f1.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price sustains below the uptrend line, the selling may pick up and the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to $0.26 and then to the vital support at $0.24. The buyers are expected to guard this level with vigor.</p><p>If the bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly drive the price above the moving averages and the overhead resistance at $0.32. The pair could then travel to $0.34 and eventually to $0.38.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) rebounded off the strong support at $22.30 on Aug. 4, indicating that the bulls continue to protect this level with vigor.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/1d8a36bf-c880-4934-974b-9d2e64183bc2.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price rises above the 20-day EMA ($23.84), it will suggest that the SOL/USDT pair could march toward $25.68 and subsequently to $27.12. This remains the key resistance to watch for on the upside because a break above it will signal a potential new uptrend.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sell the recovery to the 20-day EMA and sink the pair below the support zone between $22.30 and the 50-day SMA ($21.38). If they manage to do that, the pair may tumble to $18.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-is-dragging-europe-economy-down-great-for-crypto\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/germany-is-dragging-europe-economy-down-great-for-crypto/amp\"><strong><em>Germany is dragging Europe’s economy down — and that’s great for crypto</em></strong></a></p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) has been sliding since hitting the local high of $0.89 on July 13, which shows a lack of buying at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/f5981e17-80e8-4208-882a-684c144d3d8b.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart.

If the price rebounds off the support and climbs above the moving averages, it will clear the path for a possible rise to $0.80.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price skids below $0.65, it will indicate that bears remain in command. The pair could next slump to the support at $0.60. This level may again attract strong buying by the bulls.</p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>Litecoin’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>) range resolved to the downside on Aug. 2 and that was followed by another fall on Aug. 3, which completed a 100% retracement of the rally that started from $82.91 on July 29.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/35f02643-b60c-4fe8-98f9-cd949a2d1b26.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USDT daily chart.

If the price breaks below $81.36, the selling could intensify and the LTC/USDT pair may plummet to $76.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the current level, the pair may reach the overhead resistance at $87.37. A break above this level will suggest that the pair may remain range-bound between $81.36 and $96.46 for some time.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) has been range-bound between $5 and $5.65 for the past several days. The price has reached the support of the range, which may witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/63838e19-2dbe-4d0c-9257-cee94c4bba7e.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart.

If the price slides and sustains below $5, it may start a deeper pullback to $4.74 and then to $4.60.</p><p>Instead, if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the range remains intact. The DOT/USDT pair could then rise to $5.33 and thereafter to the overhead resistance at $5.64.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
