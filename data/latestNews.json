Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) fell sharply, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ether-price-slump-crypto-bloodbath-1-b-liquidations\">resulting in $1 billion in liquidations</a> for derivatives traders, the biggest amount since the FTX collapse in 2022.</p><p>It is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-did-bitcoin-price-suddenly-drop-analysts-explain\">difficult to pinpoint any specific reason</a> for the sell-off, but analysts believe that the confusion arising from the alleged write-down of SpaceX’s $373 million i Bitcoin holdings may have been one of the potential triggers. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/14776017-136c-4fcd-a627-146952f23791.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: </em><em>Coin360</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the reason, the decline has started. The next major question troubling investors is how low could Bitcoin fall. Several analysts have turned bearish and expect <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go\">Bitcoin to continue its downtrend</a> in the near term.</p><p>Will Bitcoin continue to drop, dragging the rest of the cryptocurrency market with it? What are the important support levels to keep an eye on? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin’s narrow range resolved to the downside on Aug. 17, triggering a long liquidation, which pulled the price to $25,166.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/80b986ff-b476-495c-a57e-4ecfe5e9f20e.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are expected to defend the $24,800 level with vigor. The oversold level on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the BTC/USDT pair may witness a pullback or a consolidation in the near term.</p><p>If the price rebounds off $24,800 with strength, it could reach the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $28,786. This is an important level to keep an eye on. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That could increase the likelihood of a break below $24,800. If that happens, the pair may nosedive to $20,000.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. That will point to a possible consolidation in the near term.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) turned down and broke below the immediate support at $1,816 on Aug. 16, indicating that the bears are in control.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/3d7194bd-7df6-4bce-8d45-b61c64c3a7c2.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The selling momentum picked up on Aug. 17, and the ETH/USDT pair plummeted below the critical support at $1,626. Buyers bought the dip but are struggling to build upon the rebound. This indicates a lack of demand at higher levels.</p><p>The sharp fall has sent the RSI into the oversold territory, indicating that the selling may have been overdone in the near term. The pair may witness a consolidation or a short-term recovery in the next few days. That could keep the pair stuck inside the large range between $1,626 and $2,000.</p><p>This view will be invalidated if the price turns down and plunges below the support at $1,550. That could open the doors for a possible decline to $1,368.39.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) broke and closed below the symmetrical triangle pattern on Aug. 16, indicating that the bears overpowered the bulls.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/979f7117-a5cf-43a8-a713-39bd44fca350.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The selling picked up on Aug. 17, and the BNB/USDT pair plunged below the decisive support at $220. If the bulls fail to push the price back above $220, the bears will attempt to sink the pair to the pattern target of $196 and then to $183.</p><p>Instead, if buyers drive the price back above $220, a recovery to the 20-day EMA ($236) is possible. A break above this level will suggest that the breakdown below $220 may have been a bear trap. That could keep the pair stuck inside the $220 to $265 range for a while longer.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) tumbled below the breakout level of $0.56 on Aug. 17, indicating continued selling pressure from the bears.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/2ce4760b-e7b5-4506-a1e3-3f331f5deea2.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fall in the XRP/USDT pair completed a 100% retracement of the entire rally that happened on July 13. However, a minor positive is that the bulls purchased the dip near the strong support zone of $0.45 to $0.41.</p><p>The recovery is likely to hit a roadblock at $0.56 and again at the 20-day EMA ($0.61). If the price turns down from this overhead zone, it will signal that bears are selling on rallies. That may put the $0.41 support at risk of breaking down.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) dropped below the descending channel pattern on Aug. 17, indicating that the selling has accelerated.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/eb9ba43d-1d50-4763-b2b3-4c404f8ed2f0.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls successfully protected the crucial support at $0.24, indicating strong buying at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price back into the channel. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair will attempt to rally to the resistance line of the channel.</p><p>The rise may not be easy because the bulls are likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.28). If the price turns down from this level, the pair may again retest the strong support at $0.24. A break below this level will signal the resumption of the downtrend.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) broke below the moving averages on Aug. 16 and the horizontal support at $22.30 on Aug. 17. This suggests that the price may oscillate inside the large range between $14 and $27.12 for some time.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/f746c55d-baf9-41d8-a097-c6726251d5cc.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to start a recovery, which is likely to face resistance at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($23.53), the possibility of a fall to $18 and eventually to $14 increases.</p><p>On the contrary, if buyers drive the price above the moving averages, it will suggest that the break below $22.30 may have been a bear trap. That could propel the SOL/USDT pair toward the $26 to $27.12 overhead zone.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) slipped below the support line of the ascending channel pattern on Aug. 15. That may have hit stops on the long positions and attracted selling by the bears.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/fe9a32e5-8fba-4bb3-935a-629e651e1ce3.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The DOGE/USDT pair closed below the breakout level of $0.07 on Aug. 16, signaling that the bears are in the driver’s seat. The selling continued on Aug. 17, and the bears yanked the price below the essential support at $0.06. A minor saving grace for the bulls was the strong buying at lower levels. </p><p>The price rose back above $0.06, and the bulls will attempt to push the price toward the overhead resistance of $0.07. </p><p>Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink and sustain the price below $0.06. If they do that, the pair may plummet toward $0.05. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-bitcoin-write-down-bitcoiners-elon-musk\"><strong><em>SpaceX Bitcoin write-down sparks confusion, Bitcoiners quiz Elon Musk</em></strong></a></p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>The tight range trading in Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) expanded to the downside on Aug. 15. That started a decline, which nearly reached the critical support at $4.22 on Aug. 17.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/8fe3a41d-a80d-451a-b261-6b6ac3f3444d.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls will try to fiercely defend the $4.22 support, but the recovery is likely to face strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($4.91). If the price turns down from this level, the bears are expected to attack the $4.22 support once again. If this level cracks, the DOT/USDT pair may start the next leg of the downtrend.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA but rebounds off $4.22, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate for a few days. The bulls will gain momentum after the price rises above the moving averages.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) break below the $0.65 support attracted aggressive selling, which tugged the price below the next strong support at $0.60 on Aug. 17. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/6d030125-5b66-4bf3-a742-b19407e9c186.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls bought the dip near $0.50, indicating strong demand at lower levels. However, buyers may face selling at $0.60 and again at the 20-day EMA ($0.66). If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the MATIC/USDT pair may retest the vital support at $0.50. </p><p>If this support gives way, the pair could slip to $0.45 and then to $0.42. On the upside, the bulls will have to kick the price above the moving averages to indicate that the downtrend could be ending.</p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>) went into a tailspin after breaking below the support at $81 on Aug. 15. The price crumbled to $56 on Aug. 17.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/ed310f01-916b-4ca3-beaa-c91f5d049a29.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><em>TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The sharp descent of the past few days has sent the RSI into oversold territory. This suggests that a minor recovery or consolidation is likely in the near term. The relief rally could face selling in the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $70 and the 61.8% retracement level of $74.</p><p>If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the LTC/USDT pair could form a range for a few days. A break and close below the pivotal level of $56 could extend the decline to $50.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

After receiving stock as a bar mitzvah gift, he became a successful trader while still in high school. Those profits largely disappeared as the dot-com bubble burst just as he was beginning his military service. That would turn out to be the first of a number of dramatic highs and lows Assia has seen in his career.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGrhyi1deEE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In this episode of Cointelegraph’s <em>Crypto Stories</em>, Assia recounts the early days of eToro and the launch of crypto trading on the platform — which a young programmer named Vitalik Buterin helped with. </p><p>In 2007, trading platforms were “super complex. You always looked at multiple screens and lots of numbers,” Assia said. Manual processes were still part of opening a brokerage account, and it took several days. But eToro was founded on a different model, one where the user downloaded the software, funded the account with a credit card and started trading. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-quotes-now-live-on-twitter-following-etoro-partnership\">BTC price quotes now live on Twitter following eToro partnership</a></em></strong></p><p>The global economic crisis hit the following year, but the new company prospered in spite of it. “We learned […] that crisis actually generates a lot of internet interest in what is happening in finance,” Assia said.</p><p>Assia discovered Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) in 2010, saying:</p><blockquote>“I saw the opportunity to turn the entire financial industry into a blockchain industry, and we started with the concept of ‘let’s tokenize assets on top of the Bitcoin protocol.’”</blockquote><p>That’s where Buterin came in.</p><p>EToro introduced Bitcoin trading a month before the Mt. Gox collapse sent the price plummeting from $1,200 to $150. A mere 2% of customers traded crypto then, but that figure had climbed to 90% by 2017. </p><p>The portfolios of eToro’s 32 million registered users are visible on the platform, allowing customers to see what other traders hold and what their investment strategies are.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ep-4-tokenization-listings-and-trading-trends-with-yoni-assia-etoro/\">Ep. 4 – Tokenization, Listings, and Trading Trends with Yoni Assia (eToro)</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "The Bitcoin price range has been obliterated as the crypto market was corrected into a final support line. Volatility in the sector was compressed for weeks, and many were expecting some action in the short term, but the drop caught market participants by surprise as BTC kept on pushing lower. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,400, with an 8% loss in the last 24 hours. BTC recorded a 10% correction in the previous seven days, while some altcoins experienced a 17% and even 20% loss on BTC’s crash. Bitcoin Ready To Re-Test Support, Your Longs Could Be In Danger Bitcoin’s sudden crash into critical support around $25,000 saw over $1 billion in long liquidations. The number of traders waiting for a breakout at $30,000 provided the downside with a lot of liquidity, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Therefore, the selling pressure was exacerbated as BTC kept on dropping. The recent crash was worse than the one experienced when crypto exchange FTX collapsed, and the crypto sector nuked all long positions by collapsing below $30,000. Similar to that occasion, the Bitcoin price took some time to recover. According to Material Indicators and its analyst Keith Alan, the same could happen in the current market conditions. Via his official X account, Alan stated that the BTC price bottom it’s not in. The chart below shows that the analyst pointed out some key levels to watch while the number one cryptocurrency by market caps hovers at $26,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation As the chart shows, the levels pointed out by Alan include the 2017 bull market top at $20,000, the 2019 bull market top at around $14,000, and even the COVID-19 lows at $3,850. The analyst stated the following regarding BTC’s potential for further losses: (…) I can build an argument for every downrange level shown. I personally think there is a high probability of retesting sub $20k levels.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that there won&#8217;t be opportunities to scalp longs along the way because whales still want to distribute as high as they can.

    "description": "Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency often referred to as &#8216;digital gold&#8217;, has been on a roller-coaster ride lately. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has transformed from an obscure digital token into an economic powerhouse, drawing attention from retail investors to global financial institutions. However, as recently observed over the past 24 hours, the asset&#8217;s resistance is being tested as a report from Santiment reveals chances of it plunging below the critical $26,000 mark. Whale Activity Driving Bitcoin Price Movement Whale activity, or large-scale investors, has historically played a pivotal role in determining the direction of any crypto asset, and currently, Bitcoin is not an exception. Blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment, recently shed light on this phenomenon via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak According to the firm, the rapid price decline of Bitcoin might have been influenced by heightened whale transaction activity. And despite the substantial loss BTC has suffered in value over the past day, Santiment noted &#8220;the dust has far from settled.&#8221; This statement in an actual sense means Bitcoin&#8217;s price decline might just be starting, as according to Santiment, &#8220;whales are very active on this dump&#8221; and &#8220;the amount of large wallets is not falling.&#8221; The Blockchain intelligence firm further revealed that the surge in large transactions had commenced even before the significant market drop, hinting at the possibility of a sustained price drop. 🐳 The dust has far from settled after #crypto markets had one of its sharpest price drops of 2023. We are seeing a large amount of $1M+ $BTC transactions, indicating whales are very active on this dump. But the amount of large wallets is not falling. 👍 https://t.co/WtXYUPdFOf pic.twitter.com/gdrbUD1wFO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 18, 2023 BTC Plunge Below $26,000 Imminent? Given the fundamentals pointed out by Santiment, Bitcoin could see a further plummet potentially dropping it below the $26,000 mark. Moreover, from a technical perspective, such a price move may not actually be far from happening. Looking at Bitcoin&#8217;s chart on the 1-day timeframe, the asset has a two-way movement of taking out liquidity which is the upside and downside. However, the likelihood of tapping into the downside liquidity appears more convincing. Given the current market trajectory, which leans bearish, each significant price movement typically correlates with liquidation efforts. As the market currently trends downwards, the most immediate liquidity target seems to be the wick beneath the $26,000 zone. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout To clarify, a wick refers to the thin line/vertical line above or below the main body of a candlestick. The wick represents the highest and lowest prices of an asset during a specific time frame, while the main body of the candlestick indicates the opening and closing prices As for its current price, Bitcoin is changing hands at $26,468 at the time of writing, down by nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. The asset has made significant movement in the past day recording a 24-hour high of $28,507 and a 24-low of $25,649. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"
