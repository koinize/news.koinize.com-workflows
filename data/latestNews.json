    "description": "Cardano (ADA) has received plenty of criticism over the years, whether it’s ADA’s price performance, its founder’s personality, or its community’s “beef” with Solana. This time, the project’s marketing team made the headlines after a viral video of female Cardano users became viral on social media. The ‘Cardano Girls’ video has sparked a conversation about the project’s efforts to reach a broader audience. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes Explosive 2000% Bull Run, Targeting $12 And Quadrupling ATH A Breath Of Fresh Air In The Community The ‘Cardano Girls’ video was uploaded by Lily Brodi, a content creator and Cardano user, and went viral in hours. The video recreated a popular social media trend of people playfully listing stereotypical practices of a group of people with the phrase “We are (group). Of course, we…” The trend, recreated by millions, including famous personalities like Kim Kardashian, has reached the crypto community. Last week, a “Crypto Girls” version of the trend was uploaded on X, which prompted Brodi to make her own. Brodi’s version approached the point of view of female Cardano investors, with the opening line setting the lighthearted and playful tone: “We’re Cardano girls. Of course, we are real.” The list in the video includes how female ADA users “treat themselves with money saved on gas,” “have Charles as their phone wallpaper,” and “buy $ADA while the men create all the drama.” At the time of writing, the viral video had over 1.5 million views on X. Its massive reach resulted in the acknowledgment of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, referred to as “Cattle Daddy” in the video. Lol, I&#39;m blushing. Thanks for all the support and love &#8212; Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) March 25, 2024 &#8216;Cardano Girls&#8217; And Marketing Team Face Criticism The video didn’t go unnoticed by critics, who considered the video to be “cringy,” while others expressed opinions seemingly based on misogyny. Crypto influencer Peter McCormack replied to the X post stating that the video will be used “as torture at Guantanamo Bay.” However, the video appears to be well-received by the Cardano and crypto community. Brodi addressed the male detractors in an X post: after the last 24 hours, i’ve realised that a lot of men haven’t felt the warm embrace of a woman &#8212; LILY (@lilybrodi) March 26, 2024 Nonetheless, the video opened a broader conversation despite the critics. On one hand, it highlighted how the male-dominated crypto industry can be unreceptive and aggressive to women in the space. On the other hand, it pointed out a crucial issue for Cardano: its “unattractiveness.” The Need For A New Approach Brodi discussed the video’s immense impact, as it seemingly brought general interest in the project, with people reaching out to her curious about the Cardano wallet. Despite its technology and the knowledgeable people inside the community, the project doesn’t seem to attract the general user. Brodi, who creates light and informative Cardano-related content, considers that the general content offered can be “too heavy” and “overwhelming” to those who know about the industry and even more to those who don’t but want to come in. real talk #CardanoGirls &#38; cardano marketing pic.twitter.com/XePfmHiXGN &#8212; LILY (@lilybrodi) March 27, 2024 Cardano’s marketing problem, as highlighted by Brodi, has often prevented potential users from entering. She suggests that a change in the market strategy is “needed within Cardano” for broader adoption. Lighthearted, fun, and enjoyable educational content that can be easily consumable can be fundamental for broader adoption. Investors can be attracted to projects that seem easily understandable and approachable. As seen with the memecoin mania, projects can become massive, even if the long-term technology and planning aren’t developed by launch. The crypto community is undoubtedly filled with people who enjoy various content and projects. But “bringing light and fun” enjoyment is crucial to supporting adoption because, at its core, “that’s what our community is.” Related Reading: Here’s Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 ADA is trading at $0.64 in the 3-day chart.
