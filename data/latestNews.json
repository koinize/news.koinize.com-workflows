Source: </em><em>Coin360</em></figcaption></figure><p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made positive comments about Bitcoin while speaking in an interview with Fox Business on July 5. Fink said that Bitcoin was an “international asset not based on any one currency,” and investors could use it as a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-international-asset-black-rock-ceo-bullish-remarks\">hedge against inflation or currency devaluation</a>.</p><p>Could positive comments from Fink act as a floor during pullbacks? What are the important overhead resistance levels in Bitcoin and altcoins that need to be crossed to signal the start of a short-term up move? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin once again rose above $31,000 on July 6, but the rally was met with strong selling pressure from the bears. That pulled the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $29,763.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/db77fbf6-007f-494d-811f-97494a9a24d3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>A positive sign in favor of the bulls is that the BTC/USDT pair has rebounded off the 20-day EMA. This suggests a positive sentiment where traders are viewing minor dips as a buying opportunity. That enhances the prospects of a rally above the $31,000 to $31,500 resistance zone. </p><p>If that happens, the pair could start an upward march to $40,000. The bears will attempt to stall the up move at $32,400, but the buyers are expected to bulldoze their way through.</p><p>Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears have the upper hand. The pair may then dump to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $27,971.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>The long wick on Ether’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) July 6 candlestick shows that the bears are aggressively guarding the psychological resistance at $2,000.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/4c8ef6a1-0722-49cb-9091-5f9c4ec04f9a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Both moving averages have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($1,837), the short-term advantage will tilt in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then descend toward $1,626.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level and maintains above the 20-day EMA ($1,872), it will suggest strong buying at the 50-day SMA. The bulls will then again try to push the price above $2,000.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) has been consolidating between $257 and $220 for the past few days. This suggests that the bears are using the relief rallies to sell while the bulls are buying the dips.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/baf38de5-f6e1-4cba-a120-7e9d4d3b9753.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The downsloping 20-day EMA ($242) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have an edge. Sellers will try to drag the price to the crucial support at $220. The bulls are expected to defend this level with vigor.</p><p>On the upside, the bulls will have to propel the price above $257 to suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The $265 level may act as a barrier, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then surge to $280.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.48) and the horizontal support at $0.45 for the past few days. This shows that the bears are selling on rallies, but supply is being lapped up at lower levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/76e85a65-9463-480c-ad84-b149e702fb67.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>This tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and may result in a breakout. If the support at $0.45 gives way, the bears will try to build upon this advantage and tug the price to the next strong support at $0.41.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will try to overcome the obstacle at the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could start its march toward $0.56.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) has been trading between $0.30 and $0.24 for the past few days. Generally, inside a range, traders buy near the support and sell close to the resistance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/c866eb51-37a4-4634-8d68-110a127254aa.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Traders did just that in the ADA/USDT pair and sold at $0.30. The bulls are attempting to arrest the decline at the uptrend line. If the price turns up from the current level or the uptrend line, the bulls will once again endeavor to clear the overhead hurdle at $0.30. </p><p>If they succeed, the pair may start an up move to $0.38. The 50-day SMA ($0.31) may act as a barrier, but it is likely to be crossed. </p><p>Contrarily, a break below the uptrend line could open the doors for a potential drop to the support at $0.25.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>The failure to propel Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) above the overhead resistance of $0.07 on July 4 may have attracted profit-booking from the short-term bulls.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/e8616382-99f3-4ebb-84dc-cc8d6503cca5.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That pulled the price below the moving averages, signaling that the DOGE/USDT pair could remain stuck inside the $0.07 to $0.06 range for a few more days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.07) and the RSI just below the midpoint also suggest a range-bound action.</p><p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance of $0.07 to seize control. That could pave the way for a rally to $0.08 and then to $0.10. On the downside, a break below $0.06 could resume the down move. The pair may then slump to $0.05.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($18.34) on July 5, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls have pushed the price above the downtrend line, indicating that the short-term corrective phase may be ending.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/caf642f1-9366-4822-8393-76acdd03bc66.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The moving averages are about to complete a bullish crossover, and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This shows that the bulls are in command. If buyers sustain the price above the downtrend line, the SOL/USDT pair may climb to $24. Such a move will indicate that the pair is range-bound between $15.28 and $27.12.</p><p>If bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to yank the price below the moving averages. That may catch the aggressive bulls off guard, resulting in a drop to the strong support zone between $16.18 and $15.28.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-bitcoin-price-prediction-over-750k-arthur-hayes\"><strong><em>AI has potential to send Bitcoin price over $750K — Arthur Hayes</em></strong></a></p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls tried to push Litecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index\">LTC</a>) above the overhead resistance of $106 on July 5 and 6, but the long wick on the candlesticks shows that the bears fiercely defended the level.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/d3d2a71a-6442-4126-ac43-1e4da7746324.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The LTC/USDT pair plunged to the 20-day EMA ($94), which is an important support level to watch out for. If the price bounces off the current level, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $106.</p><p>However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sell the rallies and sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the selling may intensify and the pair may further slide to the 50-day SMA ($89).</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) slipped and closed below the 20-day EMA ($0.67) on July 6, suggesting that the bears are active at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/853b0993-31a6-451f-affd-ff7aaea316c0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling the price below the uptrend line. If they manage to do that, the ascending triangle pattern will invalidate. That could trigger the stops of several short-term bulls. The MATIC/USDT pair may then slide to $0.60 and subsequently to $0.55. </p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will again try to resume the up move. A break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.74) could start the journey toward the pattern target of $0.88.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>The long wick on Polkadot’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) July 6 candlestick shows that the bears are selling on intraday rallies. The price plunged below the moving averages, but the bulls are trying to arrest the decline.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/1875704a-6f4f-4887-b84c-bc32e2dc78bf.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint. This indicates a balance between supply and demand. The DOT/USDT pair may oscillate between $4.74 and $5.64 for a few days.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $5.15. That will indicate solid demand at lower levels. The bulls will then again try to push the pair to $5.64. On the downside, a break below $4.74 could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

For starters, everyone wants free money. That explains why altcoins and airdrops continue to attract attention, regardless of whether the majority of investors end up being unprofitable.</p><p>You might think that those investors would quickly learn their lesson, but in reality, quite the opposite occurs. All it takes is a new marketing strategy — a new way of promising free money — just like the Argentines have a tendency to forget the mess the governments have caused over the course of 10 years.</p><p>For Pechman, the bottom line is: Forget any promise of free money or dividends that don’t come explicitly from economic activity.</p><p>The show’s next segment covers the topic most loved by economists: the inverted yield curve. This event happens when shorter-dated Treasurys have higher returns than longer-term ones, suggesting the United States Federal Reserve will hurt the economy.</p><p>According to Pechman, that’s a recession indicator, but historically, it takes six to 36 months to happen, so traders should avoid such a metric. Those calling for a recession 12 months ago saw the S&amp;P 500 index gain 15% and even gold accrue 8% returns, only making a fool of themselves. According to Pechman, it is stupid to bet on a crisis, while the central bank is adding liquidity.</p><p>That’s why Bitcoin’s hard-locked monetary policies are so important. So, when you hear someone calling for $100,000 Bitcoin by year’s end, it partially comes from the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Pechman then proceeds to explain why the money that will eventually flow to Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) comes from gold, real estate and bond markets.</p><p>Lastly, Pechman shows why the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval is so important and essential for a $200,000 bull run. </p><p>Macro Markets runs exclusively on the new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@cointelegraphmarketresearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cointelegraph Markets &amp; Research YouTube channel</a>, so make sure to like and subscribe today!</p></p>\n                \n            "

Seven standout tokens include InQubeta, pioneering fractionalized NFT investing in AI startups; DigiToads, intertwining play-to-earn gaming with NFTs; Manifold Finance, augmenting DeFi connectivity; Ocean Protocol, democratizing data access; Trust Wallet Token, driving a popular wallet ecosystem; Render, revolutionizing rendering processes; and Litecoin, an enduring alternative to Bitcoin. These diverse tokens offer profitable investment opportunities for every investor's portfolio.</p>\nInQubeta (QUBE) -&nbsp; Best Altcoin For Fractionalized NFT Investing\n<p>A game-changing project in the cryptocurrency space, InQubeta has set its sights on changing how we invest in AI startups. With the QUBE token at its core, InQubeta offers an innovative and sophisticated platform for fractionalized investment in AI enterprises. Its groundbreaking approach allows even the smallest investors to have a stake in some of the most promising AI projects in the industry.</p>\n<p>InQubeta leverages the power of Web3 to bring to life the world's first fractionalized AI NFT crowdfunding platform. The platform turns investment opportunities into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which can then be fractionalized and distributed to investors. This revolutionary approach to fundraising means that everyone can get a piece of the AI startup action, thereby democratizing investment and engaging a broader community of stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The QUBE token is an integral part of the InQubeta ecosystem. It is a deflationary token, meaning its supply reduces over time due to a burning mechanism. Thus, 2% of QUBE token sales and 1% of purchases are burned, ensuring scarcity and helping to bolster the token's value over time. The token is vested over 12 weeks.</p>\n<p>InQubeta has its own custom-built NFT marketplace, which allows AI startups to raise funds and offer reward and equity-based NFTs to their investors. By purchasing QUBE tokens, holders can directly invest in these promising projects, fostering a thriving ecosystem and generating potential returns, with experts anticipating the price of QUBE to rise more than 5x after the presale.</p>\n<p></p>\nDigiToads (TOADS) - Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming and Rewards\n<p>DigiToads operates as a full utility meme coin with a unique play-to-earn (P2E) gaming aspect, setting it apart as one of the best cryptos for beginners looking to delve into the NFT space. The P2E model incorporates a fascinating web3 game where players can collect, nurture, and battle DigiToads, adding an interactive dimension to this cryptocurrency investment. These digital amphibians can be acquired through buying, trading, or winning, making TOADS tokens an integral part of the gaming ecosystem. These tokens purchase various items, including food, potions, and training equipment for the DigiToads, creating an engaging virtual environment for players.</p>\n<p>This play-to-earn feature extends beyond mere gaming; it provides a pathway for players to earn TOADS tokens, one of the top crypto coins to buy today. The DigiToads game rewards the top 25% of players on the leaderboard with TOADS tokens, creating a competitive environment that incentivizes player performance. Furthermore, 50% of the funds obtained from in-game item sales are allocated to the prize fund for distribution among the top 25% of players. Therefore, the game design caters to a fun and competitive player experience and serves as an avenue for participants to earn cryptocurrency rewards.</p>\n<p>Considering the high-growth potential of TOADS tokens, they are arguably one of the best cryptos to invest in now. The P2E model is up-and-coming for those wondering what crypto to invest in, as the DigiToads project offers a direct earning potential through gameplay.

It is one of the most promising presales to buy now that can experience over 450% growth in the near future.</p>\n<p></p>\n&nbsp;Manifold Finance ($FOLD): Enhancing DeFi Connectivity\n<p>The crypto world undeniably provides opportunities for beginners, especially those keen to dive into DeFi projects. Manifold Finance ($FOLD) is the best crypto for beginners. Born as a middleware product, $FOLD is designed to augment connectivity between DeFi protocols and safeguard users from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks&mdash;a high value feature for anyone venturing into crypto. The functionality to shield users from MEV attacks has been the first offering in the Manifold Finance product line. MEV refers to the profit potential by changing the order of transactions within a block. In this area, miners or validators enjoy the power to choose transactions for inclusion in blocks.</p>\n<p>Selected as a promising cryptocurrency for beginners, $FOLD&mdash;through its product, OpenMEV&mdash;provides security against sandwich attacks, a common MEV attack. Sandwich attacks occur when a trader places transactions before and after a victim transaction, capturing the price difference. OpenMEV shields users from such exploitations, returning funds and fees to traders. Utilizing MEV opportunities, OpenMEV employs secure smart contract techniques to scale services like SushiSwap for end-users, an invaluable aspect for beginner cryptocurrency investors seeking the best crypto to invest in.</p>\nOcean Protocol (OCEAN) - Best Altcoin For Democratising Access to Data\n<p>OCEAN, an ERC20 token, is undoubtedly a standout in the crypto space, aiming to democratize access to data. This initiative presents the potential to challenge tech giants such as Google and Facebook, making it one of the best cryptos to invest in now. Ocean Protocol enables data owners to sell their information through the Ocean Market app, providing consumers with previously inaccessible private data. This offers AI practitioners and data scientists advantages, granting access to more data, crypto-secured provenance, and income opportunities.</p>\n<p>Fulfilling the top crypto to buy criteria, OCEAN's utilization in buying and selling data, governance, and staking makes it a hot contender. The Ocean Protocol was founded in 2017 by Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. It aims to democratize data, enhance AI capabilities, and spread the benefits of artificial intelligence. OCEAN has a capped max supply of 1.41 billion tokens. A portion was allocated for community projects and burning a fraction of network revenue&mdash;elements worth considering when deciding on the best cryptocurrency to buy today.</p>\nTrust Wallet Token (TWT) - Top Cryptocurrency Wallet Ecosystem\n<p>Trust Wallet Token (TWT) should be on the radar for those considering which crypto to buy. The TWT token is the official token of Trust Wallet, a mobile-based cryptocurrency wallet that boasts extensive support for over 250,000 distinct assets across 33 blockchains&mdash;an ideal choice for anyone looking to make the best crypto investments. The \"Earn\" feature in the Trust Wallet allows users to generate passive income simply by pressing a button. Accessibility is central to Trust Wallet's design, with no KYC verification or barriers to trading cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>TWT, a token based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), is fast garnering attention, mainly due to the benefits it offers its holders. These include participating in governance activities, voting on crucial decisions for the Trust Wallet app, and receiving discounts for buying cryptocurrencies within the ecosystem&mdash;elements seriously worthy of consideration for those figuring out what crypto to invest in.</p>\nRender (RNDR): Revolutionizing the Rendering Process\n<p>Render, an innovative platform revolutionizing the rendering process, connects artists and GPU providers. This is achieved through the power of blockchain and cutting-edge technologies. The platform streamlines the creation of high-quality 3D graphics and animations. Artists can access powerful GPUs to render their works at affordable costs, using RNDR tokens to pay for the rendering services.

This is due to its unique proposition, linking providers of GPU power with those who need it, combined with its potential to disrupt the rendering industry. By tokenizing GPU power, Render allows miners to monetize their idle resources, making RNDR one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies for individuals looking to invest in a transformative project.</p>\nLitecoin (LTC): The Silver to Bitcoin's Gold\n<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been prominent in cryptocurrency since its inception in 2011. The \"silver to Bitcoin's gold\" is what makes Litecoin one of the best digital currencies for boosting their portfolio. An open-source project based on the Bitcoin protocol, Litecoin features several significant improvements, such as a faster block generation time and a different hashing algorithm.</p>\n<p>With its longevity in the crypto market and the backing of an active developer community, Litecoin continues to be an appealing option for investors.
