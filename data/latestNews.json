    "description": "<p>Vanguard Group, which manages $7.2 trillion in assets, has significantly ramped up its investments in the bitcoin mining sector, with its total stake now exceeding $560 million.</p>\nVanguards bitcoin mining investments\n<p>The company has been snapping up shares of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two major players in the Bitcoin mining space. Vanguard now holds 17.5 million shares of Marathon Digital, a 60% increase from its previous position. Given Marathon's current share price of $16.03, this puts the value of Vanguard's investment at a cool $280.5 million.</p>\n<p>But Vanguard didn't stop there. It also boosted its holdings in Riot Blockchain, a Colorado-based Bitcoin miner. Vanguard now owns 17.9 million shares of Riot, an 18% increase from its previous stake. This additional investment is worth over $281 million, pushing Vanguard's total investment in Bitcoin mining firms to a whopping $560 million.</p>\nAn institutional change of heart\n<p>This is all quite surprising given Vanguard's stance just two years ago. Back then, the company had been very sceptical about the long-term investment potential of cryptocurrencies. However, much water has since flowed under the bridge and now Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of Marathon Digital.</p>\n<p>Not just Vanguard, but the broader financial industry, seems to be warming up to cryptocurrencies. Last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an \"international asset&rdquo;, and &ldquo;digitised gold\". BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, recently applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It's also the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital.</p>\nBitcoin mining big business\n<p>Bitcoin mining, once a niche activity, has evolved into a big business. Today's miners are large operations that use server farms and consume a lot of energy. In return for their efforts in verifying blockchain transactions, they're rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. It's a high-stakes game, and it seems Vanguard is betting big on its players.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-token-bone-surges-88-too-late-to-buy/",
    "description": "The Shiba Inu ecosystem token Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) has seen a staggering 88% price increase within the last 28 days, since Jun 15. Last Saturday, the price rally stopped for the time being at just under $1.50, which means that the Shiba Inu-based token has already experienced an interim price increase of over 120%. Since then, the BONE price has been in a consolidation. A look at the 1-day chart of BONE shows that the price initially shot above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, but failed to defend the gains on a daily basis and eventually fell below the resistance. Thus, the $1.38 level is the key resistance. The current correction has caused the overheated daily RSI to reset from 81 to 61. Still, further consolidation might be needed to ignite further upside potential. A target for bears could be the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA)and the 38.2% Fibonacci level in the $1.00 to $1.01 range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming After a potentially necessary reset of technical indicators and another breakout above $1.38, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.50 and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.80 would then be the next targets before the all-time high of late February 2023 at $2.10 would be within reach. Shiba Inu: Reasons For The BONE Price Rally The main reason for the current rally in the price of Shibaswap Bone (BONE) can be seen in the announcement by Shiba Inu chief developer Shytoshi Kusama about the launch of Shibarium next month. BONE will be the governance token of the upcoming highly anticipated layer 2 network and will also serve as a gas token. As NewsBTC reported, Kusama published a new blog post last week stating that Shibarium will &#8220;likely&#8221; be unveiled at the Blockchain Futurist Conference. The conference will be held on August 15 and 16 in Toronto, Canada. Related Reading: Breaking: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Reveals Shibarium Release Date, SHIB Up 3% BONE will then not only be the official governance token for Shibarium, but will also be used for any payment of transaction fees (gas fees) on Shibarium. Thus, BONE will get a great utility that did not exist before. Undoubtedly, this will increase the demand for BONE. Traders might currently try to front-run the news. In classic crypto fashion, the event could become a &#8220;buy the rumor, sell the news&#8221; event. Investors should therefore be cautious. Worth noting: While BONE is rallying strongly, Shiba Inu has fallen -1.5% in the last seven days. The popular dog-themed cryptocurrency managed to break out of a multi-month downtrend channel, but currently lacks momentum to confirm the breakout. While BONE is benefiting from the Shibarium news, SHIB investors seem to remain skeptical and suffer from the launch delays. The network was originally scheduled for a 2022 release.
