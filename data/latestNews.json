Despite a hostile U.S. regulatory environment, large institutions are pushing for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-interview-charles-edwards\">Bitcoin financial instruments</a> which may spark a bull run.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/brace-for-impact-18-7m-in-sui-set-to-flood-the-market-what-to-expect/",
    "description": "The Sui Network, known for its fast-paced growth and community support, is on the verge of a notable event. On September 3rd, a massive amount of SUI tokens, worth roughly $18.7 million, will¬†be unlocked. Given its nature and the significant sum involved, this move could have some implications for the altcoin&#8217;s market dynamics in the coming days. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Limbo As Bitcoin Dominance Bounces Off Key Support A Rewarding Gesture For The Early Birds? The details surrounding this unlocking event have been transparently shared with the public. According to Token Unlocks, a crypto monitoring platform, this release will encompass 35.6 million SUI tokens. This quantity represents roughly 5% of the current circulating supply and interestingly, a predominant portion of these tokens could be earmarked for the network&#8217;s early supporters. üö® Notable Unlocks Alert üö® üóìÔ∏è Save the date [ September 3rd ] üóìÔ∏è üîì In three days, 35.6 million $SUI will be unlocked, equivalent to a value of 18.7 million dollars üî• Get ready and mark your calendar! Reference:https://t.co/58X45YBAzy pic.twitter.com/zVwTuECUaS ‚Äî Token Unlocks (@Token_Unlocks) August 30, 2023 With this event, chances are that some of the scheduled unlocked tokens could likely be used to reward SUI&#8217;s Active Contributors and Early Supporters (ACES) program. As instituted by the SUI developer, Mysten Labs, earlier this year, the ACES program was crafted as a gesture of gratitude. It aimed to acknowledge and reward those SUI discord members whose contributions were pivotal before the altcoin&#8217;s mainnet launch. Moreover, alongside this unlocking, data from Token Unlocks suggest that SUI also intends to set aside a portion of the unlocked tokens for staking incentives. What To Expect From SUI? With such a significant amount set to unlock, the temptation to sell might arise for some early supporters, especially if a portion is rewarded to Active Contributors and Early Supporters. This could potentially lead to a sell-off. Historically, massive token unlocks have sometimes resulted in short-term price depressions, given the increased market supply. Furthermore, the network, which has seen rapid expansion, has also recorded a user base jump from 3 million to 5 million users in a mere 14 days and then further to 6 million active accounts within another three days.

And even in the past 24 hours, the bloodbath continues as the asset records a 1.3% decline with a market price of $0.49 at the time of writing. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"
