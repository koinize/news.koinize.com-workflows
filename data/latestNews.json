This attack exposed vulnerabilities across DeFi projects and sparked efforts to recover stolen funds over the past few days, hammering the performance of tokens and even stablecoins as a result of the dramatic ups and downs in this story. As the community navigates the aftermath of this exploit, Cointelegraph compiled the weeks events, presenting a timeline of what happened since the hack on July 30.</p><h2 id=\"h-us-doj-is-concerned-about-a-run-on-binance-should-prosecutors-bring-fraud-charges\"><strong>US DoJ is concerned about a run on Binance should prosecutors bring fraud charges</strong></h2><p>The United States Department of Justice is reportedly considering <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-concerned-binance-run-prosecutors-fraud-charges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >charging cryptocurrency exchange Binance with fraud</a>, but hesitating based on costs to consumers. According to people familiar with the matter, Justice Department officials are concerned about an indictment against Binance causing a run similar to what happened with FTX in November 2022. The officials are considering fines or non-prosecution agreements for Binance rather than criminal charges in an effort to reduce the harm to consumers. Binance has been <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-justice-department-investigating-binance-for-violating-russian-sanctions-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >targeted by a criminal probe</a> in the U.S. for allegedly violating the countrys sanctions on Russia and has also faced lawsuits from U.S. regulators.</p><h2 id=\"h-hong-kong-debuts-retail-crypto-trading-with-hashkey-and-osl\"><strong>Hong Kong debuts retail crypto trading with HashKey and OSL</strong></h2><p>Digital asset firm HashKey <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-hong-kong-debuts-retail-crypto-trading-with-hash-key-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has successfully obtained all necessary licensing</a> to broaden its business from serving professional investors to taking on retail users, as Hong Kong expands its cryptocurrency trading to individual investors. The first license, Type 1, allows HashKey to operate a virtual asset trading platform under Hong Kongs securities laws. The second one, Type 7, officially enables the firm to provide automated trading services to both institutional and retail users. OSL, another local crypto firm, received an upgrade to its existing license from Hong Kongs Securities and Futures Commission, allowing it to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading to retail investors immediately.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><h2 id=\"h-coinbase-denies-sec-told-it-to-delist-everything-but-bitcoin\"><strong><strong>Coinbase denies SEC told it to delist everything but Bitcoin</strong></strong></h2><p>Coinbase <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-told-coinbase-delist-all-cryptocurrencies-but-bitcoin-brian-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has denied reports claiming that its CEO</a>, Brian Armstrong, was once told by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delist all cryptocurrencies on its platform except for Bitcoin.

According to a Coinbase spokesperson, however, the report is missing context and the SEC didn’t request Coinbase to delist any specific assets.
