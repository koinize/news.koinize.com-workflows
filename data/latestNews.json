Bulls were caught off-guard on Aug. 17 when over $213.5 million of longs were liquidated. This marked the largest single day of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ether-price-slump-crypto-bloodbath-1-b-liquidations\">Bitcoin long liquidations</a> since the Terra Luna collapse in May 2022. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/e88189cc-513b-469e-85f2-a011ccfba37f.jpeg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC futures long liquidation. Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure><p>When BTC longs are liquidated without buying pressure from trading volume, Bitcoin price is negatively affected. Bitcoin volume has also hit the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-volume-lowest-early-2021-25k\">lowest levels since</a> early 2021 and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-volume-dips-98-opensea-to-disable-royalty-tool-and-frend-tech-hype-nifty-newsletter\">BTC Ordinals volume</a> is down over 98%. </p><p>The absence of consistent trading volume has sent the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-fear-index-dips-amid-sec-binance-lawsuit\">Fear and Greed Index</a>, a key investor sentiment gauge, into a downtrend in the last 30-days switching from neutral sentiment to fear. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/b933a22c-5494-4649-9931-1fbf87ae6f65.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fear &amp; Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me</em></figcaption></figure><p>The short-term uncertainty in the crypto market does not appear to have changed institutional investors' long-term outlook. Despite a hostile U.S. regulatory environment, large institutions are pushing for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-interview-charles-edwards\">Bitcoin financial instruments</a> which may spark a bull run. Grayscale directly urged the SEC to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-sec-approve-all-bitcoin-etfs-together\">approve all Bitcoin</a> ETFs. </p><p>Despite the urgency of major financial firms, the SEC seems poised to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-2024\">continue to delay</a> decisions on approving Bitcoin ETFs until 2024 and this could be negatively impacting investor sentiment and price action across the crypto market. </p><h2>Bitcoin’s options continue to surge</h2><p>Bitcoin’s market structure had been recovering since the start of 2023, but its recent price action has turned the market structure bearish. Despite the surging of Bitcoin open interest, there is a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-open-interest-at-ytd-high-doesnt-move-prices-but-traders-can-rely-on-bots\">lack of consolidation</a> above $30,000. </p><p>The surge in open interest is leading some analysts to believe a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/latest-bitcoin-price-correction-reveals\">sharp correction back</a> to $29,000 is possible. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/market-releases/bitcoin-overconfidence-bulls-reclaim-27-8-k-trader\"><strong><em>Bitcoin 'overconfidence reigns' but bulls must reclaim $27.8K — Trader</em></strong></a></p><p>While some investors have speculated that BlackRock may be suppressing Bitcoin price ahead of their eventual ETF launch, the argument seems to be a conspiracy as they have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-lose-bitcoin-price-crash-btc-etf\">more to lose</a> from a BTC price crash. </p><p>Despite the current Bitcoin price downturn, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-btc-price-148k-july-2025-pantera-capital\">Pantera Capital</a> believes BTC could hit $148,000 by July 2025. </p><h2>Will short term pain in macro lead to long-term gains in crypto?</h2><p>Bitcoin price continues to be directly impacted by macroeconomic events, and it is also likely that further regulatory actions and interest rate hikes will continue having some effect on BTC price. This has led <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-vc-inflows-drop-further-as-macro-factors-weigh-on-investments\">crypto VC</a> inflows to drop by 10.26% according to Cointelegraph research. </p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is giving a speech on Aug. 25 in Jackson Hole that may give insight into whether the Fed will continue with aggressive interest rate policies.</p><p>Brian D. Evans, CEO of BDE Ventures, provided insight into how macro events can impact the current Bitcoin price action,</p><blockquote>“Economic growth is still relatively steady, even if there are signs of weakness. Inflation is clearly falling. And central banks are clearly willing and ready to provide a tremendous amount of liquidity to bolster wobbling banking systems and stimulate faltering economies. I suspect, then, that we’ll experience a prolonged bout of sideways chop. And the permabears will once again be stuck on the sidelines when the market eventually takes the next leg upward.”</blockquote><p>In the long term, market participants still expect the price of Bitcoin to recover, especially as more financial institutions are seemingly embracing BTC. </p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

According to the founders, their goal is not to scale, but rather to assist crypto founders working on early-stage startups to launch and grow their projects.</p><p>“Crypto has become more global, so it’s not the same circle and group you might have seen in 2018-2020, and we want to be able to help more people,” Mirza Uddin, one of the co-founders, said. Aside from Vessel, Uddin is also head of business development at Injective Labs. </p><p>Other co-founders include Eric Chen, CEO of the Injective protocol, and Anthony Anzalone, co-founder of Burnt (formerly Burnt Finance), a Web3 firm building XION, a layer-1 blockchain for consumer adoption.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ I'm excited to announce the public launch of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VesselVC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VesselVC</a>, the operator led Web3 fund for early stage startups.<br><br>Together with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericinjective?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ericinjective</a> and Anthony, our goal was to build a new venture model that actually aligns us with the success of our founders.<a href=\"https://t.co/3g8RnFgyTD\" data-amp=\"https://techcrunch-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/vessel-capital-emerges-from-stealth-with-55m-fund-focused-on-web3-infrastructure-and-apps/amp/\">https://t.co/3g8RnFgyTD</a></p>— Mirza  (@TheMirza_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMirza_/status/1694742055048851518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 24, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The fund's resources will be deployed over a five-year period. Their experience as founders of startups puts Vessel in a better position to understand entrepreneurs' needs, believes Uddin. “Oftentimes, [VCs] don’t have expertise in the things they’re investing in,” he noted, adding that “the world has enough VCs, but what’s actually missing is actual guidance and advice.\" He continued: </p><blockquote>“Most times you’ll get a nice check, a pretty logo on your website, but other than that VCs don’t help much aside from intros from time to time.“</blockquote><p>Vessel's debut comes amid a downturn in crypto venture capital. According to data from the<a href=\"https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/detail/venture-capital-database\"> Cointelegraph Research Venture Capital Database</a>, June saw a 29.73% decline in investment deals, with just $779.32 million raised from 62 transactions. The VC giant Sequoia Capital recently<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sequoia-capital-slashes-crypto-fund-after-industry-collapses\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sequoia-capital-slashes-crypto-fund-after-industry-collapses/amp\"> downsized its cryptocurrency fund</a> from $585 million to $200 million, citing a liquidity crunch and a shift to smaller crypto firms.</p><p>Web3 infrastructure, however, remains a popular investment target. Earlier this week, Binance's venture capital arm, Binance Labs,<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-labs-invests-zkproof-web3-development-infrastructure\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-labs-invests-zkproof-web3-development-infrastructure/amp\"> announced a strategic investment</a> into Delphinus Lab’s zero-knowledge WebAssembly (zk-WASM) virtual machine, which supports zero-knowledge proof computation. </p><p>“Web3 infrastructure and applications will fundamentally redefine the very fabric of a new Internet economy, leading to a far more innovative, decentralized and capital efficient society,\" <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7100508526032130050/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> Uddin on LinkedIn.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/recursive-inscriptions-bitcoin-supercomputer-defi-aws-possible/\"><strong><em> Recursive inscriptions — Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template>\n</p>\n                \n            "
