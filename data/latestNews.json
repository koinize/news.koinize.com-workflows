According to the request, the appellate court violated procedure in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/montenegro-court-do-kwon-extradition-south-korea\">rejecting an appeal</a> from Kwon’s legal team. It argued only the Supreme Court had the authority to adopt a legal decision in the case.</p><p>Montenegrin courts have been weighing whether to grant extradition of Kwon to the United States or South Korea, where he could face criminal charges related to his role in the downfall of Terraform Labs. Following a decision on March 20, it appeared that the Terraform Labs co-founder was going to be extradited to South Korea. However, prosecutors suggested that the supreme court could “issue a verdict that would change the Court’s decision.”</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/do-kwon-extradition-montenegro-supreme-court\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "
