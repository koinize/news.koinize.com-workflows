He wrote:</p><blockquote>“When the government learned this week that this article was forthcoming, defense counsel confirmed that the defendant had met with one of the article’s authors in person and had shared documents with him that were not part of the government’s discovery material.”</blockquote><p>The attorney went on to say that based on the excerpts in the article, the documents “do not appear to be within the discovery materials in the case, but likely came from the defendant’s personal Google Drive account.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-claims-portal-unavailable-after-going-live\"><strong><em>FTX claims portal becomes unavailable shortly after going live</em></strong></a></p><p>Williams then wrote that the U.S. federal rules of civil procedure prohibit lawyers and their agents from releasing non-public information that may interfere with a fair trial. As such, the government requests that the court enter an order, pursuant to Local Rule 23.1, which proscribes “extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses” that are likely to interfere with the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Williams added:</p><blockquote>“Having the story appear in a reputable newspaper with a worldwide readership without identifying the defendant as the source lends a misleading patina of legitimacy to what would otherwise be naked advocacy, compounding the risk of tainting prospective jurors.”</blockquote><p>Cointelegraph reached out to the DOJ and SBF’s defence attorneys, but did not get an immediate response.

Some industry observers also attributed the collapse to the massive bear market of 2022, as well as deeper issues related to the link between FTX and Alameda.</p><p>Subsequently, after SBF’s crypto empire imploded, as many as seven lawsuits were filed against him already by early December 2022.
