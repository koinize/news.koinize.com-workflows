    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/1000x-xrp-price-rise-to-594/",
    "description": "Crypto exchange Changelly has laid out an all-encompassing price prediction for XRP. As part of this prediction, the platform stated that the crypto token would rise to as high as $594 and gave a definite timeline for when this would happen.  When Will XRP Price Rise To $594? Changelly predicts that XRP will rise to $594 in 2050, with that representing the maximum price level that the crypto token can attain by then. Meanwhile, $512 and $540 are predicted as what will be the minimum and average prices for XRP during that same timeframe.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Increase Their Holdings By $3 Billion – Is A Price Surge Imminent? Changelly also gave a breakdown of what XRP’s price would be in the years leading up to 2050. Interestingly, they do not foresee XRP rising above $1 in 2024, as they put XRP’s maximum price this year at $0.85521447. A rise to above $1 is, however, expected in 2025 as the crypto exchange puts XRP’s maximum price in the year at $1.25. Interestingly, while crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto have predicted that XRP will rise to $27 in the next bull run, Changelly doesn’t see that happening anytime soon. Instead, based on their prediction, the earliest that XRP can hit that price level is sometime after the year 2033. They predict that the maximum price the crypto token can achieve in 2033 is $23.94. That price level is a far cry from Egrag’s prediction, which puts XRP’s price at $2,500 as early as 2029. Only time will tell which predictions come true as analysts continue to make bullish predictions for XRP’s price. So far, the crypto token hasn’t shown any positive sign to suggest that these bold predictions are attainable.  XRP price resumes uptrend &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Update On XRP’s Price Action Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently provided an update on XRP’s current price action using the daily timeframe. He noted that XRP had moved toward the $0.52 and $0.53 price range as expected. Specifically, the crypto token is said to have closed above $0.5286, which was the target area, and had a break on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Related Reading: Here Are The Major Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $42,000 The crypto analyst claims that this is a “great sign” for XRP as it attempts to break through the $0.60 resistance level. Dark Defender seemed optimistic about this happening soon as he expressed his joy that everything is going well for XRP on the chart at the moment.  He stated that he would be more excited if XRP broke $0.6649 and then proceeded with the “initial Fibonacci target of Wave 3 at $1.88.”  At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.52, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from The Cryptonomist, chart from Tradingview.com"
