    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitwise-ceo-bitcoin-ipo-moment-what-it-means-for-price/",
    "description": "In a statement via X (formerly Twitter), Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest, shared insights from a recent memo to advisors and institutional clients penned by Matt Hougan, Bitwise&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer. The memo heralded the onset of a new era for Bitcoin, likening its current trajectory in the financial markets to having an &#8216;initial public offering&#8217; (IPO) moment, signaling a major shift in price discovery mechanisms for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin&#8217;s IPO Moment Hougan&#8217;s memo elaborates on the seismic shift within the Bitcoin investment landscape, stating, &#8220;Previously, only a fraction of the world’s investors could access Bitcoin—mostly self-directed retail investors and technologists. That group drove the price above $40,000. Now, thanks to the ETFs, every investor in the world—financial advisors, family offices, institutions, endowments, and others—can access Bitcoin.&#8221; This transition is likened to &#8220;going from 10 normal people bidding on a house to 100 very wealthy people bidding on a house, overnight,&#8221; thus naturally propelling the price upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges To New 26-Month High, ‘Whales Go Parabolic’ As Analyst Forecasts Rally Toward $60,500 Emphasizing the magnitude of this shift, the memo reads, &#8220;It’s like bitcoin had its initial public offering and the market is now finding its true price,&#8221; underlining the transformative impact of ETFs in democratizing access to Bitcoin for a global pool of investors. With the world&#8217;s asset and wealth managers controlling approximately $115 trillion in capital, a modest allocation of 1% to Bitcoin could result in over $1 trillion of buying pressure, a figure that is approximately equal to Bitcoin&#8217;s current market capitalization. The memo also draws attention to the pivotal role of long-term Bitcoin holders in this new era of price discovery. With Bitcoin ETFs acquiring more than the total new supply generated by miners, the decision of these long-term holders to sell or hold could significantly influence market dynamics. Hougan notes, &#8220;Close to 70% of all bitcoin hasn’t moved in a year,&#8221; suggesting a robust holding pattern among investors which could set the stage for price escalations as demand continues to surge. Related Reading: Ethereum Leaves Bitcoin Behind, But Is This Rally Sustainable? Further reinforcing Bitwise&#8217;s bullish outlook, Ryan Rasmussen, a researcher at the firm, provided a tangible price target during a Yahoo Finance interview. He affirmed, &#8220;We think that Bitcoin will certainly set all-time highs in 2024&#8230;We still stand by that prediction. [&#8230;] That previous price is around $69,000, but we think it won&#8217;t stop there, we will see at least a 10-15% bump over the all-time high [&#8230;] That would take us to [&#8230;] $88,000, and I am still sticking by that with all the excitement in the market.&#8221; &#34;Ultimately what we&#39;re seeing is crypto kind of rising from the ashes of the 2022 market,&#34; Bitwise&#39;s @RasterlyRock says on the crypto rally. &#34;We think that we&#39;re in a multi-year bull cycle and all elements of the crypto space will certainly have their moment.&#34; pic.twitter.com/Fj1ohKUwjS &#8212; Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) February 26, 2024 These projections and analyses from Bitwise&#8217;s leadership highlight a consensus view of Bitcoin entering a groundbreaking phase of price discovery. The narrative of Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8216;IPO moment&#8217;, coupled with expanded investor access through ETFs and the steadfastness of long-term holders, crafts a compelling forecast of growth and new price benchmarks for the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.
