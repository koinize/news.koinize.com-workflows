    "description": "Ethereum price faced rejection and dropped from the $3,650 zone. ETH retested the $3,320 support and might start another increase. Ethereum started another decline and traded below the $3,500 support zone. The price is trading below $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the $3,450 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price struggled to continue higher above the $3,650 resistance. ETH faced rejection and started a fresh decline below the $3,550 level, like Bitcoin. There was a sharp move below the $3,500 and $3,450 levels. Finally, it retested the $3,320 support zone. A low was formed at $3,324 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3,360 level. Ethereum is now trading below $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,400 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,654 swing high to the $3,324 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,420 level and the trend line. The next key resistance sits at $3,450, above which the price might test the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,654 swing high to the $3,324 low. The next key resistance is seen near the $3,520 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which Ether could gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $3,650 barrier. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com If there is a move above the $3,650 resistance, Ethereum could even climb toward the $3,720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $3,880. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,420 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,320 level. The first major support is near the $3,250 zone. The next key support could be the $3,220 zone. A clear move below the $3,220 support might send the price toward $3,120. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,040 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Level – $3,320 Major Resistance Level – $3,420"
