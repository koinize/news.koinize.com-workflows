    "description": "While other industries like entertainment and loyalty programs have the potential to onboard millions of new users into Web3, gaming provides fertile ground for the seeds of mass adoption. Gamers are already familiar with virtual currency and understand how to buy and earn in-game assets. And while there are nearly 8 billion people in the world, over 3 billion of us play video games pointing to a considerable amount of the population primed for a gamified digital future."

Find out what is driving the price forward on this week’s episode of Market Talks.</p>\n                    <p><p>In this week’s episode of <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-HcIk8DKvOhCXPqNeNf9LK9R2z_kzzlN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Market Talks</a>, Cointelegraph welcomes Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics. Greenspan is an experienced financial analyst and a certified consultant who enjoys engaging with his 50,000+ Twitter followers about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency sector. He finds his passion in understanding financial markets and sharing his knowledge with others to help them make better investment decisions.</p><p>In today’s discussion, we first find out what Greenspan has been up to since we last had him on the channel — more than five years ago. We also get some insights into his company, Quantum Economics, what they do, their team, and what their vision is.</p><p>Without wasting any time, Greenspan dives into some of this hot takes by claiming that we are already in the next “Bitcoin summer” and that prices are just going to go up from here. He shows us his reasoning by going over some Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) charts, particularly the Bitcoin dominance chart, and taking us through his thought process.</p><p>With everything happening in the markets right now, both in the crypto and stock markets, we ask Greenspan what the most important things happening at the moment are capturing his attention and why. He explains to us why he finds the correlation between the stock market and Bitcoin so interesting and what he thinks that means for the future price of the asset.</p><p>There could be a number of reasons why the price of Bitcoin has been going up recently. We ask Greenspan what he thinks is the catalyst behind the recent pump all the way up to $30,000. Does it have anything to do with BlackRock and Fidelity putting more money into Bitcoin?</p><p>Next, we discuss what is pushing Bitcoin adoption, especially in developing economies. What benefits does Bitcoin offer that the traditional financial system cannot or chooses not to offer? </p><p>Greenspan also explains to us why stocks are in a bull market at the moment in light of the current macroeconomic environment — especially with interest rates and inflation so high. He also reveals why he only keeps less than $1,000 in his bank account and why he is solely focused on Bitcoin.</p><p>A lot has been said about Ordinals on the Bitcoin network, with some people being for it because it adds to the function of Bitcoin and the network, while others have opposed it, as it takes away from Bitcoin’s primary reason for existence. Greenspan explains where he stands on the topic as he takes us through some graphs and charts to explain his point of view. </p><p>We cover all of this and more, so make sure to stay tuned until the end. Market Talks airs every Thursday, featuring interviews with some of the most influential and inspiring people from the crypto and blockchain industry.
