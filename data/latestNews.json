    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-fashion-volume-whale-activity-plunges/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows the Dogecoin volume and whale activity have plummeted recently, a possible indication that investors no longer have interest in the memecoin. Dogecoin Transaction Volume And Whale Transaction Count Have Declined As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, DOGE trading activity has become lower recently. There are two on-chain metrics of relevance here: the Transaction Volume and Whale Transaction Count. The former keeps track of the total amount of Dogecoin (in USD) involved in daily transaction activity on the network. A high value of this metric usually suggests that trading interest in the asset is high right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flies Above $47,300, But Watch Out For Extreme Greed On the other hand, the low metric implies not many traders are paying attention to the memecoin currently as little volume is transacted on the blockchain. The other metric of interest here, the &#8220;Whale Transaction Count,&#8221; measures the total number of transfers on the network that are at least $1 million. Unlike the Transaction Volume, which provides information about the network in general, the Whale Transaction Count specifically tells us about the activity being displayed by the whales. The whales are the largest entities on the chain, so they can hold some influence in the market. As such, their activity can affect cryptocurrency in one way or another. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Volume and Whale Transaction Count over the last few months: Looks like both of these metrics have registered a decline in recent days &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, both the Dogecoin Transaction Volume and Whale Transaction Count have recently seen a drawdown towards relatively low levels. This would imply that interest in the asset from both the whales and retail investors may have waned in the memecoin. Generally, when buying and selling activity is high, DOGE is likelier to display some volatility. The chart shows that the volatile moves the coin has observed recently all saw the metrics register spikes. Since Dogecoin isn&#8217;t observing that many transactions at the moment, it&#8217;s possible that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price will continue to range in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Above $2,400: This Metric Points To Further Upside Any ignitions in the indicators can be to look out for, however, as they may be a predictor for a sharp move in the price. As these metrics only track whether trading activity is occurring rather than if buying or selling is taking place, any volatility arising from these spikes can take the price in either direction. DOGE Price While Bitcoin and other top digital assets have enjoyed profits recently, Dogecoin has slumped sideways, with returns standing utterly flat in the past week. Currently, DOGE is trading around the $0.08 level, as the chart below shows. The price of the coin has been consolidating recently &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView Due to Dogecoin&#8217;s recent poor performance, it lost its spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap list to Chainlink (LINK). If the coin&#8217;s struggle continues, it might slip further down the list, as Tron (TRX) is lurking just behind the asset now.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-price-hits-50000-the-big-question-how-much-higher-can-btc-go/",
    "description": "The Bitcoin price has experienced a significant surge, surpassing the $50,000 mark as Wall Street exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gained approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11.  This bullish momentum, coupled with increased ETF demand, has propelled Bitcoin into a fully-formed bull run just months ahead of the anticipated halving event, which is expected to further amplify the ongoing uptrend. Wall Street ETFs Drive Bitcoin Demand In a recent CNBC interview with Anthony Pompliano, it was revealed that Wall Street ETFs are buying approximately 12.5 times more Bitcoin per day than the network can produce.  This surge in demand from institutional investors has contributed to the price appreciation of Bitcoin. Pompliano asserts that Bitcoin has become Wall Street&#8217;s preferred asset and predicts that the increased demand through ETFs could lead to a significant rise in its price. Related Reading: ERC-404 Euphoria Push Ethereum Gas Fees To 8 Month High On the other hand, analytics firm Material Indicators has identified $53 million in Bitcoin buy orders stacked at the $50,000 level on the Binance order book. This substantial demand indicates strong investor interest in Bitcoin at this price point.  However, the firm believes that a price retest of support levels may be imminent, although the timing remains uncertain.  Bitcoin Price Rally Faces Potential Correction? If the Bitcoin price successfully breaks above the $50,000 level, Material Indicators anticipate minimal resistance on the path to $52,000 and $58,000. This scenario raises the possibility of a substantial short squeeze, as investors who have bet against the asset may be forced to cover their positions, further driving up the price.  However, the highly anticipated inflation report scheduled for Tuesday could potentially trigger a correction in the market, as its findings may impact investor sentiment and market dynamics. Related Reading: Top-Trader Picks Cardano As Bull Market Leader: Here’s Why Overall, Bitcoin&#8217;s price surge above $50,000 is attributed to the approval of Wall Street ETFs and the subsequent increase in institutional demand. The influx of capital from these ETFs has contributed to Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum, with expectations of further price appreciation.  As BTC continues to capture Wall Street&#8217;s attention, market participants eagerly await further developments and potential Bitcoin price movements to the upside, with potential corrections ahead.  Currently, the Bitcoin price has risen over 3.4% in the past 24 hours, coupled with a seven-day uptrend of 16%.
