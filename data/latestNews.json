The companies hope to improve document transfer and processing of financial transactions in the $32-trillion global trade ecosystem, Vodafone <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-dab-chainlink-lab-demonstrates-transformation-global-trade-blockchain-innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a>.</p><p>The proof-of-concept used oracle network Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). DAB “provide[d] security and interoperability across IoT devices at the edge of a network.” The proof-of-concept showed the potential of Vodafone Internet-of-Things devices and blockchains to provide data for use in contracts and AI applications. Potentially, a single interface could be created to transfer data and tokens, the company said: </p><blockquote>“For example, a vessel detecting a cargo fire could autonomously relay data to smart contracts via DAB’s platform and CCIP, potentially triggering a marine cargo insurance process.”</blockquote><p>Trade documents are a particular challenge because they may exist on paper or on digital platforms with low interoperability and need to change hands repeatedly.</p><p><strong><em> Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/swift-partners-with-chainlink-for-cross-chain-crypto-transfer-project\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/swift-partners-with-chainlink-for-cross-chain-crypto-transfer-project/amp\">SWIFT partners with Chainlink for cross-chain crypto transfer project</a></em></strong></p><p>International telecommunications company Vodafone <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/new-economy-of-things-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">launched</a> DAB in February 2022 and first used it with Mastercard in a trial in the United Kingdom of an app to help electric vehicle drivers find and pay for the best charging options. </p><p>Vodafone <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-sumitomo-corporation-launch-economy-of-things-venture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">teamed</a> up with Sumitomo in May.
