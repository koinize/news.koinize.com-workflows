    "description": "Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have unveiled a game-changing computational tool called LoGoFunc, designed to predict pathogenic gain- and loss-of-function variants within the human genome. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on loss of function, LoGoFunc&#8217;s revolutionary approach distinguishes between different harmful mutations, promising crucial insights into diverse disease outcomes.
