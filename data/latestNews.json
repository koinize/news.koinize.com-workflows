As Big Tech continues to innovate, small firms may be squeezed out of the space, he added.</p><p>The rapid development of consumer payment systems, particularly point-of-sale (POS) systems, has received little regulatory attention, in contrast to crypto assets, Chopra said:</p><blockquote>“Big Tech companies have crept into the payments ecosystem to deepen consumer engagement on their platforms, harvest and potentially monetize transactions-related data, and exploit traditional financial sector fee streams.”</blockquote><p>Apple and Google have come to be dominant in mobile payments, giving them outsized impact on consumers’ access to mobile payment solutions. “Tap-to-pay” near-field communications technology (NFC), for example, is gaining users rapidly but not spreading as widely as might be expected based on the way other apps have. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-cbn-enhances-e-naira-with-nfc-upgrade-for-contactless-payments\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-cbn-enhances-e-naira-with-nfc-upgrade-for-contactless-payments/amp\">Nigerian central bank adds NFC upgrade to eNaira for contactless payments</a></em></strong></p><p>Apple’s requirement that NFC payments made on Apple mobile devices be routed through Apple Pay is one of the hinderances the technology faces. Chopra said:</p><blockquote>“While I agree that strong challenges to the dominant Wall Street banks and card networks are important, there is real concern that the large technology firms will be able to erect even more gates and toll booths that will prevent small firms from emerging and succeeding.”</blockquote><p>In October, the CFPB will <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-kicks-off-personal-financial-data-rights-rulemaking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">propose</a> rules to give consumers more rights over their personal financial data. Those rules will encourage open banking and payments by allowing consumers to switch services more easily, the bureau assured. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/8843c8aa-db8c-4e01-a8a3-0e72c8a2cc27.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Point-of-sale payment methods compared.
