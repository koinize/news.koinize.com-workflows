    "description": "Avalanche (AVAX), the blockchain platform known for its scalability and infrastructure, made significant strides in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023. According to a report by Messari, AVAX emerged as one of the best-performing tokens, driving the protocol to record notable gains in key metrics. Record-Breaking Milestones For Avalanche  The report shows that AVAX experienced a notable increase in its market cap, which climbed 344% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 326% year-over-year (YoY), reaching $14.4 billion at the end of the year. This large increase propelled AVAX&#8217;s market cap rank among all tokens from 20 to 9, up 11 spots (currently 10th behind Cardano (ADA). Related Reading: BONK Price Jumps Over 30% As Robinhood, Revolut Listing Speculations Gain Traction One of the driving factors behind Avalanche&#8217;s significant revenue growth was the surge in inscriptions, particularly Avascriptions (ACS-20 tokens).  These on-chain call data transactions saw a significant boost, resulting in a substantial increase in revenue. From November to December, Avalanche witnessed a surge in revenue, with a 2,874% increase measured in USD, from $1.9 million to $56.5 million. The surge in revenue was accompanied by a significant increase in daily transactions, which jumped 450% QoQ to 1.5 million. The emergence of Avascriptions also drove the majority of these transactions. Avalanche&#8217;s C-Chain experienced a record-breaking 6.3 million transactions, with nearly 6.1 million being inscriptions. This marks the highest number of transactions ever recorded in a single day for Avalanche. While C-Chain saw a 50% QoQ decrease in daily active addresses, this was primarily due to decreased activity on LayerZero &#8211; a bridge between different blockchains. However, the report highlights that Avalanche saw a significant increase in active validators, growing 20% QoQ from 1,374 to 1,651 validators.  According to Messari, this growth in validators, coupled with an 11% QoQ increase in AVAX stakes, indicates a promising long-term appetite for AVAX in the coming year. Avalanche&#8217;s TVL Surges 78% Avalanche&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in USD experienced a substantial 78% QoQ increase, reaching $1.03 billion by the end of Q4 2023. This positioned Avalanche as the 7th chain by TVL, denominated in USD.  However, TVL-denominated in AVAX decreased by 71% QoQ, primarily due to AVAX price appreciation driving the increase in USD-denominated TVL. The report also sheds light on the performance of various protocols on Avalanche. AAVE, the largest protocol by TVL, witnessed a 60% QoQ growth, while Benqi and Trader Joe demonstrated strong gains of 205% and 131% QoQ, respectively. Together, these three protocols accounted for 79% of Avalanche&#8217;s TVL, showcasing their dominance in the ecosystem. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over: 2 Key Factors Behind The Momentum Smaller-sized protocols, such as Pangolin and GMX, also showcased impressive growth, while Balancer, aided by Benqi&#8217;s sAVAX liquidity pool, attracted significant TVL on Avalanche. Additionally, Q4 witnessed a surge in average daily DEX volumes, rising by 245% QoQ. Analysis of the 1-day chart reveals that Avalanche&#8217;s token trading pair AVAX/USD experienced significant growth during Q4, breaking free from a prolonged period of sideways price action. However, following a notable uptrend that propelled the token to reach $50, its highest level in 20 months, on December 24, AVAX underwent a sharp correction, plunging to the $27 price level.  The cryptocurrency has rebounded in response to Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) rally and the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market. Over the past fourteen days, AVAX has witnessed a 13% price increase, currently reclaiming the $40 zone. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"
