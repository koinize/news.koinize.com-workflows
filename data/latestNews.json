I was really shocked, she explains. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cant fix you  <a href=\"https://t.co/oyMLut3S2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/oyMLut3S2F</a></p><p> Irene Zhao (@Irenezhao_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Irenezhao_/status/1720685411838939641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >November 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p>Zhao reveals that Paul stumbled upon the project after billionaire crypto investor <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2022/mike-novogratz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Mike Novogratz</a> posted about it on Twitter. That kickstarted a friendship with Paul:</p><p>Logan followed me on Twitter and Instagram after he bought my NFTs, Zhao says, adding, however, that theyve never managed to meet up.</p><p>I was going to travel to Los Angeles, but at the time, he was somewhere in Puerto Rico. So, we didnt get to meet in the end. But we do have conversations about NFTs.</p><p>Rubbing virtual shoulders with big names like Paul is just a regular day in the life of a crypto influencer. Zhao boasts 194,300 Twitter followers, runs her own Web3 NFT platform company, SO-COL, and globe-trots to speak at crypto conferences.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I meet a lot of cool and successful people, and they all have very interesting personalities. Otherwise, they wouldnt choose crypto as a career because its a very dynamic and very fast-paced career industry.</p></blockquote><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What led to Twitter fame?</h2><p>Zhao had already built a following as a social media influencer in the Web2 space, and much like Bitcoiners orange-pilling their friends, she has introduced most of her followers to NFTs.</p><p>I have been building my own personal branding as a key opinion leader across various social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube. So, right now, I have about half a million followers across all platforms.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ive been an IG influencer since my university days.

I dont really own my content or my community.</p></blockquote><p>Zhao set up one of the first Simp DAOs, where NFT purchasers could join her Irene DAO fan club and get closer to their Simp Queen. She later spun this idea out for the SO-COL platform.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In my health is wealth era</p><p>Im so ready for the road trip with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/truck_memecoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >@truck_memecoin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2Wh1TqsIps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/2Wh1TqsIps</a></p><p> Irene Zhao (@Irenezhao_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Irenezhao_/status/1719658695624393122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >November 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p>Zhao jokingly mentions that shes a big deal in Asia but can roam under the radar in the Western world:</p><p>They recognize me, especially in Asia, but in the Western world, the white people cant really recognize Asian people.
