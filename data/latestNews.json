The authority added:</p><blockquote>“Holders of crypto-assets and clients of crypto-asset service providers will not benefit during that period from any EU-level regulatory and supervisory safeguards [...] such as the ability to file formal complaints with their NCAs [National Competent Authorities] against crypto-asset service providers.”</blockquote><p>Even after December 2024, there is no guarantee investors will be fully protected by MiCA up to 2026. After MiCA becomes applicable to crypto asset service providers in late 2024, member states still have the option of granting crypto service providers an additional 18-month “transitional period” allowing them to operate without a license, which is also referred to as a “grandfathering clause.”</p><p>“This means that holders of crypto-assets and clients of crypto-asset service providers may not benefit from full rights and protections afforded to them under MiCA until as late as July 1, 2026,” the ESMA wrote. Most NCAs will have limited powers to supervise those who benefit from the transitional period, depending on local laws.</p><p>“In most cases, these powers are confined to those available under existing anti-money laundering regimes, which are far less comprehensive than MiCA,” the ESMA added.</p><p>Retail investors must be aware that there will be no such thing as a “safe” crypto asset even once MiCA is implemented, the authority stressed, stating:</p><blockquote>“ESMA reminds holders of crypto-assets and clients of crypto-asset service providers that MiCA does not address all of the various risks associated with these products. Many crypto-assets are by nature highly speculative.”</blockquote><p>The latest warnings from the ESMA come shortly after the regulator <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-regulator-publishes-second-consultation-on-mica\">released a second consultative paper</a> on MiCA on Oct. 5 after <a href=\"https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica#:~:text=The%20Markets%20in%20Crypto%20Assets,deadline%20depending%20on%20the%20mandate).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">enforcing</a> the regulations in June 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-regulations-large-ai-models\"><strong><em>EU mulls more restrictive regulations for large AI models: Report</em></strong></a></p><p>During the implementation phase of MiCA, the ESMA and other related authorities are responsible for consulting with the public on a range of technical standards that are expected to be published sequentially in three packages.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/5d0aa6f5-133e-42da-a42d-dc53a85bd0b9.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MiCA implementation timeline.
