This understanding affords involved parties the privilege to appeal subsequent to the finalization of the case. This procedural strategy, intended to enhance the efficiency of the legal proceedings, aims to avoid continuous disruptions to the main case due to multiple appeals concerning minor decisions.</p><p>Following Judge Torres' pivotal ruling that XRP does not fall under the classification of security, the SEC <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-seek-interlocutory-appeal-ripple-case\">has submitted an appeal plea</a>. This move by the SEC, although prompted by the favorable verdict for Ripple, focuses on an unforeseen development within the legal proceedings.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.<br><br>You can see why there would be a rule like…</p>&mdash; David &quot;JoelKatz&quot; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1692668467122487627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The CTO stressed that combining appeals is vital to make things work better. This is important because having separate appeals could make the legal process take even longer. Usually, an appeal process lasts for at least a year, and if there are many appeals while the case is ongoing, it could make the legal proceedings slow and difficult, maybe even never-ending.</p><p>However, the CTO clarified that there's a rule for special situations. The SEC argues that the unique situation, in this case, is a reason to do things differently. It suggests stopping the process until the appeal is settled, but Ripple disagrees.</p><p>Ripple and its leaders believe that even if the SEC can appeal, the main lawsuit should keep going while the appeal process happens. This matches the idea of letting the trial continue and looking at appeals carefully when everything else is done.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-consensys-participate-in-mastercard-program-to-promote-cbdc-innovation\"><strong><em>Ripple, ConsenSys participate in Mastercard program to promote CBDC innovation</em></strong></a></p><p>The CTO provided more information because of rumors going around in the Bitcoin community. There were discussions that the SEC might want to appeal Judge Torres' decision to higher courts.
