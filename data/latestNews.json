USDC the second largest stablecoin’s market cap stands at $28.8 billion with a difference of over $50 billion.

Well, it’s not so simple, say lawyers</em></strong></a></p><p>The prominent reason for the decline in the market share of other stablecoins can be attributed to regulatory scrutiny shown by United States regulators added to the banking crisis. After a ban on new minting of BUSD alleging security violations, the BUSD market cap dropped rapidly as users started to convert their BUSD for other stablecoins. </p><p>Similarly for USDC, the major crisis came in the form of the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank where the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-depegs-as-circle-confirms-3-3b-stuck-with-silicon-valley-bank\">stablecoin issuer held about $3.3 billion in reserves</a>. This led to market panic and a subsequent depegging from the U.S. dollar. Although USDC re-pegged the next day it took a significant toll on its market cap as many converted their USDC to other stablecoins in fear of a total crash. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/moral-responsibility-how-blockchain-can-improve-ai-trustworthiness/\"><strong><em>‘Moral responsibility’ — Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
