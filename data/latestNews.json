    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-burn-major-milestone-1/",
    "description": "The total number of XRP tokens burned just recently hit a major milestone. This has raised questions as to how much impact these burns can have on the value of the XRP tokens in circulation. Interestingly, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz recently made some comments in this regard as he weighed in on whether or not XRP burns could affect the token’s value.  12 Million XRP Now Wiped Out Of Circulation Data from the XRP Scan shows that just over 12 million XRP tokens have now been burned and wiped out from circulation. This figure represents just 0.012% of XRP’s total available supply, which now stands at over 99.9 billion. Considering the magnitude of tokens still available, it is hard to imagine that the tokens burned so far can have so much impact on the token’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $0.087 Is A Key Profitable Level To Watch For Dogecoin It is also worth mentioning that the 12 million XRP burned so far is a cumulative total of all the tokens that have been wiped out from circulation since they were premined. As such, these tokens have been burned at separate times and not necessarily on a large scale. With this in mind, that could explain why the XRP community is calling for burns of Ripple’s XRP holdings.  Ripple currently has over 40 billion XRP in escrow. Burning a significant portion of these tokens could have more effect on the token&#8217;s price than the 12 million burned so far. However, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz doesn’t believe that this would yield “any real benefits.” He also alluded to how Stellar burning 55 billion XLM tokens in 2019 didn’t have much impact on the token’s price.  Token price falls below $0.6 &#124; Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com Ripple’s XRP Holdings Might Not Be The Problem Talks about Ripple burning or at least disposing of a significant portion of their XRP holdings continue to spring up in the XRP community. This is because of accusations that the crypto firm is responsible for XRP’s stagnant price based on the belief that they continue to dump their tokens on the market.    Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team’s Record 9.35 Billion SHIB Burn Sends Burn Rate Soaring These allegations, however, seem unfounded, considering that it has been reported that Ripple’s XRP sales do not have an impact on the token’s price on crypto exchanges. If anything, the crypto firm somehow provides stability to the ecosystem as they are known to perform buybacks at different periods.  Ripple burning their escrowed tokens is also not an easy task, as Ripple’s CTO seemed to suggest in his latest remarks. It has been said in the past that Ripple will likely need the approval of validators to carry out these burns.  A former Ripple Director had previously mentioned that Ripple could simply disable the master key on the destination account that receives these escrowed funds. However, there are no assurances that this could achieve the same purpose as the tokens being wiped out from circulation.  Featured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "description": "The past week has been a triumphant one for Lido DAO, with its LDO token surging an impressive 22%, leaving a sluggish broader crypto market in its dust. This notable feat mirrors the 18% ascent of Ethereum, its underlying blockchain, showcasing a deep synergy between the leading liquid staking platform and its technological foundation. But the good news doesn&#8217;t stop there. A staggering 87% of Lido DAO token holders are reaping the rewards of their investment, according to data from IntoTheBlock. This solid figure underscores the strong performance of LDO, attributed largely to its stellar weekly performance, as the crypto trading analytics platform noted. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Bets Big: ‘Perfect Storm’ Event To Slingshot Bitcoin To $1 Million Lido Holders Get Good Returns From Their Investment Following a strong price move by $LDO this week, ~87% of LDO addresses are now in profit. pic.twitter.com/3rLodKvK21 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 10, 2024 Furthermore, Lido&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL), a crucial metric reflecting the amount of cryptocurrency deposited in its protocol, has also ballooned a remarkable 19% in tandem with the price hike. Analysts attribute LDO&#8217;s ascent to a potent cocktail of factors. First and foremost, its symbiotic relationship with Ethereum. As the leading smart contract platform enjoys renewed momentum, projects built on its infrastructure – like Lido – relish the rising tide that lifts all boats. Furthermore, Lido&#8217;s recent bounce back from a critical support level at $2.80 appears to have ignited a bullish fervor. Technical indicators whisper of a potential retest of the $3.60 resistance barrier, suggesting further upward potential. Lido TVL. Source: Defillama Adding fuel to the fire is the skyrocketing demand for Ethereum staking. Lido&#8217;s user-friendly model allows investors to earn rewards on their ETH without locking them up for extended periods, a flexibility that resonates deeply with yield-hungry crypto enthusiasts. This, coupled with Lido&#8217;s robust platform and proven track record, is attracting new users at a steady pace. Strong TVL Numbers Put Lido In Contention The surging TVL is a testament to this burgeoning trust. As more users deposit their ETH on Lido, the total value locked in the protocol increases, further validating its platform and potentially attracting even more participants. This positive feedback loop could propel Lido towards solidifying its position as the premier Ethereum staking solution. LDO market cap currently at $3.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, a note of prudent caution remains. Lido&#8217;s recent upswing hasn&#8217;t been entirely organic. The absence of major platform-specific developments raises questions about the rally&#8217;s long-term sustainability. Additionally, a large token sale earlier triggered a temporary dip, highlighting the potential for volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Explodes Over 50% In Massive Price Jump – Here’s Why Technical analysis also suggests that breaking the $3.60 resistance is crucial for continued upward momentum. Failure to do so could lead to a pullback, and investors should be prepared for such a scenario. Ultimately, while Lido DAO is riding a wave of momentum, fueled by its association with Ethereum, its robust platform, and the ever-growing demand for liquid staking solutions, investors should approach with cautious optimism.

From performance to scalability, the network continues to implement improvements. Related Reading: Is Cardano The Next Solana? Institutional Investors Clamor For ADA Exposure Cardano has been regaining bullish momentum in the crypto market as the news of the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded (ETF) fund in the US pushed the sector higher. At the time of writing, ADA’s price trades at $0.5 with a 7% profit in the last week. Big Updates, Big Things In Store? Cardano Picks Up Bullish Momentum According to the report from Essential Cardano, the network saw the introduction of a new version of its client, v.8.7.3, by its core technology team. The update addresses an issue with the outbound governor function, causing communication problems across specific nodes and impacting network performance. On the other hand, the networking and consensus teams implemented an update on the decision logic used by a cluster run by IOG and integrated a new ledger database, respectively. These updates will allow the network to mitigate performance issues. The report noted that the Lace team fixed a bug in the wallet and services sector that affected the singData method, impacting the visualization of stake pool rewards. The team also fixed issues with reading minting transaction data, stake pool visualization, and transaction signatures. An official post stated the following regarding a new feature that gave users more freedom to synchronize their wallets: Using multi-address wallets with Lace just got smoother, with a new simple way to discover and sync new addresses. Ready to make your life easier? Go to ‘Wallet Sync’ in your settings to resync your multi-address wallet and discover new addresses.

Cardano Funding, Smart Contracts, And More On the smart contract side, the Cardano platform, Plutus, received an update to enhance its performance. In addition, the team implemented an update that allows the node to index consensus events and ledger states. This implementation represents a milestone in the platform’s long-term progress and in its capacity to deploy a queryable node, IOG noted. As in previous years, the Cardano ecosystem will stay focused on its community and in ways of promoting participation in its governance model. In that sense, the community awaits the release of a “constitution” to be agreed upon and voted by elected delegates.
