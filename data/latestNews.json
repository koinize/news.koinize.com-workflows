In supporting the decision, developers wrote:</p><blockquote>\"Reddit recently sparked controversy within its community following a decision to limit API access. This move provoked a series of 48-hour subreddit blackouts in protest. This price hike for their API has forced existing third-party developers to shut down as maintaining their applications becomes impossible.\"</blockquote><p>\"This controversy and others highlight the ongoing problems with centralized social media platforms,\" developers said, while also pointing out Elon Musk's <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-down-elon-musk-rate-limit-exceeded\">controversial decision</a> to impose reading limits on new and verified accounts on Twitter, citing \"extreme levels of data scraping &amp; system manipulation.\" Nader Al-Naji, founder of DeSo, highlighted a shift where users embrace autonomy over social content, as with owning Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) with money:</p><blockquote>\"These protests represent a broader societal shift. They are indicative of a new paradigm in how creators and users interact with social media.\"</blockquote><p>Founded in 2019, DeSo offers monetization features such as creator coins, nonfungible tokens, tokens, and tipping. The firm claims to store user identity, profiles, content, and social graph 100% on-chain, and these content cannot be banned or blocked on a protocol level. Recently, the firm released new in-app proposals such as Openfund 2.0, a decentralized exchange platform.</p><p>In September 2021, DeSo raised $200 million in funding led by a16z, Coinbase Ventures, Sequoia, Pantera Capital, and others, including, perhaps ironically, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Currently, over 150 projects are <a href=\"https://desolist.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">listed</a> on the DeSo community, although their market caps are somewhat small. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/decentralized-social-media-next-big-crypto-thing/\">Decentralized social media: The next big thing in crypto?</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
