    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/best-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-now-btc-shib-tcrv",
    "description": "<p>Regulations and lawsuits have become the bane of the crypto market&rsquo;s existence in the past few months. However, in a somewhat unexpected turn of events, this morning, we saw both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge in price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And as both tokens&rsquo; prices continue to go up, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) join Tradecurve (TCRV) as the top three best cryptocurrencies to buy now. But TCRV leads the way with its never-before-seen utility and game-changing potential.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>\nBitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s Unexpected Surge\n<p>Before settling at its current price, Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily shot up to $138,000 Binance earlier today. However, this doesn&rsquo;t depict the real Bitcoin (BTC) price, as it was probably caused by a glitch and was gone in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless, Bitcoin (BTC) holders were pleasantly surprised to see Bitcoin (BTC) surge this morning, increasing by almost $2,000 per Bitcoin (BTC) token compared to two days ago.</p>\n<p>Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $28,972.09, an 8.16% increase in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin (BTC) market cap and trading volume are also up by 8.19% and 80.65%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Is Recovering\n<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy again, as it managed to finally break out of its downward streak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This surge in price can be attributed to Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, who recently moved 21 billion SHIB over to Binance. However, even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently on the come-up, you should keep in mind that maybe those billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been moved to be sold later on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000007367, a 2.41% increase since yesterday. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap is also up by 2.51%, and the Shiba Inu (SHIB) trading volume is up by 41.53%.</p>\n<p></p>\nTradecurve (TCRV) &ndash; The Most Promising and Profitable Project in 2023\n<p>The best out of the three cryptocurrencies mentioned here is Tradecurve (TCRV). Why? Because Tradecurve brings a breath of fresh air into the market, giving access to something that has never been done before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tradecurve is a hybrid exchange platform that allows people to trade all kinds of assets and financial instruments from one account. Also, it has a borderless nature, meaning that it&rsquo;s accessible worldwide.

And once you use them to create an account, you&rsquo;ll be able to trade whenever you want, whatever you want, from wherever you are.</p>\n<p>Tradecurve also brings some exciting benefits, including access to AI algorithmic trading, copy trading, 500:1 trading leverage, ultra-fast order execution, discounts on trading fees, a Metaverse trading academy, and much more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, TCRV, Tradecurve&rsquo;s token, is in Stage 4 of its public presale, trading at $0.018. Its price has already jumped, realizing returns for early holders even during the presale. And before the presale ends, experts believe that the token will bring in 50x returns, with an additional 100x on the horizon once it hits exchanges.</p>\n<p>For more information about $TCRV presale tokens:</p>\n<p>Website: https://tradecurve.io/&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Buy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Telegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/expert-analysis-imf-documents-and-xc-platform-raise-concerns-for-xrp/",
    "description": "The IMF has often recognized crypto assets, especially Ripple (XRP), as instruments facilitating cross-border payments and remittances. Reuters reported that the International Monetary Fund IMF plans to launch a platform to facilitate CBDC creations and transactions.  These mentions have always excited the XRP community. But recently, a prominent XRP influencer opined that the new XC platform and IMF cross-border documents are not pro-XRP.   IMF Documents and Upcoming Platform Don&#8217;t Directly Favor XRP WrathofKahneman took to Twitter to quell the anticipation that the IMF favors XRP directly.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Appears To Be Fueled By Derivatives, Will It Last? The influencer wrote; Man, the IMF docs are neither pro-XRP nor the XC platform. There are 3 docs worth reading to decide for yourself. Recall that in 2018, the International Monetary Fund organized a presentation captioned The Regulation of Virtual Currencies. The body classified XRP as a coin for digital payments highlighting that it can facilitate cross-border payment, which has been a challenge for central banks.  Also, earlier in February, the IMF published a paper recognizing the importance of crypto assets such as XRP for cross-border payments and remittances.  Then on June 19, the IMF published another paper stating it plans to push through the launch of an XC platform where many wholesale central bank digital currency projects will interoperate.  According to the IMF report, this is an evolution of wholesale CBDC, which is both a settlement asset and infrastructure—a platform, really. But according to WOK, the XRP community exaggerated the whole plan implying support for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Become Greedy For First Time Since May In his tweet, WOK added the documents about the first XC platform proposal, the recent IMF report, and even director Tobias Adrian&#8217;s comments.  He stated clearly that these documents didn’t only mention Ripple but also pointed at its rivals, Bitcoin Lightning Network and Stellar Blockchain, implying that the network wasn&#8217;t unique as touted.  Regarding the XC platform, WOK said, &#8220;I think the IMF is trying to envision a single global cross-border clearinghouse. It&#8217;s cool but hard to imagine major economies sharing exposure so nakedly. They mention blockchain/crypto need not be used at all.&#8221; International Monetary Fund is Aware of Ripple and Stellar But Didn’t Indicate Adoption, WOK WOK&#8217;s tweet sparked discussion around the topic and Twitter user Salvacrypto asked him if the IMF&#8217;s mention of Stellar or Ripple could increase the probability of adopting the assets for future cross-border payments models or decrease it. The user even told him to give an honest answer. In response, WOK said, &#8220;If pushed, I would say slightly increase because it indicates to me they are aware of the XRPL and Ripple. But that doesn&#8217;t mean planning for them.&#8221; Following WOK’s answer, Salvacrypto responded that the XRP community members are excited that such recognition by IMF &#8220;stacks the chips in their favor.&#8221; XRP is currently changing hands at $0.499 at the time of this writing, up 1.34% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.
