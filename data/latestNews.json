Researchers know how to build the AI, and they know how AIs work at a fundamental, technical level. But what they actually do involves manipulating more numbers, patterns and algorithmic steps than a human can process in a reasonable amount of time. </p><p>For this reason, there’s no direct method by which researchers can trace an output to its source. When an AI model begs for its life, according to the researchers, it might be roleplaying, regurgitating training data by mixing semantics or actually reasoning out an answer — though it’s worth mentioning that the paper doesn’t actually show any indications of advanced reasoning in AI models. </p><p>What the paper does highlight is the challenges of penetrating the black box. Anthropic took a top-down approach to understanding the underlying signals that cause AI outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/anthropic-launches-claude-2-amid-continuing-ai-hullabaloo\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/anthropic-launches-claude-2-amid-continuing-ai-hullabaloo/amp\"><strong><em>Anthropic launches Claude 2 amid continuing AI hullabaloo</em></strong></a></p><p>If the models were purely beholden to their training data, researchers would imagine that the same model would always answer the same prompt with identical text. However, it’s widely reported that users giving specific models the exact same prompts have experienced variability in the outputs. </p><p>But an AI’s outputs can’t really be traced directly to their inputs because the \"surface” of the AI, the layer where outputs are generated, is just one of many different layers where data is processed. Making the challenge harder is that there’s no indication that a model uses the same neurons or pathways to process separate queries, even if those queries are the same.</p><p>So, instead of solely trying to trace neural pathways backward from each individual output, Anthropic combined pathway analysis with a deep statistical and probability analysis called \"influence functions\" to see how the different layers typically interacted with data as prompts entered the system.</p><p>This somewhat forensic approach relies on complex calculations and broad analysis of the models.

    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">MakerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) stalwart, is facing heightened scrutiny after the introduction of its new platform, Spark Protocol.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">The controversy arises from Spark Protocol's terms of service, which actively prevent users from accessing the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, it appears MakerDAO is attempting to restrict U.S. users from the platform, causing a ripple effect on global user rights and igniting concerns over privacy in the DeFi sector.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The decision to restrict VPN access follows closely on the heels of Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, announcing the potential for DAI stablecoin holders to earn up to 8% returns via the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on Spark Protocol. The appeal of these high yields comes from a system adjustment: when DSR adoption is sparse, the rate increases to attract users. Despite only 9% of DAI holders currently participating in DSR, the platform's mechanism automatically optimizes rates based on user engagement.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Despite these prospective states, behind this innovative yield mechanism lies a broader issue. The DeFi space, characterized by its decentralized ethos and user autonomy, is now confronting questions about the balance between regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Chris Blec, a DeFi analyst, voiced strong concerns over Spark Protocol's VPN restrictions. Blec's stance is that MakerDAO's decision could compromise global user privacy, potentially prioritizing profit motives over decentralized principles. </p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">This contention around user rights and access isn't isolated. Over the past year, DAI's market trajectory experienced turbulence. Its market cap plummeted by 43%, from $7B to $4B, after a destabilizing event in March when both DAI and USDC stablecoins momentarily dropped below their usual peg. Concerns arose about the solvency of USDC's banking partners, and since DAI's collateral heavily comprised USDC, both tokens suffered.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">MakerDAO's strategy, introducing high DSR yields through Spark Protocol, aims to bolster its position in the volatile stablecoin ecosystem. </p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">On the contrary, by blocking VPN access, MakerDAO has placed itself in the crosshairs of a larger debate around the intersection of regulatory compliance, decentralized operations, and user rights in the crypto domain.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">While it remains that there is a need to evaluate the implications of MakerDAO's recent decisions, the line between user privacy and platform governance is set to be a defining conversation in the industry's DeFi sector.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/heres-why-this-analyst-foresees-hedera-hbar/",
    "description": "Hedera popularly known as HBAR, has lately been drawing attention in the world of cryptocurrencies. An influencer from the crypto-sphere recently asserted that this digital currency is poised to cement its position among the top 10 in the industry. HBAR&#8217;s Position In The Upcoming Bull Market Classy Crypto, a crypto-focused YouTube channel, hosted a discussion where the anchoring influencer laid out his reasoning, foreseeing HBAR&#8217;s substantial ascent in the near future. According to the host of Classy Crypto, HBAR is not just positioned to rise but is also primed to become one of the biggest beneficiaries in the anticipated bull run. Related Reading: HBAR Token Scores Impressive Gains As Major Cryptos Nosedive The host noted that one factor driving this optimism is the forthcoming Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Trust Funds (ETFs). As these ETFs come into play, they are expected to usher a wave of institutional investors into the crypto sphere. However, the influencer argues that the initial attraction toward giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum would eventually pivot. Investors, after their primary foray, would likely explore alternative digital assets. These alternatives, which the host referred to as &#8220;pseudo-centralized currencies&#8221; offering distinct use cases, especially those with tracking capabilities, would then become the focal point. Hedera, with its tracking features, according to the host, could potentially emerge as a leading contender in this narrative. Hedera Offerings And Market Dynamics Diving deeper into Hedera&#8217;s offerings, the Classy Crypto host highlighted the consensus service of the platform. The host emphasized that this plays a significant role in tracking and catering to rising global demand. Additionally, in the backdrop of an evolving global political scenario, solutions like Hedera&#8217;s are anticipated to gain traction, given their ability to address large-scale issues. The host noted: Hedera has a consensus that does a lot of tracking and it&#8217;s great for the environment which is an increasingly large issue in our world political scene. Furthermore, beyond these specifics, the influencer also shared a broader market perspective. He envisions a major market breakout before the culmination of 2023. This momentum is likely to carry forward into 2024, heralding a significant bull run. One pivotal point he made pertained to the Layer 2 blockchains prevalent in the market. A realization among investors that many of these platforms might not support sustainable transaction sizes could direct focus towards Hedera.

Over the past 24 hours, HBAR has traded in the red, down by nearly 5%. The asset currently trades at a price of $0.058, at the time of writing. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView"
