The rebranding saw the popular social media app ditch its recognisable bird logo after two decades and replaced it with “ X” after two decades. The rebranding also saw the social media app change its colour scheme from blue to black.</p><p>As part of the rebranding, Twitter’s URL has also been changed to “x.com.” a domain name linked to Musk’s 1999-founded financial services startup that sold to PayPal is now redirecting to Twitter.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy\">https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy</a> now points to <a href=\"https://t.co/AYBszklpkE\">https://t.co/AYBszklpkE</a>. <br><br>Interim X logo goes live later today.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683171310388535296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>X.com was an early online bank and the company was initially funded by Elon Musk and Greg Kouri, who went on to fund Musk's later ventures: Tesla and SpaceX.</p><p>Musk’s association with the brand name ‘X’ began as early as 1999 when he first established the company. However, it wasn't able to transform into a stand-alone company and later became a part of Paypal. Musk used the letter X in his space firm, SpaceX, as well as featuring as part of several of Tesla’s car model names.  The rebranding of Twitter means the character is finally transforming into a stand-alone brand after three decades.</p><p>Musk <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-announces-he-will-step-down-as-twitter-ceo\">established X Corp in March </a>earlier this year as the parent company of Twitter, making way for Twitter’s rebranding. The rebranding comes as part of Musk’s vision to create a “super app” with multiple functionalities including financial services within the social media platform. In April, Twitter introduced a new feature that allowed users of the app to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-to-launch-crypto-and-stock-trading-in-partnership-with-etoro-reports\">access the crypto market and other financial market services</a> from within the app.</p><p>Musk’s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-buys-twitter-for-44b-crypto-industry-reacts\">tenure as the head of Twitter</a> had been controversial from the start. However, his plans to transform Twitter into a financial platform began long before the takeover. </p><p>In a recent interview, Musk reiterated that the main motive behind rebranding to X was to create an “everything app,” a concept quite popular in China. Chinese social media applications such as WeChat, are not just used for text and video calls, but also have provisions to pay bills, book cabs, book restaurants and other financial activities without leaving the app.</p><p>Musk said if done correctly X could become a popular platform for finance: banking, payments, and data, and over time it would have the potential to become “half of the global financial system.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">X is finally arriving! <br><br>X will be an &quot;everything app&quot; i.e. super app for U.S. (like WeChat of China)<br><br>• Social: network, msgs, video, content<br>• Finance: banking, payments, data<br><br>&quot;Overtime it would be HALF of global financial system&quot; - Elon Musk<a href=\"https://t.co/wWywAdYRZR\">pic.twitter.com/wWywAdYRZR</a></p>&mdash; Brandon Hoffman (@BrandonHoffman_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonHoffman_/status/1680002170073280512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>The rebranding of Twitter, however, didn’t elicit much support from many users of the application who believe <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-rebrand-to-x-elon-musk-everything-app\">ditching the two-decade-long legacy for a new concept is not a good idea</a>.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

Within the first one, it is possible to receive TFS tokens as a rakeback; using the second one, it is possible to increase them thanks to the holding without any risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Both programs have already shown outstanding results. Since its launch, $726,234 and $1,759 091,86 were paid to players in frames of the Play To Earn and Hold To Earn respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>TFS Token team is pleased to announce another beneficial way to get additional income for TFS holders - the liquidity staking program.</p>What is liquidity staking?<p>Tokens and money, staked in such a program, will be used to increase liquidity on the PancakeSwap in the TFS-USDT pool. This will help improve the liquidity of the TFS token, thus strengthening its position on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The Liquidity Staking option is available on the Staking Programs page on the Fairspin website.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the already existing staking programs, liquidity staking is permanent, which means if a user chooses this option, staking will continue until the option is not stopped by the user.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the reward from the liquidity staking can be withdrawn at any time upon the user's request. There is no obligatory minimum staking time to withdraw the reward as well as there are no limits on the number of withdrawing requests.&nbsp;</p>How the reward is calculated<p>The amount of reward depends on the GGR of Fairspin casino and the number of tokens in the staking pool and the user's multiplier.</p><p>The user's multiplier depends on the length of your stake in days.</p><p>Calculation formula:</p><ul><li>from 0 to 1 day multiplier *0.3</li><li>from 7 to 30 days multiplier *0.6</li><li>30 to &infin; days multiplier *1</li></ul><p>The reward, in the end, will be equal to % of the GGR of the Fairspin casino multiplied by the user's share in the pool and multiplied by the time multiplier. If a user stakes tokens for 1 month and more, he will have the maximum benefit - a share of 0.5% of GGR.</p><p>The request to stop liquidity staking can be made at any time. A user can request to withdraw the full sum or a part of it.&nbsp;The tokens will be sent to a user&rsquo;s account immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>In case a user makes a request to withdraw a part of tokens from the Liquidity Staking, the reward multiplier for the rest of the tokens in Liquidity Staking will go back to the initial level.</p>About TFS Token&nbsp;<p>The TFS token is the driving force behind Fairspin, one of the leading global blockchain casinos, that ushers in a new era of trust and transparency in online gambling.</p><p>Built upon ERC-20/BEP-20 technology, the TFS token ensures immutable betting data, empowering players with complete access to their gaming history and rewards. With a limited supply and a focus on user rewards, the token introduces groundbreaking Play to Earn and Hold to Earn features, rewarding players for their engagement.</p><p>As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the TFS token stands at the forefront, revolutionizing the way players interact with online casinos and shaping the future of fair gaming.&nbsp;</p>ContactTFS Token PR teampr@fairspin.io"

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/its-over-1000-x-token-surges-following-musks-twitter-rebrand",
    "description": "<p>An obscure altcoin called the X token has surged by over 1000% following Elon Musk&rsquo;s announcement that Twitter is rebranding itself to X.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, the token in question has absolutely no association with the rebranded Twitter or X.com, as it is now known.&nbsp;</p>\nAn Unprecedented Surge&nbsp;\n<p>The X token is linked to an NFT marketplace that announced its closure back in May and registered a staggering increase following Elon Musk&rsquo;s announcement to rebrand Twitter to X.com. The token, which was trading at $0.00002, jumped to $0.00025. According to data from CoinGecko, the token&rsquo;s value has jumped by over 1000% over the past 12 hours. Most of the token&rsquo;s trading volume is on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX). However, despite the massive surge, the token&rsquo;s trading volume remains low, amounting to just $51,000.&nbsp;</p>\nIs There An Association With Twitter?\n<p>The surge occurred after Elon Musk announced an upcoming logo change for the social media platform. Following the announcement, users likely thought the token was related to the rebranded platform. However, the token was part of a project started by X, a decentralized NFT marketplace operating across several chains, and has no association with the rebranded Twitter. The X DAO is in charge of the platform&rsquo;s governance, and users who have staked their X tokens can exercise their voting rights after obtaining the veX governance tokens.&nbsp;</p>\nTwitter&rsquo;s Rebranding&nbsp;\n<p>Elon Musk had announced his plans to rebrand Twitter on Sunday, stating that he intended to retire the iconic blue bird logo that had been part of Twitter&rsquo;s global identity since its inception. In a tweet, he stated that if a good enough X logo is posted, it could go live within 24 hours. Following the tweet, X.com began redirecting to Twitter.com, with Musk tweeting about the company&rsquo;s rebrand to X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds. If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we&rsquo;ll make it go live worldwide tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Musk had also sent an email to Twitter employees telling them about the change to X. He added that this would be the last time he would be using an email address associated with Twitter. While some users, specifically Musk fans, applauded the changes, long-time users of Twitter are miffed with the changes. Marques Brownlee, one of the most well-known names in tech, tweeted that he was still going to call the platform Twitter. Musk responded to the tweet, stating, &ldquo;Not for long.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The platform&rsquo;s rebrand is the clearest indication yet that Twitter is no longer the same social media platform purchased by Musk. Recently appointed chief executive officer of X Corp, which owns Twitter, stated,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square. X is the future state of unlimited interactivity &ndash; centered in audio, video, messaging, and payments/banking &ndash; creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&rsquo;re just beginning to imagine.&rdquo;</p>\n\nMarkets In Recovery?&nbsp;\n<p>Apart from the X token surge, crypto markets remained dormant, with no major movements. The total market capitalization still stands at $1.23 trillion and has remained at that level for the past few days. Bitcoin prices had jumped over the $30,000 mark but have since fallen back, with BTC currently trading at $29,787. Most cryptocurrencies are firmly rooted in the red, with only a few exceptions.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
