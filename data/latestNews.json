As a result, many of the tokens mentioned in the lawsuit were delisted by major trading platforms which made their price tank. </p><p>According to Held, Tokens that “had fair or transparent launches”, such as Litecoin, Dogecoin and Monero, do not match the definition of a security that the SEC is following and therefore are likely to avoid the current crackdown. </p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-charges-binance-coinbase-terrible-defi\">SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase are terrible for DeFi</a></strong></em></p><p>“It definitely seems like the SEC has carved that out as something that they won't be going after”, he said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. </p><p>According to Held, the vast majority of the tokens classified as securities by the SEC in its lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance were proof-of-stake coins, or tokens who had a pre-mined distribution, which means they have a more centralized ownership.</p><p>As Held also pointed out, the current crackdown is mainly carried out by a single government entity, the SEC, which means the level of pressure on the industry is still far from reaching the maximum level. </p><p>Held also stated that only Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies that are decentralized enough will survive in the long run, as they are the only ones that can survive an all-out government attack.</p><p>To find out more about which cryptos can resist the ongoing SEC crackdown, watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DD8I2P53iMM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">full video </a>on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe! </p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
