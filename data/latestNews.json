There could be up to 15 retail and 9 wholesale CBDCs in circulation by 2030. </p><p>These numbers appear in the survey <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a> by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), published on July 10. The survey of 86 central banks was conducted in late 2022 — from October to December. It asked central banks whether they were working on a retail, wholesale, or both types of CBDC, how advanced the work was and what was their motivation for it. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/27c54833-755a-49e8-b85c-11c51af05e27.png\"  /></figure><p>According to a survey, more than half of the world’s CBs are conducting experiments or working on a CBDC pilot. Almost a quarter of all CBs are already piloting their retail CBDC projects. The number of wholesale CBDCs in the works is much lower, at half that amount.</p><p>Geoeconomically, it is the nations within emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE), which are leading the CBDC adoption. Their share in piloting the retail (29%) and wholesale (16%) CBDCs almost doubles that of the advanced economies (AE), which stands at 18% and 10% respectively. </p><p>Both developing and advanced economies mostly share the motivation behind their CBDC projects — financial stability and cross-border payments efficiency. However, there is also a difference, as EMDEs are more often driven by financial inclusion reasons. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bis-develops-framework-against-cbdc-cyberattacks\"><strong><em>BIS develops framework against CBDC cyberattacks</em></strong></a></p><p>The share of CBs that are likely to issue a retail CBDC within the next three years grew from 15% last year to 18%. At the same time, 68% of central banks still state their unreadiness to issue a retail CBDC “any time soon.” </p><p>To date, there are still only 4 CBDCs in circulation — in The Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean, Jamaica and Nigeria. Yet, based on the central bankers' answers, the survey predicts 15 retail and 9 wholesale CBDCs live by the end of this decade. </p><p>At the end of June, the Reserve Bank of India reported <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-central-bank-negotiates-cross-border-cbdc-payments-with-digital-rupee\">ongoing negotiations</a> with at least 18 central banks worldwide regarding the possibility of cross-border payments via its CBDC, the “digital rupee.” In July, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Innovation Center (NYIC) completed its proof-of-concept of a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ny-fed-banks-wrap-up-regulated-liabilities-network-proof-of-concept-using-wcbdc\">regulated liability network for a CBDC</a>. </p><p><strong><em><u>Magazine: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/tornado-cash-2-0-the-race-to-build-safe-and-legal-coin-mixers/\"><strong><em>The race to build safe and legal coin mixers</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
