Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Boiron's appointment comes more than a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argued that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/impossible-to-know-what-is-a-security-mark-cuban-on-sec\">MATIC is a \"security\"</a> in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. </p><p>Meanwhile, the price gains also appear as Polygon prepares to implement a sequence of network upgrades as a part of its \"<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-proposes-architecture-for-polygon-2-0-including-aggregator-bridge\">Polygon 2.0</a>\" overhaul. Namely, the establishment of a \"decentralized governance\" protocol by July 17.</p><h2>MATIC whales get bigger</h2><p>MATIC's price rally on July 11 succeeds a period of strong whale accumulation.</p><p>For instance, the supply of MATIC held by entities with balance between 10 million and 100 million tokens has increased by more than 1% in July so far.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/0bd99590-b320-42eb-a57c-193efa800cb3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Whale supply distribution. Source: Santiment</em></figcaption></figure><p>That coincides with a drop in the supply held by the 1 million-10 million MATIC cohort. In other words, some whales from the 1 million-10 million MATIC cohort accumulated tokens in July and became part of the 10 million-100 million MATIC cohort.</p><h2>MATIC's July outlook</h2><p>From a technical perspective, MATIC looks prepared to undergo sharp price declines in July.</p><p>As of July 11, the Polygon token was testing a resistance confluence comprising its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), a support-turned-resistance horizontal trendline, and an ascending trendline constituting a potential <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-trade-bull-and-bear-flag-patterns\">bear flag pattern</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/b5e746ab-bfc6-448a-917e-e8fec4f30bac.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>A pullback from the resistance confluence risks sending the price toward the flag's lower trendline near $0.68 in July, down about 10% from current price levels. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-2-0-introduces-upgrades-to-tap-into-value-layer-of-internet\">Polygon 2.0 introduces upgrades to tap into ‘Value Layer’ of internet</a></em></strong></p><p>Moreover, a close below the lower trendline will increase the potential of triggering a bear flag breakdown scenario. This means a downside target of around $0.50 in July, down nearly 30% from current price levels.</p><p>On the other hand, a decisive close above the flag's upper trendline could weaken MATIC's bearish prospects, enabling an extended run-up toward the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $0.90. In other words, a 20% rally by July.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
