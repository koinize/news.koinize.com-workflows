The continuous rejection from the $100 level has persisted over the past 15 days. However, this should not be of extreme concern, considering that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has been unable to sustain levels above $1.6 trillion throughout 2024. Despite the recent setback, SOL recorded an impressive 84% gain in December, causing investors to express concerns about the lack of positive price momentum.</p><p>The FOMO (fear of missing out) driving SOL's rally in December 2023 was triggered by the pump of Solana SPL token airdrops, which included Jito (JTO), BONK, and Dogwifhat (WIF). This movement stimulated demand for the Solana Saga Phone, as some projects targeted exclusive offers for these users. However, the tide appears to have turned, as BONK faced a 15% correction between Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, while JTO declined by 19% in the same period.</p><p>Another factor contributing to SOL's recent correction was the excessive optimism caused by airdrop expectations. Some launches took longer than anticipated, while others provided only a temporary short-term boost to its decentralized applications (DApps), fading after the respective airdrop snapshots. Analysts and influencers created lists of the most promising opportunities, but almost none of the tokens reached decent valuations and volumes.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-why-solana-sol-price-is-down-this-week\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Rekt Capital, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast, has revealed the potential directions that the price of Bitcoin could take in light of the upcoming fourth BTC Halving. Potential Retracement For Bitcoin With the halving event approaching, analysts are debating what steps Bitcoin should take after its recent breach from the macro downtrend. One of those is Rekt Capital, who has weighed in on the particular issue and made a comparison to past trends. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Bitcoin Price Set To Plunge Even Lower The crypto analyst shared his latest projections during one of his YouTube predictions videos for Bitcoin. In the video, Rekt Capital delves in on the &#8220;next possible steps&#8221; that BTC is anticipated to take while highlighting &#8220;a breakout from its macro downtrend.&#8221; His analysis focuses mainly on the reaccumulation range that formed prior to the halving event in 2015-1016 period. He further drew a comparison between 2023-2024 and 2015-2016, while noting similarities between the two periods. According to him, the trend that formed within that period has resurfaced in the current 2023-2024 period. &#8220;One of the things that contributes to that similarity is the reaccumulation that formed a few months before the halving,&#8221; he stated. Rekt Capital pointed out the possibility of a retracement around the Bitcoin halving event. This is due to a scenario proposed by the crypto analyst in which a reaccumulation range break triggers a retreat. An analogy to the cycle of 2015–2016 indicates a comparable rejection from a resistance level prior to the halving, which may have contributed to a possible retreat. Furthermore, he has highlighted that such retracements are indicated by historical data but stresses that they are often brief. However, he asserted that after the retrace, which is the &#8220;last opportunity,&#8221; we would see a price increase for Bitcoin. This surge will &#8220;turn the $46,000 price level into a new support level, and move to touch its old all-time high.&#8221; Rekt Capital also anticipates the price going beyond this level putting Bitcoin on a path to a new all-time high. Factors The Buttress BTC Value, ETFs Not Included Samson Mow, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pixelmatic, has revealed several factors that boost Bitcoin&#8217;s value. Mow took to X (formerly Twitter) to underscore these factors with the crypto community. According to him, the value of Bitcoin is amplified by &#8220;scarcity, utility, and the failure of fiat.&#8221; Mow further insisted that BTC Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) do not contribute to the token&#8217;s value. His X post came in response to CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Mad Money&#8221; host Jim Cramer&#8217;s post over his comments on BTC&#8217;s current action. Cramer asserted that &#8220;no one showed up&#8221; after the approval of BTC ETFs, which led to a decline in price. Related Reading: Jim Cramer Says Bitcoin Is Topping Off, Time To Buy Bitcoin?

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-analyst-xrp-crash-0-34/",
    "description": "XRP holders may have to deal with more price declines from the crypto token if this crypto analyst’s recent analysis is anything to go by. This bearish analysis comes amidst several other predictions that have painted bullish narratives for the crypto token.  XRP Could Drop To As Low As $0.34 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted how a possible XRP sell-off could trigger a price decline to $0.34. As part of his analysis, he stated that XRP was currently “grappling” to maintain its footing at the crucial $0.55 support level. The token’s failure to hold that level will be what leads to the sell-off scenario.  Source: X From the accompanying chart that Martinez shared, it was indeed evident that XRP was struggling to hold above the $0.55 level. A potential drop to $0.34 will see the crypto token drop to a price level that it hasn’t come close to since around April 2023. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also noted how critical the $0.55 level was, labeling it as a “significant support for XRP.” Related Reading: Trillion-Dollar Franklin Templeton Shares High Praise For Solana, Is A SOL ETF Coming? However, he had shown optimism that any price drop wasn’t going to be as bad as Martinez suggested by stating that he didn’t see the weekly candle closing below the $0.50 level. In fact, instead of anticipating any price decline, the analyst remarked that he was choosing to focus on the bigger picture. What The Bigger Picture Is According to Egrag Crypto, XRP is going to rise to $5 in less than 90 days from now. The analyst still alluded to this prediction in a more recent X post. While laying out three possible scenarios for XRP’s price, he stated that the market makers may “engineer an independent surge” that could propel XRP to this price level.  Related Reading: Injective On A Roll: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Breakout Against Bitcoin Egrag had also previously mentioned that the altcoin could rise to as high as $27. He believes this price level is attainable based on the fact that XRP, back in 2017, surged by 61,000% in 280 days. This was something he emphasized once again in his latest post, noting that a 50% drop remains a “plausible scenario” as XRP tries to replicate that percentage move from 2017.  While a significant price drop remains a huge possibility, Egrag believes that it also represents a “generational buying opportunity.” The analyst has continued to urge XRP holders to remain patient, especially if they hope to make the most gains from their XRP holdings, with Egrag once analyzing how the token will rise to $2,500 by 2029.  In the meantime, those invested in the token will hope that Martinez’ prediction doesn’t come true, seeing that XRP has already dropped below $0.55. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.54, down by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
