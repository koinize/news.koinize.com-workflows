He was convicted of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of securities fraud, one count of commodities fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering conspiracy. He will return to court for sentencing by New York District Judge Lewis Kaplan on March 28, 2024. Government prosecutors <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/whats-next-sam-bankman-fried-prison-ftx-criminal-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >will recommend a sentence</a>, but Judge Kaplan will have the final say. Bankman-Frieds crimes each carry a maximum sentence of between five and 20 years in prison with the wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy carrying a maximum 20-year sentence. His lawyers, however, say the fight isnt over yet.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-paypal-faces-sec-action-related-to-pyusd-stablecoin-official\"><strong>PayPal faces SEC action related to PYUSD stablecoin: Official</strong></h2><p>Payment giant PayPal <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-subpoena-sec-pyusd-stablecoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >has received a subpoena</a> from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.
