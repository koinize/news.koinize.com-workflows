ADA price is moving lower below the $0.292 support against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.290 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.2815 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could decline heavily if the bulls fail to protect the $0.2765 support zone. Cardano’s ADA Price Faces Uphill Task This past week, Cardano’s price attempted a fresh increase above the $0.285 zone. The price climbed above the $0.295 resistance zone but the bears were active near the $0.30 zone. A high was formed near $0.3015 before there was a fresh decline. The price declined below the $0.285 level and tested the $0.2765 support. It is now consolidating losses below $0.292, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a minor recovery wave above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3013 swing high to the $0.2754 low. However, the bears were active above the $0.290 level. ADA is now trading below $0.290 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.2815 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair.

The next key resistance might be $0.30. If there is a close above the $0.30 resistance, the price could start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.320 resistance zone. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.292 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.2815 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2765 level. A downside break below the $0.2765 level could open the doors for a sharp fresh decline toward $0.255. The next major support is near the $0.232 level.
