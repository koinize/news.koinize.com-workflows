To achieve a broader audience, Web3 gaming needs a wow moment to go viral and into the records of gaming history.</p><p>Web3 gaming studios are falling into the same trap that many of their traditional predecessors fell into: Better visuals, more rewards and a larger cast of characters. Sure, these are some vital elements of the gaming experience, but in order to expand a whole ecosystem, developers need to think beyond that.</p><p>With Street Fighter 6 just released and Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, its safe to say that the fighting games are having a big comeback. But lets remember the exact moment that showed players worldwide the joy of fighting games for the first time: The EVO Moment 37.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Official Evo Moment #37, Daigo vs Justin Evo 2004 in HD\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzS96auqau0?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://cointelegraph.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></figure><p>In 2004, during the golden years of home consoles, the fighting game-focused tournament EVO saw a magical moment where two legendary players competed with each other and one of them  Daigo Umehara  pulled a move that was then considered impossible. YouTube was not a thing back then, so that moment was captured by the official DVD that was released the following year. It was named Evo Moment 37 and became a major trigger for wide audiences to take fighting games seriously.</p><p>Web3 gaming needs that. Web3 studios need to add inspiration, wow moment potential and an aspect of virality to their products. It will be a tough road to gain the interest of mainstream audiences until then.</p><h2>Om Nom enters the metaverse</h2><p>Games like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, and Cut the Rope assumed the role of catalyzers during the dawn of mobile gaming: They catapulted smartphones and tablets to the hands of a mainstream audience with vivid visuals, cute characters and intuitive gameplays that used then-groundbreaking frictionless touch screen in innovative ways.

According to the regulator, such a CBDC design would increase the security of funds as CBDC holdings limits could safeguard users from cyberattacks targeting their balances or transactions.</p><p>Setting limits on retail CBDC holdings could also allow regulators to deal with the tradeoff between privacy and transparency by offering diverse tiers of limits.</p><p>For example, the Colombian central bank could offer digital wallets with small holding limits and a high level of privacy for people that place a high valuation to their transaction data. On the other hand, those who are comfortable with disclosing more data could prefer high holding limits and lower levels of privacy.</p><p>Additionally, CBDC limits could be beneficial for commercial banks as they would reduce the demand for a retail CBDC as a store of value in competition with bank accounts, the central bank noted.</p><p>“The introduction of the CBDC could be an attractive alternative for some risk-averse holders of other cash-like instruments,” the study reads, adding that this could impact the demand for government bonds, commercial papers and term deposit certificates. The study authors stated:</p><blockquote>“By imposing CBDC holding limits to end users, this, and other types of situations — the tradeoff between privacy and security — could be easily controlled.”</blockquote><p>While closely monitoring and studying the global development of CBDC, the Colombian central bank is still uncertain about whether its nation needs such a digital currency.</p><p>“The decision of issuing a retail CBDC must consider the fact that it would also need to have enough desirable features to generate a core group of users sufficient to generate the network externalities needed to make it viable,” the study authors stated.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/canadians-little-reason-to-adopt-cbdc-central-bank-paper\"><strong><em>Canadians have ‘weak incentives’ to use a CBDC: Bank of Canada</em></strong></a></p><p>A number of other global jurisdictions and organizations have considered setting limits on CBDC holding and spending as well.</p><p>In July, major United Kingdom’s finance trade bodies like UK Finance argued that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/united-kingdom-digital-pound-privacy-concerns\">government should limit users’ digital pound holdings</a> between 3,000 British pounds ($3,800) and 5,000 pounds ($6,400). According to UK Finance, a higher limit on Britcoin holdings — such as 20,000 pounds ($25,600) per individual — could destabilize the traditional banking system by facilitating bank runs or deposit competition with banks.</p><p>In 2020, European Central Bank’s director general of market infrastructure and payments, Ulrich Bindseil, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2351~c8c18bbd60.en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> the adoption of a digital euro holding limit of 3,000 euros ($3,271) per person.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinas-risky-bitcoin-court-decision-is-huobi-in-trouble-or-not-asia-express/\"><strong><em>Asia Express: China’s risky Bitcoin court decision, is Huobi in trouble or not? </em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

PYUSD is reportedly fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasurys and similar cash equivalents.</p><p>PayPal said that the launch showcases the company’s focus on becoming a crypto payment giant and aims to make the stablecoin a key part of its payment infrastructure. PYUSD is currently being rolled out for selected customers in the United States.</p><p>The payment technology firm first confirmed its plan to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-stablecoin-what-it-could-mean-for-payments\">launch a stablecoin in January 2022</a>, nearly two years after it had made way for users in the U.S. and the United Kingdom to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies in their PayPal accounts.</p><p>PYUSD will be primarily used for remittances as well as a mode of payment for millions of PayPal merchants. The firm noted that the new stablecoin will be made available on Venmo in the near future, where users will be able to transfer it between the two platforms. The stablecoin will also be transferable with wallets that support PYUSD, such as Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask.</p><h2>Another stablecoin enters the market</h2><p>The crypto stablecoin market cap is $125 billion at the moment, primarily dominated by two players — Tether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index\">USDT</a>) with a $86.5-billion market capitalization followed by Circle-issued USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index\">USDC</a>) with a $26-billion market cap. The rest of the market share is taken up by the likes of Binance-supported stablecoins such as Binance USD (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-usd-busd-price-index\">BUSD</a>), TruUSD (TUSD) and a few others. While there are several stablecoins players in the market, PayPal’s stablecoin will be the first issued by a major payment processor. </p><p>The launch of PYUSD was welcomed by most of the current stablecoin market leaders, including Tether chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino, who told Cointelegraph that the new PayPal stablecoin will lead to healthy competition and offer users a wider choice, adding:</p><blockquote>“We all have the shared goal of driving stablecoin adoption and innovation, and competition leads to the development of solutions that enhance the overall ecosystem. Each project strives to differentiate itself by providing unique benefits to users, driving innovation and providing users with more choices and control over their transactions. Fostering competition allows a healthy and diverse market environment.”</blockquote><h2>Centralization and “freeze” function controversy</h2><p>Stablecoins were initially created in the crypto market as an on-ramp method allowing users to get access to a wide range of crypto assets. However, the role of stablecoins has since expanded, with many of them now acting as key liquidity providers for exchanges as well as hedge assets during tumultuous market conditions. </p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-the-u-s-to-japan-regulators-are-beginning-to-embrace-crypto\">From the U.S. to Japan, regulators are beginning to embrace crypto</a></em></strong></p><p>The PYUSD launch was widely celebrated as a net positive for the crypto industry but came with its fair share of controversy.</p><p>Crypto Twitter was quick to critize the <a href=\"https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">centralized structure</a> of PYUSD, which — among other things — allows the owner to to pause transfers and freeze addresses and also allows admins to increase the stablecoin’s total supply.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So the PayPal stablecoin contract:<br>- Is written in an extremely old version of Solidity<br>- Allows the owner to pause all transfers<br>- Allows the owner to freeze addresses to prevent actions<br>- Allows admins to increase the total supply at will<br><br>Centralized, but transparent at least. <a href=\"https://t.co/VJ3Jgj1SJ3\">pic.twitter.com/VJ3Jgj1SJ3</a></p>&mdash; cygaar (@0xCygaar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1688592430315036672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 7, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Although the code repository became a hot topic on social media platforms, many other market-leading stablecoins, be they Tether or USD Coin, all have similar features encoded in their system. These very same controversial features have often been used by other stablecoin issuers to freeze the funds of scammers and hackers. </p><p>Kene Ezeji-Okoye, co-founder of digital infrastructure firm Millicent Labs, told Cointelegraph that such centralized features are required for any stablecoin to be regulated. He noted that PYUSD is issued by Paxos, which holds New York state’s difficult-to-obtain BitLicense and has issued its own stablecoin. He said:</p><blockquote>“The beauty of crypto is that anyone can choose which type of assets they want to use, but given that 94% of all stablecoins are centralized, the market has given its view as to the model most people think is safest.”</blockquote><p>Michael Quintanilla, director of Web3 and blockchain software firm SoftServ, believes that PayPal’s ability to modify PYUSD balances is critical for regulatory and operational purposes. </p><p>He told Cointelegraph that there are various instances where these aspects come in handy: “For instance, should an account engage in illicit activities, PayPal may need to legally adjust or freeze its funds. Similarly, unusual transactions, like unexpected large transfers, can be halted or reversed to prevent potential fraud. Operational errors leading to incorrect PYUSD distributions can also be rectified to uphold trust and the coin’s stability.”</p><h2>Legal uncertainty for stablecoins in the U.S.</h2><p>PayPal entering the stablecoin market also raises hopes for clearer regulations for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. — many in the crypto industry have claimed that current regulations are outdated and unclear, making doing business difficult.</p><p>PayPal has stated that one of its key ares of focus will be to work closely with regulators.</p><p>With the growing popularity and expanding market cap, stablecoins have also become a key topic of discussion among policymakers in the United States. Over the past year, stablecoin issuers have faced significant regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., especially USDC issuer Circle, whose CEO <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-ceo-blames-us-crypto-crackdown-for-declining-usdc-market-cap\">blamed unwarranted regulatory pressure</a> for their declining market cap.</p><p>USDC was seen as a key rival to USDT with a market cap of $56 billion at its peak. However, since the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-crisis-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\">banking crisis</a> and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-depegs-as-circle-confirms-3-3b-stuck-with-silicon-valley-bank\">USDC’s depeg</a>, the stablecoin’s market cap has been cut nearly in half, currently sitting just above $26 billion. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/ba63b362-a39a-4084-86f9-611732fbaa4a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">One-year USDC market capitalization chart shows value dropping sharply with onset of  banking crisis. Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure><p>U.S. lawmakers are currently working on a bipartisan stablecoin bill that proposes to make the Federal Reserve the key regulator tasked with formulating requirements for issuing stablecoins while granting state regulators powers to oversee the companies issuing the tokens. The stablecoin bill called the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/payment-stablecoins-keep-your-coins-act-pass-house-committee\">passed by the Financial House Committee in July</a>. </p><p>At a time when stablecoin issuers are facing regulatory heat, with the Securities and Exchange Commission going after the likes of BUSD and banning its issuance by Paxos, experts believe PayPal could turn the tide.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/banning-ransomware-payments-attractive-dangerous-idea/\">Should we ban ransomware payments? It’s an attractive but dangerous idea</a></em></strong></p><p>Elitsa Taskova, chief product officer at crypto lending platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph that PayPal isn’t known for taking huge risks, which contrasts with Silicon Valley’s “move fast and break things” ethos.</p><p>“Crypto companies might see value in hitching themselves to PayPal and integrating PYUSD into their platforms, reasoning that PayPal is unlikely to cut corners in terms of compliance or rush its product to market,” she said, adding:</p><blockquote>“Considering PayPal’s solid track record of scaling a successful and innovative business, their foray into the stablecoin market is likely to bring a wave of adoption for crypto and, specifically, stablecoins while also consolidating market share from the existing stablecoin leaders.”</blockquote><p>Injective Labs CEO Eric Chen told Cointelegraph that PYUSD has the potential to attract a new set of both semi-crypto and non-crypto companies, stating that it could “resonate with a new segment of companies looking for a stablecoin solution that aligns with evolving regulations and offers a fresh perspective.”</p><p>The launch of the new stablecoin is being seen as the testimony to mainstream financial giants’ growing interest in the crypto ecosystem. PayPal, with over 400 million customers worldwide, could accelerate the stablecoin use and push for blockchain technology-based payment solutions in traditional finance.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-stablecoin-crypto-adoption&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "Within the dynamic cryptocurrency environment, THORChain (RUNE) has emerged as a notable altcoin, capturing the interest of investors who are actively pursuing methods to augment the diversification of their investment portfolios. In conjunction with the established entities such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the cryptocurrency market has experienced significant growth with a diverse range of alternative coins, each presenting unique attributes and prospective prospects. Related Reading: Cardano Holder Resilience Tested As ADA Fends Off Bearish Onslaught Altcoins, which comprise a diverse array of technological advancements, application cases, and governance frameworks, provide investors a wide range of options to consider. THORChain Emits Force In The Weekly Chart THORChain (RUNE), renowned for its cross-chain liquidity mechanism, has garnered significant attention this week due to a different factor. RUNE price action today. Source: Coingecko According to statistics from Coingecko, THORChain is currently priced at $1.54, reflecting an increase of 50% over the past seven days. However, it has had a decline of 3.7% within the last 24 hours. The boost in price can be attributed to a concurrent rise in the social volume of the THORChain cryptocurrency. According to data from Coincodex, there was a significant increase in social volume, exceeding 4,300%, during the period from August 7 to 13. The price of RUNE has exhibited a bullish trend since the middle of June. However, this upward movement was interrupted when the price above the $1 threshold and subsequently began to undergo a retracement. The price of the cryptocurrency established a support level at $0.92 following a significant decline, then initiating a bullish recovery to surpass the prominent psychological threshold of $1. RUNE reaches $527 million in market cap today. Chart: TradingView.com In the preceding month, the cryptocurrency had a notable increase of 30%, while also exhibiting a 5% rise since the commencement of the year 2023. Nevertheless, the performance of the subject over an extended period of time presents a more pessimistic portrayal. Over the course of the previous four quarters, there was a significant decline of around 50% in the value of the coin, suggesting the presence of inherent instability. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant decline of 94% from its peak value of $20.87 in May 2021, highlighting the fundamental instability of the cryptocurrency market. RUNE Faces Resistance At $1.55 Although there have been recent positive developments that may be encouraging for investors with short-term goals, the overall trend indicates that there have been challenges over longer time periods. The significant declines observed in the past year, as well as from the highest point, underscore the precarious nature of cryptocurrency investments. This necessitates a careful evaluation of their long-term viability within a dynamic market environment. RUNE price action in the last seven days.

This particular domain holds significant importance as it has alternately functioned as both a point of opposition and reinforcement from the onset of the year 2021. Hence, the act of closing above it will serve as a significant indication of a positive trend, thereby reinforcing the bullish readings observed on the daily timescale. As the liquidity mechanism for THORChain may develop over the next few months, cryptocurrency experts anticipate even further price hikes for the platform. Additionally, 14 new nodes are prepared to join the THORChain network, according to CoinCodex. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

    "description": "The price of Bitcoin is finally on the move after weeks of being stuck in a tight trading range. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap stands at support with the potential for another re-test of the lows if bulls cannot push it higher. Related Reading: Polygon: New Partnership With Korean Telecom Giant Fails To Halt MATIC Slide As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,500 with a 2% loss in the past 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 3% loss, while other assets in the top 10 underperformed and trended lower. The nascent industry could be a short-term crossroads. Bitcoin Price Loses $29,000 Level, But A Recovery Is Likely? As NewsBTC has been reporting, Bitcoin’s volatility reached a multi-year low after all major narratives previously influencing it diminished its strength. Now, the spike in volatility favored the downside, but how much pressure can the bears exercise? According to a CryptoQuant analyst, the recent price action marks one of the highest in recent months. As seen in the chart below, the last time that Bitcoin saw similar selling pressure was in late July. The analyst stated: This marks the strongest surge in selling since July 15th. It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to witness the pinnacle of selling pressure at this very moment. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin bounced back from support each time that sellers pushed into the current levels, as measured by the Net Taker Volume. However, sellers could still push the metric into the July 15th levels and induce a capitulation event. There is some evidence to support the above. The chart below shows that BTC&#8217;s long positions have fueled the downside price action by providing liquidity and accelerating the fall. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Takes a Bit Hit: Main Reasons $1,720 or $1,650 Are Likely Targets If this continues, Bitcoin could continue trending downwards into the liquidity pool created by long positions at $27,000 and $24,700 if bulls give it. On the latter, crypto analytics firm Material Indicators noted: Bitcoin price and liquidity continuing to erode and a critical test of support is eminent. IMO&#8230; Losing $29k would be purely psychological. Losing $28.5k would be technical. Holding $28.3k is critical. Losing the buy wall at $27.9k would cause a cascade.
