    "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, Circle, a prominent player in the stablecoin market, strategically leverages its substantial cash reserves of over $1 billion to weather fresh competition from non-crypto giants like PayPal.  The company&#8217;s market share of the second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), has been declining, mainly due to factors such as Binance&#8217;s decision to reduce its usage of USDC.  However, per the report, Circle remains optimistic about the future of stablecoins and aims to stem the decline while exploring new revenue streams and global expansion. Circle Relies On $1 Billion Cash Cushion The circulation of Circle&#8217;s USDC has witnessed a significant drop from $45 billion to approximately $26 billion this year, while Tether, the leading stablecoin, has experienced growth during the same period.  Related Reading: Whale Purchases $10 Million stETH In The past Day, Here Are Possible Reasons Why Circle attributes part of this decline to Binance&#8217;s reduced utilization of USDC to promote its native token. Increasing competition from non-crypto companies like PayPal further intensifies the challenges for Circle. The company&#8217;s over $1 billion cash cushion provides a significant hedge against market headwinds. The company generates revenue primarily from interest income on assets backing the USDC, including dollar deposits and short-term Treasuries.  According to Bloomberg, Circle&#8217;s strong financial performance is &#8220;evident,&#8221; with revenues exceeding $779 million in the year&#8217;s first half.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached $219 million in the same period, exceeding the 2022 full-year figure of $150 million. Circle&#8217;s CEO Remains Bullish On Stablecoins  While acknowledging the impact of &#8220;tail-risk events&#8221; on USDC adoption, Circle&#8217;s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, remains optimistic about stablecoins&#8217; mainstream potential. Allaire believes that increasing competition, such as PayPal&#8217;s recent entry into the market, will drive more financial services and internet payment firms to embrace stablecoins.  Circle is actively pursuing partnerships to promote the broader adoption of USDC and plans to enhance transparency by regularly sharing financial reports. Moreover, the company has engaged Deloitte as its auditor. Allaire anticipates that stablecoin issuers will face greater scrutiny and regulatory standards in the coming years. With regulators tightening control over stablecoins globally, he predicts that entities unable to meet these standards will be crowded out of the mainstream market.  Related Reading: PEPE Coin Makes Minor Gains With 3.5% Spike – Sign Of Recovery? Nevertheless, Circle remains confident in its ability to adapt and benefit from the evolving regulatory environment. Despite potential interest rate declines, Circle expects increased crypto activity, positioning the company for further growth. Circle is leveraging its substantial cash reserves to navigate market challenges and competition from non-crypto players. Despite declining market share, Circle remains focused on expanding revenue streams, promoting wider adoption of USDC, and embracing transparent financial reporting.  With the regulatory landscape evolving, Circle aims to meet the highest standards and thrive in the stablecoin market, positioning itself for long-term success. Conversely, USDC currently boasts a market capitalization of approximately $26.17 billion, securing its place as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data.  This figure represents a minute 0.37% of the total cryptocurrency market, indicating the stablecoin&#8217;s steady performance despite the highly dynamic nature of the crypto space. With a circulating supply of 26.17 billion USDC tokens, the stablecoin has established a robust presence in the market. Furthermore, USDC&#8217;s trading volume has surged, reaching an impressive $3.03 billion in the past 24 hours. This substantial trading activity positions USDC as the fourth most actively traded cryptocurrency, evidencing its liquidity and attractiveness to market participants.  The 24-hour trading volume to market cap ratio stands at 11.59%, reflecting the strong liquidity and market depth of USDC, which further contributes to its stability and utility.

    "description": "Bitcoin price is moving lower from the $30,200 zone. BTC is signaling a fresh decline and there is a risk of a drop toward the $28,500 support. Bitcoin is struggling to remain in a positive zone above $29,200. The price is trading below $29,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $29,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $29,200 support zone. Bitcoin Price Trims Gains Bitcoin price faced another rejection above the $30,000 resistance zone. A high was formed near $30,190 and BTC reacted to the downside. There was a move below the $30,000 and $29,800 levels. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $28,628 swing low to the $30,190 high. It seems like the bulls are now putting up some fight near the $29,300 zone.

Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the trend line and $29,500. A close above the trend line could start a decent increase toward $30,000.
