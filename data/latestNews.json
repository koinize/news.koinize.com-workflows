    "description": "Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Jan3, Samson Mow, has pinpointed a range of macroeconomic indicators that could signal an impending rally for Bitcoin. Mow focuses on exchange-traded inflows (ETF), Bitcoin‚Äôs Hashrate, and whale activity on prominent exchanges like Bitfinex. The Jan3 CEO also mentioned the 200-week moving average (WMA) in forecasting Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. The recent data shared by Cypherpunk on X highlighting significant whale accumulation on Bitfinex further supports Mow&#8217;s Bitfinex whale indicator, suggesting an increased interest from large-scale investors in the flagship crypto. This is some great alpha from @Excellion. You can see for yourself that the whales on #Bitfinex are accumulating #Bitcoin. Decide what you want to do with that information. üöÄ https://t.co/IHjrqUvrDn pic.twitter.com/FS518AIYoz ‚Äî CYPHERPUNK (@cypherpunkstore) January 29, 2024 Broader Economic Indicators Mow also looks beyond the crypto-specific data, considering global economic factors like Tether‚Äôs USDT Assets Under Management, government debt payments, and Debt-to-GDP ratios. The Bitcoin advocate believes these factors, along with nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, real inflation rates, and M3 money supply, could profoundly impact Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. These are the #Bitcoin macro indicators I‚Äôm looking at: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ETF inflows ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Hashrate ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Finex whale accumulation ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 200 WMA trend ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Tether USDt AUM ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Govt interest payments on debt ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Debt GDP ratios ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Nation-state Bitcoin adoption ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Real inflation ‚¨ÜÔ∏è M3 money ‚Äî Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 28, 2024 Notably, Samson Mow has remained steadfast in his ambitious prediction for BTC, maintaining a $1 million price target for the crypto. Mow recently cautioned about the potential &#8216;max pain&#8216; accompanying a rapid ascent of Bitcoin to this monumental valuation. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says February Will Be A Bullish Month For Bitcoin, Here‚Äôs Why Furthermore, Mow has recently suggested that this significant price milestone could materialize relatively quickly, possibly within days or weeks. However, according to the Jan3 CEO, the starting point for this potential surge is &#8220;TBD&#8221; (to be disclosed). My main prediction is the run up to $1M happens in days to weeks. Starting point TBD. ‚Äî Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 14, 2024 Bitcoin Latest Trajectory And Prediction Despite a recent dip below $39,000 last week, BTC has shown a slight increase, with an uptick bringing its price above $42,000. This recovery, though slight, aligns with the optimistic predictions of various analysts and experts, including Samson Mow. SkyBridge Capital&#8217;s founder, Anthony Scaramucci, has also joined the chorus with an optimistic prediction for Bitcoin. Scaramucci‚Äôs analysis suggests a potential 300% increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs value post-halving, with a long-term price target of $400,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $45,000 Amid Anticipation Of FOMC Decision His estimates, based on historical data and market trends, indicate that the peak bullish period for BTC could be about 18 months after the halving event. These predictions are further supported by the recent developments in Bitcoin ETFs, including the filing of the first-ever Bitcoin spot ETF in Hong Kong, indicating a growing institutional interest in BTC.
