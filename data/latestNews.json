    "description": "As Bitcoin teases the psychological barrier of $30,000, enthusiasts and analysts appear to be closely watching every price movement. The general sentiment so far seems to be not a question of &#8216;if&#8217; but &#8216;when&#8217; BTC will make its way past this significant mark. Glassnode founder, aptly named &#8220;Negentropic&#8221;, recently shed some light on Bitcoin&#8217;s current price action via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). The analyst observed that the top cryptocurrency remains comfortably perched above the 100-hourly SMA, consistently maintaining its price above the $28,000 range. Related Reading: Binance Traders Go Bearish On Bitcoin, But Here’s Why They Might Regret It Bitcoin Potential Upward Trajectory Diving deeper into the specifics, Negentropic pinpointed an immediate resistance for Bitcoin at $28,550. This is the threshold that the analyst believes could act as a catalyst for further price movements. According to Negentropic, if Bitcoin breaches this resistance and pushes past the $29,500 mark, it&#8217;s almost certain that the top crypto will set its sights on the coveted $30,000 level. Going by the momentum, it&#8217;s not unrealistic to even anticipate a peak of around $30,650, the analyst concluded. Are bulls taking control as they rally around the $28k zone? Main takeaways: • Current price &#62; $28k &#38; above the 100 hourly SMA 📊 • Immediate resistance at $28.55k ⛔ • Break past $29.5k could lead to $30k target 🎯 • Potential to reach beyond $30.65k with continued momentum… pic.twitter.com/Al8q2xGg5V — 𝗡𝗲𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰 (@Negentropic_) October 19, 2023 However, price isn&#8217;t the only metric painting a bullish picture for Bitcoin. In another post on X that sparked considerable interest, on-chain analytics firm Santiment disclosed that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding a minimum of 100 BTC has surged significantly, reaching 15,970. 🐳 #Bitcoin&#8216;s number of wallets holding at least 100 $BTC has jumped to 15,970 after the largest single day jump of 2023 on Saturday. Since this accumulation, $BTC&#8216;s price is +5.3%, and they may not be done. We will continue to monitor. https://t.co/l0drhvkf7E pic.twitter.com/0mDAmys7N4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 18, 2023 His statistic often signifies increased confidence among larger investors, suggesting that the ecosystem&#8217;s key players are anticipating a continued upward trajectory for BTC. BTC Latest Price Action Recently, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has exhibited a bullish trend. Over the past week, the asset has surged by 7.5%. This uptick has propelled BTC to trade above the $28,500 threshold, currently priced at $28,698, marking a 1.2% increase in the last 24 hours. From the analysis provided by Negentropic, BTC seems to have decisively breached its resistance at $28,550. This break could signify an imminent upward rally, based on insights from the Glassnode founder. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000?
