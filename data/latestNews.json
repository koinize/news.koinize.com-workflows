According to La Rose, the region has always been an “important pillar” to EOS as it has a vast amount of tokenholders. He added: </p><blockquote>“We strongly believe that the next wave of Web3 innovation will come in the form of blockchain-based gaming and GameFi. Asia is clearly a leader in that space.”</blockquote><p>The ENF CEO also said that Japan is a growing market with an established regulatory framework and a supportive government. La Rose believes there’s an “incredible opportunity” for countries like Japan to absorb market share, as it offers clarity and oversight. The ENF CEO also noted that many gaming intellectual properties in Japan are “ripe for tokenization.”</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-turns-5-celebrates-the-community-s-effort-to-rebuild\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/eos-turns-5-celebrates-the-community-s-effort-to-rebuild/amp\"><strong><em>EOS turns 5, celebrates the community’s effort to rebuild</em></strong></a></p><p>Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has recently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-web3-japan-to-promote-web3-as-binance-announces-imminent-launch\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-web3-japan-to-promote-web3-as-binance-announces-imminent-launch/amp\">reaffirmed the country’s stance</a> regarding Web3.
