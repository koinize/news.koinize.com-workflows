And District Court Judge Analisa Torres rejected the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to file an interlocutory appeal in the Ripple case.</p><h2>Polygon co-founder steps down, will contribute ‘from the sidelines’</h2><p>Polygon co-founder Jaynti Kanani announced on Oct. 4 that they’ll be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-co-founder-steps-down\">stepping down and contributing from the sidelines</a>. The former Polygon CEO stepped back from chief executive duties in 2021, ceding the way for then chief legal officer Marc Boiron to assume the position. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It was a great ride for sure and I had a whole lot of fun working alongside you. <br><br>New adventures and milestones coming soon!

The general sentiment surrounding the departure appeared to indicate that the community appreciated Kanani’s contributions and would miss their involvement in the Polygon platform. </p><p>The co-founder’s quiet departure marks both a new phase for Polygon, as it continues towards its “road to 2.0” and, perhaps, an opportunity for them to work on more recent business endeavors. Kanani’s LinkedIn profile <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdkanani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">shows</a> that they’ve founded two tech companies in 2023, Morphic and Mozak.</p><h3>FTX-SBF charges valid despite lack of US crypto laws, DOJ says</h3><p>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion in court on Oct. 4, claiming the lack of crypto regulations in the U.S. is no bar to the criminal charges made against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).</p><p>The DOJ’s letter was filed in response to the defendant’s lawyers argument that their client was “not guilty because FTX was not regulated in the United States, and he followed the rules concerning FTX US.”</p><p>The DOJ called this argument irrelevant, claiming that even though the existence of legislation may be necessary to prove a legal obligation, the lack of it does not affect whether the defendant’s victims committed money to him. The DOJ noted that the defendant’s claim about a lack of regulations related to customer funds usage is false as there are existing rules against it.</p><p>The DOJ further argued that the existing laws prohibit companies from stealing customer assets, and the defendant has been charged under the same. Furthermore, the defendant committed substantial misrepresentations to customers, as well as having stolen money from them.</p><p>The DOJ argued that it is irrelevant to whether the defendant made substantial misstatements or omissions in the supposed “absence of clearly applicable laws or regulations.“ It cannot be proven that the wire fraud allegations are “actus reus,” meaning a guilty act, regardless of whether there is regulation or not.</p><p>SBF faced his first day of jury trial on Oct.3, with reports suggesting the trial could last as long as six weeks.</p><h2>Judge rejects SEC’s motion to file interlocutory appeal in Ripple case</h2><p>In an Oct. 3 court order, Judge Analisa Torres rejected the SEC's motion to file an immediate appeal over its loss against Ripple Labs, the company responsible for issuing the XRP token.</p><p>Torres declared that the financial regulator failed to meet its burden to show that there were controlling questions of law or that there were substantial grounds for differences of opinion on the ruling.</p><p>Crypto lawyer Jeremey Hogan declared the rejection a “disaster” for the agency, saying that the appeal allowed Torres to explain parts of her ruling even further. According to Hogan, this means that a future appeal from the SEC would be even more difficult to win.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The SEC&#39;s motion for interlocutory appeal DENIED.<br><br>Which means, the case either goes to trial in April, or goes away.<br><br>AND, this Order allowed the Judge to explain parts of her ruling even better, making appeal that much harder for the SEC to win.<br><br>Disaster for the agency. <a href=\"https://t.co/y1Gz8LolrG\">https://t.co/y1Gz8LolrG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hkktKMD4Ut\">pic.twitter.com/hkktKMD4Ut</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1709358286850675193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The framework was developed in cooperation with consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers International (PwC) and was <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pwc.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fservices%2Fassets%2Fpwc-blockchain-to-foster-financial-inclusion.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">explained</a> in a white paper published on September 25. </p><p>Using this framework, the teams concluded that blockchain payments solutions significantly increased access to financial products by lowering fees to 1% or less. They also found that blockchain products have increased the speed of payments and helped users to avoid inflation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/8dd71be3-95cc-4319-aecf-cebca0435776.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Financial inclusion framework parameters. Source: Stellar, PwC.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some blockchain developers claim their products can enhance “financial inclusion.” In other words, they say their products can provide services to unbanked people living in the developing world. Making this claim has become an effective way for some Web3 projects to gain funding. For example, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/innovation/InnovationFund/blockchain-financial-inclusion-cohort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">listed</a> eight blockchain projects that it has helped fund so far based on this idea.</p><p>However, in their paper, Stellar and PwC argued that projects can fail to enhance financial inclusion if they don’t have a framework for evaluating what is needed for success. “As with any technological innovation, the need for robust governance and responsible design principles are key to successful implementation,” they said.</p><p>To help foster this governance, the two teams proposed a framework to judge whether a project will likely promote financial inclusion. The framework consists of four parameters: access, quality, trust and usage. Each of these parameters is broken down into further sub-parameters. For example, “access” is broken down further into affordability, connectivity, and ease of initiation.</p><p>Each explanation of a sub-parameter includes a proposed way of measuring it. For example, Stellar and PwC list “# of CICO [cash in/cash out] locations within relevant target population region” as a way of measuring the “connectivity” metric. This is intended to help ensure that projects can scientifically measure their effectiveness instead of relying on guesswork.</p><p>The teams also suggested a four-phase assessment process that projects should undergo to solve a financial inclusion problem. The project should identify a solution, target population, and relevant jurisdiction in the first phase. In phase 2, they should identify barriers preventing the target population from receiving financial services. In phase 3, they should use “level charts and guidance” to determine the biggest roadblocks to onboarding users. And in the final phase, they should implement solutions that “prioritize key parameters” to make the most effective use of funds.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/928a45a0-4638-4852-9b48-f5d4aeec86da.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Phases to implement financial inclusiveness framework. Source: Stellar, PwC.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Using this framework, the teams identified at least two blockchain solutions that have proven to be effective at enhancing financial inclusion. The first is payments. The teams found that traditional financial apps charge an average of 2.7-3.5% to send money between the United States and the market being studied, whereas blockchain-based solutions charged 1% or less, based on a study of 12 applications operating in Colombia, Argentina, Kenya, and the Philippines. They found that these applications increased access by making electronic payments available to people who otherwise couldn’t afford them. </p><p>The second effective solution they found was savings. The team claimed that a stablecoin application in Argentina allows users to invest in an inflation-resistant digital asset, helping them to preserve their wealth when they otherwise would have lost it.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentina-presidential-candidate-push-cbdc-solve-hyperinflation-elections\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/argentina-presidential-candidate-push-cbdc-solve-hyperinflation-elections/amp\"><strong>Argentine presidential candidate wants CBDCs to ‘solve’ hyperinflation</strong></a></em></p><p>Stellar network has been on the forefront of payment inclusion in underserved financial markets.

The nuances of how to accomplish that goal, or even what “financial inclusion” means, remain to be explored, a Bank of Canada discussion paper said. It concluded that central banks will face a range of unfamiliar and nontraditional challenges to create an inclusive CBDC. </p><p>By “identifying material barriers and describing the realities of inequity underlying the aggregate statistics that are commonly used” the authors of the paper identified three types of inclusion necessary for a universally accessible payment method: financial inclusion, digital inclusion and practical accessibility. Private financial institutions may not have an incentive to address the needs of those who are underserved. In this light, the authors <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdp2023-22.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a>:</p><blockquote>“Our analysis suggests that the number of individuals who face barriers or exclusion is much larger than was previously assumed.”</blockquote><p>Unless all three aspects of accessibility are accounted for, persons who experience challenges in one type of inclusion may have the same disadvantages if a CBDC is introduced, the authors state. For example, members of the First Nations on average live at a much greater distance from financial institutions than other Canadians (25 km. vs. 1.9 km.) and their financial inclusion would depend on digital inclusion.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/8b5816dc-20b3-4516-8616-4cb8859658ea.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">The elements of financial inclusion. Source: Bank of Canada </figcaption></figure><p>Financial literacy and ease of use come into play as well. First Nations youth are likely to have digital access but be less skilled in the use of digital technology than their non-Indigenous peers, the authors say. Other Canadians may be hesitant to use digital technology due to exaggerated fears about security. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NTRD?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NTRD</a>, show your support by taking part in your local activities. <br> <br>Start your learning journey:  <br> <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/EW9h8ipiFK\">https://t.co/EW9h8ipiFK</a>  <br><br> <a href=\"https://t.co/OP0c25sx8N\">https://t.co/OP0c25sx8N</a>  <br> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TruthandReconciliation?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TruthandReconciliation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OrangeShirtDay?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OrangeShirtDay</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rja20HuaS1\">pic.twitter.com/rja20HuaS1</a></p>— Bank of Canada (@bankofcanada) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofcanada/status/1708104509799514560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Cognitive load – the level of difficulty in using digital financial technology – and other usability issues are potential barriers to accessibility that are likely to grow as the population ages.

The problem requires “deeper research into design for cognitive accessibility,” the authors said.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/insurance-agriculture-real-estate-asset-tokenization-reshaping-status-quo\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/insurance-agriculture-real-estate-asset-tokenization-reshaping-status-quo/amp\">Insurance, agriculture, real estate: How asset tokenization is reshaping the status quo</a></em></strong></p><p>Disabled people may experience greater difficulty in using the technology as well.
