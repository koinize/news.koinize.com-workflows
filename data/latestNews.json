    "description": "<p>South Korean authorities have arrested the CEO of the Bitsonic crypto exchange, Jinwook Shin, for allegedly stealing $7.5 million dollars of user funds.&nbsp;</p>\nEmbezzlement Allegations\n<p>Jinwook Shin was taken into custody by South Korean authorities on August 7th after an investigation uncovered that the CEO had been allegedly embezzling investments and deposits belonging to the exchange's users during the time period between January 2019 and May 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the initial report, Shin allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities that manipulated cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately $7.5 million (10 billion won) from user funds.&nbsp;</p>\nLiquidity Issues Leads To Shutdown\n<p>Despite facing liquidity problems and suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Shin continued to provide cryptocurrencies to new customers. This persistence drew the attention of the Seoul cyber crime department, which alleged that Shin failed to purchase cryptocurrencies during this period, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of the exchange's operations.</p>\n<p>In August 2021, the platform finally announced the closure of its operations, attributing the decision to \"internal and external issues.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This announcement was followed by the shutdown of 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms by South Korean authorities, who were investigating alleged fraudulent activities.</p>\nVice President Also Complicit\n<p>The investigation further implicated the vice president of Bitsonic, who is believed to have played a role in devising a scheme to acquire the cryptocurrencies held by the CEO within the exchange system. The VP, who is referred to as Mr. A, was allegedly working hand-in-hand with Shin to buy the cryptocurrency held by the latter on the exchange platform. A shell company established in Singapore was allegedly used in the process of manipulation.</p>\nGovernment's Stance Against Fraud And Cybercrime\n<p>South Korean authorities have recently taken a tough stance against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry. Last month, the Korea Securities Depository partnered with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to address the rise in unlawful activities within the virtual asset market. This partnership aims to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to enhance investor protection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the government has also been working on a crypto-tracking system, including an interagency investigation team, to counter cybercrime as a part of its commitment to ensuring the security and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>\n<p>As the investigation into the alleged embezzlement unfolds, South Korea's proactive approach against fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency sector continues to underscore the nation's commitment to fostering a secure and trustworthy digital asset environment.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-cuts-saga-price-40-sol-ytd-high/",
    "description": "Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, announced a significant 40% price reduction for its Saga smartphone, slashing the price from its initial $1,000 to a more affordable $599. This move comes just four months after the phone&#8217;s launch, sparking a flurry of reactions from the crypto community. The official statement from the company suggests that the price cut is a strategic move to foster wider adoption of mobile web3 and to enhance the user experience for the Solana mobile community. However, on-chain data paints a slightly different picture. According to data compiled by Flipside Crypto, sales of the Solana Saga have seen a sharp decline since their peak in April and May. This is evidenced by the number of Saga Genesis NFT mints, which are generated when a user sets up their Solana Saga smartphone and accesses the Solana app store. The chart below shows a clear downward trend of sales. Since June sales volume has been extremely flat after a successful May 2023. The price reduction has elicited mixed reactions on Twitter / X. While some early adopters expressed their frustration at purchasing the device at its original price, others defended the move, pointing out the benefits of being an early bird. Notably, early owners had the exclusive opportunity to mint Claynosaurz NFTs, which currently have a floor price of around 33 SOL on Magic Eden, translating to over $800.

At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $24.38. A look at the daily chart shows that SOL was able to confirm the breakout from its downtrend channel on Monday after the price found support at both the channel&#8217;s trend line and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). As a result of this bullish confirmation, SOL broke above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $23.94. For now, it looks like SOL can defend the level and make a new run towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.42. Related Reading: Solana Beats Out Ethereum To Emerge As Best Performer In Terms Of TVL Remarkably, on July 14, SOL reached its year-to-date peak of $32.36 and recoiled from the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Subsequently, SOL dipped below the 61.8% Fibonacci level and couldn&#8217;t sustain a daily close above it. Given this context, the $27.42 price point emerges as the most pivotal resistance currently. Should a breakout occur, a clear path to the year&#8217;s high would be established. In this case, a bullish breakout seems imminent. However, strong profit taking can be expected around $32.36.Â If the yearly high falls, though, the bulls could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $56.86.
