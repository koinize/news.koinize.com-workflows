    "description": "Since Ethereum (ETH) peaked at $2,717 in the last two weeks, the asset has experienced a gradual decline, culminating in its arrival at a key demand zone, which could be instrumental in determining its imminent price trajectory, according to a prominent crypto analyst. Critical Support Zone Flags Continuous Bearish Move Renowned crypto analyst Ali has pinpointed a critical demand zone for ETH, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460. The resilience of this support level could pave the way for an upward trajectory, offering Ethereum a much-needed respite from bearish pressures. Related Reading: Market Dips, Whales Play: Bitcoin And Ethereum Snagged By Savvy Investors However, should Ethereum falter, a bearish slide to the next major support level of around $2,000 may be imminent. Such a decline would represent a significant drop of nearly 20% from its current price around the $2,300 mark, posing a stern test for Ethereum&#8217;s market upward stability. #Ethereum Market Update: $ETH is currently in a key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460. If this support holds strong, there&#8217;s a clear path ahead with minimal resistance, offering a potential for upward movement. ‚ö†Ô∏è However, if #ETH fails to maintain this level, we‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/F0HfyrSdGF ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) January 21, 2024 Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has witnessed a noticeable 4.3% decrease in value, breaching Ali&#8217;s critical demand zone. Currently, ETH trades at $2,368, signaling a possibility of a further plunge from here. This price dip is mirrored in Ethereum&#8217;s trading volume, which has seen a significant decrease from $19 billion last Monday to just over $10 billion today, indicating lesser trading activity and a shift in investor sentiment. Ethereum&#8217;s Market Dynamics: Whales Buying Dip and Rising Dominance The current market dip has not gone unnoticed by savvy investors. According to Lookonchain, a crypto analytics platform, a prominent Ethereum whale has capitalized on the opportunity, acquiring 3,600 ETH valued at around $8.9 million. After the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago. This whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs. The profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024 This strategic move is part of a larger pattern observed in the whale&#8217;s trading history, marked by buying low and selling high. This tactic has reportedly amassed profits estimated at $25.8 million.
