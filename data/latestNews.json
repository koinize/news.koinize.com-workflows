According to a report from Bitfinex, This year has marked a significant milestone for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have shown remarkable growth, leaving traditional assets like gold behind. Bitcoin has soared by 93% and Ethereum by 3%, indicating a solid performance correlation that has remained consistently tight. BTC, in particular, has enjoyed the spotlight with its first-mover advantage, earning the moniker of &#8216;digital gold&#8217; and garnering broad institutional support. While these digital assets reach new heights, traditional stock indices such as the S&#38;P 500 and NASDAQ are navigating through a correction phase. This contrast hints at a shifting investment landscape, with cryptocurrencies emerging as a dominant force capable of outperforming established markets, the report suggested.

Crypto Stands Firm In Economic Uncertainty Despite the Fed&#8217;s updated, confident view of the U.S. economy, the manufacturing sector experienced a downturn in October, mainly due to strikes in the automotive industry. This suggests a significant impact of labor disputes on the sector. The broader U.S. economy is feeling the effects, with a slowdown in job creation and the slowest wage growth since mid-2021, indicating a shift in labor market conditions. This data supports a continuation of the current bullish trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase?
