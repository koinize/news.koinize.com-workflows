It almost accentuates the kind of environment that we have in Europe and the UK.”</blockquote><p>Young added that Ripple continues to foster private public partnerships and open dialogue with regulators and policymakers, with both parties educating each other as the industry develops:</p><blockquote>“It does enable business to grow and innovation to happen. I would say we're very fortunate in this sort of UK, Europe environment which is setting standards globally.”</blockquote><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-is-killing-innovation-in-united-states-1inch-co-founder\">SEC is killing innovation in the United States — 1inch co-founder</a></em></strong></p><p>In a European context, Young believes that the MiCA regulatory framework will facilitate the creation of a ‘level playing field’ that fosters healthy competition and innovation in the cryptocurrency space while driving adoption among traditional finance players.</p><blockquote>“I think that's where we've seen much bigger mainstream take up and the real benefits of crypto’s utility being realized. Without clear regulation that is impossible. I see that as the first step in getting more mainstream adoption.”</blockquote><p>Young highlighted Ripple’s expanding basket of services aimed at plugging into an increasingly interconnected financial ecosystem. This is in part facilitated by crucial fiat onramps and offramps as well as the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins:</p><blockquote>“It's really a number of different currencies and CBDCs. They're all going to be coexisting and that kind of ability to interoperate, to go in and out is going to be very important.”</blockquote><p>Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC took an<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hinman-docs-unsealed-sec-concerned-over-ether-not-security-statement\"> interesting turn in June 2023</a>, as eagerly awaited documents relating to a speech from former SEC corporate finance division director Bill Hinman <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hinman-docs-unsealed-sec-concerned-over-ether-not-security-statement\">highlighted contradictory viewpoints</a> on the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-bedford-soccer-team-puts-bitcoin-on-the-map/\">Peter McCormack’s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
