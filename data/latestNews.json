Riley will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified number of Bitdeer's shares over three years. The agreement's rules include a maximum purchase of 1 million shares or 25% of Bitdeer's shares traded on the Nasdaq during the purchase period. </p><p>\"Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II, up to US$150,000,000 of its Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.0000001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement,\" reads the filing.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/cc4495e3-1284-45a3-be67-65b085aea843.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bitdeer-B.

A SPAC deal involves a special purpose acquisition company merging with a private firm, taking it public without a traditional initial public offering (IPO) process.</p><p>The deal gives B.

Riley an ownership stake in the crypto mining company. </p><p>As part of the transaction, Bitdeer will pay B. Riley 0.5% of the deal's value in exchange for its commitment to purchase the shares. B. Riley will also be reimbursed for legal fees and disbursements up to $50,000. </p><p>Founded by former Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Bitdeer provides cloud-mining services through its U.S.-based data centers in Tennessee, Washington and Texas.
