    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/if-bitcoin-clears-70000-how-fast-will-ethereum-ease-past-5000/",
    "description": "As Bitcoin surges towards its all-time high (ATH) of nearly $70,000, analysts are closely watching Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency, wondering how quickly it will follow suit and break its record ATHs of approximately $5,000 printed in late 2021. How Will Ethereum React When Bitcoin Breaks Above $70,000? One analyst, posting on platform X, highlights the difference in the two coins&#8217; positions compared to the last time Bitcoin broke above 2017 highs of $20,000 in December 2020. Then, Ethereum was trading at $600, a full 57% below its previous ATH of about $1,400.  As Bitcoin nears its record peak of around $70,000 registered in December 2021, Ethereum is approaching $4,000. However, the difference between then and now is that ETH is about 36% shy of its ATH of around $5,000.  Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink, Price Soars Above $68,000 – Will BTC Break Its 2021 Record? The question in the analyst&#8217;s mind is, considering historical performance, how fast ETH will ease past $5,000. When Bitcoin broke above $20,000 in late December 2020, the analyst notes that it took approximately two months for ETH to sweep past $1,400 and record new highs. The boom after this breakout lifted ETH to around $5,000, accelerated mainly by retail activities cycling around decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) minting. Looking at the Ethereum price action in the daily chart, it is clear that buyers are in control. ETH prices, CoinMarketCap data reveals, are up roughly 7% in the past 24 hours and 15% in the previous week. However, how quickly ETH might repeat the prior 2020-2021 feat remains to be seen.  Exploring ETH&#8217;s Chances Like in the past, the Ethereum price action benefits from the Bitcoin expansion. The revival in Bitcoin prices has seen capital flow to Ethereum, priming its broader ecosystem comprising DeFi and NFT protocols. DeFiLlama data shows that Ethereum manages over $56 billion worth of assets. Notably, almost all top DeFi protocols in Ethereum, including Lido, Maker, Uniswap, and EigenLayer, have posted strong inflows in the past day, week, and month. Aside from market-related factors, Ethereum prices are also steadied by hopes around the eventual approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock is among the leading asset managers to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  However, the agency postponed a ruling on BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot Ethereum ETF, citing concerns about the network&#8217;s new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The SEC expressed worries that staking, a core aspect of proof-of-stake, could create opportunities for manipulation.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Skyrockets 45%, Surges Past $0.000045: Here’s Why The clear reservation regarding proof-of-stake cast a shadow on Ethereum&#8217;s near-term outlook despite the current uptick in prices. Still, the community finds relief realizing that the Commission rejected approving a spot Bitcoin ETF for roughly ten years before January 2024. Feature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView"
