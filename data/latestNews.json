The Senate hearing will regard the SEC's oversight on certain matters. </p><p>“Given this industry’s wide-ranging noncompliance with the securities laws, it’s not surprising that we’ve seen many problems in these markets. We’ve seen this story before. It’s reminiscent of what we had in the 1920s before the federal securities laws were put in place,” reads Gensler’s prepared testimony. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW: Ahead of tomorrow’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BankingGOP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BankingGOP</a> hearing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GaryGensler</a> released the testimony he will give to the committee.

Judge Torres found that the sales of XRP tokens to retail consumers did not violate federal securities laws. </p><p>While the SEC is currently pursuing an appeal of this decision, it's expected that many other crypto companies staring down lawsuits from the regulator will reference it in their respective dismissal motions. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-clo-calls-sec-latest-filing-hypocritical-pivot\"><strong><em>Ripple lawyer calls SEC’s latest filing “hypocritical pivot”</em></strong></a></p><p>On Aug. 29, the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">SEC suffered its second major loss</a> against Grayscale over the prior rejection of its request to convert its over-the-counter Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).
