The announcement created controversy in the crypto community with many calling it a rug-pull as the price of the native token on different subreddits tanked after the announcements. </p><p>Each subreddit had its own native token. For example, the Moons (MOON) token was the native crypto asset of the r/CryptoCurrency board, while Bricks (BRICK) was for the r/FortNiteBR subreddit. Users could spend these points on badges and exclusive items for their avatars. </p><p>At the time of the announcement the moderators of most of the subreddits involved with the community points program claimed to be unaware of the decision. However, this is now being called into question as new on-chain data suggest at least a couple of moderators holding Moon tokens may have been linked to three wallets that dumped millions of the tokens shortly before the actual announcement.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-community-tokens-soar-kraken-listing\"><strong><em>Reddit community tokens soar on Kraken listing</em></strong></a></p><p>On-chain analysts such as Pledditor were the first to draw attention to the actions of a subreddit moderator with the pseudonym Mcgillby. On-chain data reveals that this moderator transferred more than 100,000 Moons over two different transactions on the Arbitrum Nova blockchain, turning them into more than $23,000 in ETH. The user subsequently deleted all earlier Reddit posts.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Reddit</a> admins told /r/CryptoCurrency moderators beforehand, and 3 moderators sold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$MOON</a> tokens on insider information<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$MOON</a> price dropped -22% minutes before the announcement was posted<br><br>Here is a list of Reddit moderators acting on inside information BEFORE the announcement: <a href=\"https://t.co/xAh75hOVEa\">pic.twitter.com/xAh75hOVEa</a></p>&mdash; Pledditor (@Pledditor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1714610041699930439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In another incident, just 17 minutes before Reddit's open statement, \"rider_of_the_storm,\" a different moderator, allegedly shifted 345,422 Moons, worth over $69,000 at the time, to an exchange address.
