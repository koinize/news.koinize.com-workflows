More recently, Aldo Antonio, co-founder and acting executive chairman of the National Transporters Alliance Group (NTAG) revealed his efforts to spread Jam-Dex adoption among the transport community. </p><p>According to a local <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/jam-dex-drive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a> from Jamaica Observer, Antonio sees a lower curiosity in CBDCs among bus and taxi drivers — primarily due to a sluggish adoption rate among vendors and consumers. Regardless, Antonio remains optimistic:</p><blockquote>“I see Jam-Dex as something that would be significantly transformative for the public transportation sector and needs to be embraced.”</blockquote><p>In order to make Jam-Dex feasible, Antonio believes Jamaica needs more customers willing to use the CBDC. Failure to attract customers will discourage merchants and eventually result in the total abandonment of digital currency.</p><p>According to Antonio, food and transportation are the two main verticals that can increase the day-to-day Jam-Dex usage. He added:</p><blockquote>“If we can get them (Jamaicans) moving and paying for transportation using Jam-Dex on a daily basis, it increases the rate at which we can get the digital currency into people's hands.”</blockquote><p>Moreover, CBDC’s widespread adoption eradicates the drivers’ concerns related to carrying cash or giving back the exact change. Jamaica is currently working toward enabling the CBDC services on mobile phones of the general public. “With that happening and training happening, then the sector could be in a position by January, if not before, to be able to accept Jam-Dex-type payments,” Antonio concluded. </p><p>An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 transport owners reside in Jamaica, who can help expand Jam-Dex’s reach beyond the existing 10,000 vendors with 200,000 people that use the CBDC through the digital wallet Lynk.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-twitter-is-not-happy-with-the-name-and-logo-of-jamaican-cbdc\"><strong><em>Crypto Twitter is not happy with the name and logo of Jamaica’s CBDC</em></strong></a></p><p>While Jamaica banks on taxi drivers to expedite its CBDC adoption, Japanese auto-maker Nissan ramped up its Web3 efforts.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NISSAN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NISSAN</a> has filed 4 trademark applications for<br>▶️ INFINITI<br>▶️ NISMO<br>▶️ NISSAN<br><br>The filings signal plans for<br>Virtual Clothes + Cars<br>Stores for Virtual Goods + NFTs<br>NFT Marketplaces + Trading + Minting<br>Metaverse Advertising Services<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTCommunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFTCommunity</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Metaverse</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Web3</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Car?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Car</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iG3ZVgyD5t\">pic.twitter.com/iG3ZVgyD5t</a></p>&mdash; Mike Kondoudis (@KondoudisLaw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KondoudisLaw/status/1635080016265641985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>In Q1 2023, Nissan filed four new Web3-related trademarks filed in the United States.

    "description": "\n                        <p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto exchange Binance has set up a dedicated Polish entity that will comply with Belgian regulations to cater to its Belgian clients.&nbsp;</p>\nBelgians To Use Binance Poland\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After facing regulatory roadblocks, Binance has cracked the code on how to continue serving its Belgian clients. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has recently unveiled its latest entity, which will serve such clients while complying with Belgian regulatory guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a blog announcement released on Monday, the team revealed that it will be using its Polish arm to cater to Belgian clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team wrote,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We are pleased to announce that Binance Poland sp. z o.o. is now the entity that provides Binance services for Belgian residents. By doing this, Binance ensures that it complies with its regulatory obligations and can continue to provide services to Belgian users.&rdquo;</p>\n\nFSMA Ordered Operations Halt&nbsp;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The move to refocus a part of the firm&rsquo;s Poland arm for Belgian users was taken after significant pushback from the country&rsquo;s financial services regulatory. Like regulators in several other countries, in June 2023, Belgium&rsquo;s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) ordered the company to halt all digital asset services being provided in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FSMA said,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Binance is offering and providing exchange services in Belgium between virtual currencies and legal currencies, as well as custody wallet services, from countries that are not members of the European Economic Area&hellip;The FSMA has therefore ordered Binance to cease, with immediate effect, offering or providing any and all such services in Belgium.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\nNew KYC For Registered Users\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To tackle this matter and maintain regulatory compliance, the service provider is redirecting its Belgian customers to the Polish branch, where it is a registered virtual assets service provider (VASP).&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Belgian customers will need to agree to a new Terms of Use for Binance Poland to be able to access the trading platform once again. Registered users might need to provide further KYC documents to meet a new regulatory checklist, which will be communicated to the affected customers in due time.&nbsp;</p>\nBinance&rsquo;s Regulatory Troubles\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Belgium is just one of the many countries that are concerned about Binance and its regulatory compliance. The crypto agency is already under tremendous fire from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that has launched a lawsuit against it in a bid to protect U.S. customer funds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Department of Justice (DOJ) has also pursued legal actions against the crypto exchange, claiming that it has been supporting sanctioned banks in Russia. However, it is clear that the firm is eager to appease regulatory bodies, as it has recently imposed strict restrictions on peer-to-peer trading for Russian users and is considering exiting the market entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
