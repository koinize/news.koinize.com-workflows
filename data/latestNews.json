The pair is now at risk of more downsides below the $0.5000 support zone. XRP Price Faces Many Hurdles In the past few days, XRP price saw a downside reaction below the $0.550 pivot level. The bears remained active and were able to push the price below the $0.500 support zone. Recently, there was a recovery wave above the $0.500 level.
