Ferrari’s choice to accept cryptocurrency payments was driven by market demand and dealer requests, with numerous clients, including crypto-savvy young investors, having invested in digital currencies. </p><p>Although Galliera didn’t specify the number of cars Ferrari expects to sell via crypto payments, he reportedly stated that the carmaker’s strong order portfolio is fully booked until 2025. Ferrari aims to test this expanding market to connect with potential buyers beyond its usual clientele. The luxury automaker plans to introduce cryptocurrency payments in Europe by the first quarter of 2024 and expand to other crypto-friendly regions after. </p><p>For its initial phase in the U.S., Ferrari has reportedly partnered with major cryptocurrency payment processor, BitPay. This collaboration enables transactions in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) and USD Coin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index#:~:text=USD%20Coin%20(USDC)%20explained&amp;text=Constructed%20using%20Centre's%20open%2Dsource,USDC%20statedly%20redeemable%20for%20%241.\">USDC</a>).</p><p>Galliera confirmed that there will be no additional fees or surcharges when using cryptocurrency, as BitPay will promptly convert cryptocurrency payments into conventional fiat currency for Ferrari’s dealers, ensuring they are shielded from cryptocurrency price fluctuations.</p><p>BitPay will also verify the legitimacy of the digital currency, ensuring it does not originate from illicit activities, money laundering or tax evasion.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-madeira-announces-bitcoin-innovation-hub\"><strong><em>Madeira announces creation of Bitcoin business hub for innovation</em></strong></a></p><p>Many large corporations have hesitated to adopt cryptocurrencies due to their price volatility and associated transaction impracticality.

However, CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-loses-6-in-an-hour-after-tesla-drops-payments-over-carbon-concerns\">suspended this payment method</a> due to environmental concerns. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/cuba-bitcoin-revolution-adoption-embargo/\"><strong><em>The Truth Behind Cuba’s Bitcoin Revolution: An on-the-ground report</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
