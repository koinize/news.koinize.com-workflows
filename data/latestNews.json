    "description": "Ethereum price took a major hit like Bitcoin and dropped over $350. ETH tested the $2,000 support and is currently attempting a fresh increase. Ethereum declined over 8% and broke the $2,200 support zone. The price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could rise again unless there is a close below the $2,100 support zone. Ethereum Price Took A Major Hit Ethereum price climbed further higher above the $2,300 level.
