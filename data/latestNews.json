Fraud cases that reveal the weaknesses of centralized structures underscore the importance of self-custodial protocols.

Understanding blockchain complexities, like gas fees and native tokens, can be challenging for those managing their assets directly. Also, key crypto figures suggest self-custody models <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/diversified-set-of-guardians-required-for-safe-self-custody-vitalik-buterin\">need to maximize safety</a> against coercion.
