    "description": "Shibarium, the Ethereum Layer network from the Shiba Inu team, has had a rocky few months following its highly anticipated launch. After surging immediately following its launch, its figures dropped as interest waned. However, there has been a change in the performance as transaction numbers are spiking once again. Transaction Numbers Jump 288% On Shibarium In the last few days, there has been a marked increase in the number of transactions carried out on the Shibarium network. The Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain saw a nice jump from November 19 to November 22. Related Reading: Did JPMorgan Secretly Buy 7.5 Million XRP? Here’s What We Know On November 19, the total number of transactions on the network was 8,930. But as of November 22, this figure is sitting at an impressive 34,670 transactions. This represents a 288% increase in the space of three days. As a result, the total number of transactions carried out on the network since inception has now crossed 3.578 million. Transaction numbers spike 288% &#124; Source: ShibariumScan There was also a small uptick in the number of active accounts on the network, albeit to a smaller extent compared to the transaction count. Active accounts went from 569 on November 20 to 648 on November 22. However, amid all of these, the amount of new blocks created on the network took a nosedive. Between November 20 and November 22, the number of new blocks created on Shibarium went from 17,214 to 13,907, a 20% decrease in two days. SHIB price crashes alongside Bitcoin &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down? Despite the immense growth recorded in the Shibarium over the last few days, the Shiba Inu price has not followed this trend. Rather, the meme coin is seeing losses, especially on the 24-hour chart and this can be attributed to the general crypto market downtrend. Related Reading: AVAX Open Interest Climbs 10.4% To $224 Million, Is $30 Possible? The crypto market saw a crash after Changpeng Zhao announced he would be stepping down as the CEO of Binance and that the exchange had agreed to a $4 billion fine with the DOJ. As a result, the price of Bitcoin dropped from above $36,000 to mid-$35,000s before recovery. However, the damage was already done and it dragged the altcoin market down with it. Currently, the price of Shiba Inu is down 3.62% to trade at $0.000008061. This decline follows the Bitcoin trend, suggesting that a recovery in the Bitcoin price would translate into a recovery in the Shiba Inu price as well.
