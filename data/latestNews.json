Now he’s found his place as a gothic VR dream creator</p>\n                    <p><p><strong>From sitting in his car crying before work every morning to becoming a successful digital artist, the story of Australian-based VR painter and sculptor Giant Swan is one of persistence, timing and pushing boundaries. </strong></p><p>In a world where a digital artist can now monetize their work through NFTs as opposed to cheap likes and comments on Instagram, Giant Swan stands out from the pack, being the first artist to put a 3D object on-chain and for his truly unique and immersive pieces that have captured the attention of collectors all over the globe, including renowned whales such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/j1mmyeth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >j1mmy.eth</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ModeratsArt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Moderats Art</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhaleSharkETH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Whale Shark</a>. </p><p>For me, crying in the car before work was a lot to do with knowing that you should be somewhere else. I knew I didnt fit with what I was doing. To be where you suddenly belong, I think, is what every artist is probably striving for in some way, Giant Swan says. </p><p>After minting his first NFT on Nov. 30, 2019, on Known Origin, Giant Swan caught the initial wave of interest in digital art. He credits the likes of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/selfmadeheroes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >David Moore</a> from Known Origin for helping him take the plunge. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks for waiting, I have something to share with you now.<br><br>This is \"The Young Cerberus.\" <br><br>I preach to elevate always, this week I think I really pushed myself on that a little more to get to here.<br><br>I hope you&#39;re all well.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nft?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >#nft</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuperRare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >@SuperRare</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Nc48MxKHPH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >https://t.co/Nc48MxKHPH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gfsFWrlr0J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/gfsFWrlr0J</a></p>— Giant Swan  (@A_Giant_Swan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/A_Giant_Swan/status/1379093981770833921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >April 5, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dreamlike-states\"><strong>Dreamlike states </strong></h2><p>You can get lost viewing Giant Swans art; the depth of his work often needs to be seen to be believed. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-art-pioneer-upload-brain-internet-live-forever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >OG Crypto artist Josie Bellini</a> described it thus: </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I look at Giant Swans work, you cant stop thinking, and you start to feel a certain way.

I do that by wearing a virtual reality headset that places me into an empty void. Theres no roof, there’s no floor, there’s no walls; it’s just endless.

VR art lets us explore imperfection, and in that, it enables a very digital art medium to become one of the most organic digital art forms available.

Really thrash, almost impressionistic kind of take on 3D art. I love to hit gothic notes and symbolism. I like drawing from a lot of things, but I wouldnt know how to name it. That’s why it’s Giant Swan style. Thats why people can pick me out in the crowd because you can’t put it in a bin.</p><p><strong><em>Who are the influences on your art career to date?</em></strong></p><p>Ive got lots of influences, but to name a few. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleywood3a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Ashley Wood</a> worked on Tank Girl, which is a loose inky comic book style. Also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Hewlett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Jamie Hewlett</a>, who does all the imagery behind The Gorillaz and Tank Girl. </p><p>The Gorillaz were an influence on me in that you used to get their CDs and to get all the extra stuff out of it. You had to put it into your PC but they never said that; you just put the CD in, and you’d explore and find all the cool stuff. It was an experience. That really informs how I see my work. Now I want my work to be experienced. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/hundreds-millions-spent-marketing-crypto-sports-fans-wasted/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Billions are spent marketing crypto to sports fans  Is it worth it?</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Bitcoin is on a collision course with Net Zero promises</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p><strong><em>Is there an up-and-coming artist/s you think people should be paying attention to?</em></strong></p><p>Theres a Melbourne artist named Mysterious Al.
