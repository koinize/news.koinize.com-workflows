According to the announcement, Maestrobots paid a total of 610 ETH in its own revenue to cover all the user losses, worth more than $1 million at the time of writing.</p><p>“Every wallet that lost tokens in the router exploit has now received the full amount they lost. Some of you ended up with even bigger bags,” Maestro wrote.</p><p>The Maestro team noted that some amounts were paid back in affected tokens and ETH. For nine out of the 11 exploited tokens, Maestro chose to buy and refund tokens instead of sending ETH because “it's the most equitable and complete refund” it could offer. “We spent 276 ETH to secure our users' tokens,” Maestro added.</p><p>Affected users of the other two exploited tokens — including JOE and LMI — were refunded in ETH, Maestro said, citing lack of liquidity to buy back the lost tokens. The announcement added:</p><blockquote>“So we compensated affected users with the ETH equivalent of their tokens, and boosted that amount by 20% because you deserve it. These refunds cost 334 ETH.”</blockquote><p>Blockchain security firm CertiK confirmed to Cointelegraph that it has been able to detect the transactions showing the 334 ETH compensation paid out to users from Maestro.</p><p>The refunds came shortly after Maestro reported that the MaestroRouter on ETH mainnet was <a href=\"https://x.com/MaestroBots/status/1716969767804747820?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">compromised</a> on Oct. 24, allowing hackers to siphon around 280 ETH in exploited tokens, worth around $485,000 at the time of the hack. The Maestro team said it identified the attack within 30 minutes after the start and fully removed the exploit. The platform also quickly resumed trading, temporarily halting tokens with pools on SushiSwap, ShibaSwap and ETH PancakeSwap.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rug-pulls-audits-report-hacken\"><strong><em>85% of crypto rug pulls in Q3 didn’t report audits: Hacken</em></strong></a></p><p>“Wallets were not compromised at all during this attack. This was purely directed at the Router,” Maestro wrote.</p><p>According to the executive summary by CertiK, Maestro's smart contract breach affected a total of 106 user addresses. The affected tokens included MOG, LMI, JOE, BANANA, OGGY, JIM, ETF, LP, APU, Real Smurf Cat and PROPHET.</p><p>“Most of these tokens pumped back up due to the anticipation that we were gonna market buy the tokens. Most of these tokens are still alive and kicking,” a spokesperson for Maestrobots told Cointelegraph.</p><p>Maestro, also known as MaestroBots on X, is a Telegram bot facilitating trades across three networks, including Ethereum, BNB Chain and Arbitrum, with a default transaction fee of 1%.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-rare-buy-signal/",
    "description": "Amid the bullish sentiment in the crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently garnered significant attention from traders and investors. A recent analysis by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has spotlighted a rare buy signal for the token, potentially hinting at an upward trajectory for its price. Buy Shiba Inu Now? For those not familiar, the TD Sequential is an indicator used by traders to identify potential price patterns and reversals. Developed by Tom DeMark, the TD Sequential is a series of numbers and letters that represent specific counts on a price chart. When the count reaches a &#8216;9&#8217; (TD9), it typically suggests a potential reversal in the market&#8217;s current trend, whether bullish or bearish. Its utility in predicting market turns has made it a staple in many traders&#8217; toolkits, especially in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: This Shibarium Milestone Could Rocket Shiba Inu To August Highs Ali Martinez, in a recent tweet, pointed out that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the Shiba Inu&#8217;s weekly chart. Such an occurrence isn&#8217;t just significant due to the potential for a bullish turn but also because of the infrequency of these signals. Historical data analysis reveals that in the last two instances when such a buy signal manifested, the SHIB price surged by 118% and 71%, respectively. These past performances, while no guarantee of future results, do provide a tantalizing backdrop to the current scenario. Martinez stated: The TD Sequential flashed a buy signal on [the] SHIB weekly chart. Notably, the previous two bullish turns from this indicator led to price surges of 118% and 71%, respectively. Given the infrequency yet precision of such signals, it&#8217;s a pivotal moment to keep a keen eye on SHIB. The TradingView chart, shared by Martinez, outlines the SHIB/TetherUS (USDT) Perpetual Contract on the Binance platform. It shows that back in June 2022, Shiba Inu recorded an impressive surge of approximately 117.80% within eight weeks. This rally was preceded by a &#8216;9&#8217; candlestick on the TD Sequential indicator, hinting at the buy setup. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Kusama Breaks Silence With Major Updates In late September 2023, another TD Sequential &#8216;9&#8217; buy signal emerged, resulting in a 71.17% ascent in SHIB&#8217;s value within the subsequent nine weeks. As of October 25, 2023, yet another &#8216;9&#8217; buy setup has manifested on the weekly time frame. Given the token&#8217;s historical reaction to these setups, a bullish move seems likely. However, while the TD Sequential is a respected tool, it&#8217;s worth noting that all indicators should be used in conjunction with other tools and analysis methods. The volatile nature of the crypto market means that predictions, even when based on historically successful indicators, come with inherent risks. A Consistent Signal At press time, the Shiba Inu price was trading at $0.00000732 and has thus managed to recapture the neckline of the descending triangle in the weekly chart. As detailed in earlier analysis, SHIB was in a make-or-break moment in the last two weeks. However, since SHIB was able to bounce above the neckline, the bullish scenario has now come to the fore. As was the case from June to early August 2022 after the formation of the third bottom (yellow circle), SHIB could now rally again towards the descending trend line of the triangle as a result of the fourth bottom (second yellow circle). Thus, the TD9 signal and this technical pattern coincide. As then, however, a new decisive moment would come for the Shiba Inu price &#8211; the battle to break out of a more than 2-year downtrend.
