    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-20-ethereum-20000/",
    "description": "Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has laid out a bullish narrative for Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. He claimed that both tokens could rise to as high as $20,000 and $20, respectively. Additionally, he stipulated when this parabolic price surge is likely to happen.  Ethereum Could Hit A Market Top Near $20,000 CrediBULL Crypto mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that there is a chance that Ethereum could hit a market peak near $20,000. He further explained that ETH could attain this price level based on his belief that BTC can “realistically” see a 2x in this market cycle from its last high of $69,000 in the 2021 bull run. As such, altcoins like ETH will do “multiples of that.”  Related Reading: Fantom Supply On Exchanges See Drastic Increase, A Cause For Alarm? Specifically, he foresees ETH doing a 3x to 4x of its prior all-time high (ATH) of $4,800, which puts the second largest crypto token by market cap in a price range between $15,000 and $20,000. Meanwhile, CrediBULL asserted that Ethereum will surely rise to $10,000 at the minimum.  Following CrediBULL’s prediction, another X user questioned how possible it was for ETH to rise to a market cap of $2 trillion, stating that it seems “crazy.” However, the crypto analyst responded that ETH rising to such levels is a “blow off top, &#8221; so the market cap will look “outrageous.” He jokingly added that there is a problem if the market caps don’t look outrageous.  XRP Is Another Altcoin That Could Experience Exponential Growth  In a different X post, CrediBULL also made a case for XRP, stating that XRP could also rise between $10 and $12 if ETH were to hit $10,000. He suggested that XRP wasn’t to be underrated despite its current underperformance, noting that XRP actually flipped ETH in terms of market cap at some point in the last cycle.   Related Reading: Crypto Expert Releases List Of Top 10 Altcoins To Buy For Maximum Profit In The Bull Market Therefore, the crypto analyst added that anyone who thinks ETH hitting $10,000 is “realistic” should also believe that XRP rising to $10 is possible. In a subsequent X post, CrediBULL claimed that XRP could even rise to as high as $20 based on ETH hitting $10,000 at its current circulating supply.  Again, he noted that XRP is very capable of attaining such price levels, seeing as it is a top 10 coin, which means that the market demand for it is evidently there. CrediBULL’s sentiment echoes that of Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, who previously predicted that XRP could rise to $10 since there were predictions that Bitcoin and Ethereum would rise to as high as $150,000 and $10,000, respectively.   At the time of writing, ETH and XRP are trading at around $3,290 and $0.58, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  XRP price at $0.57 &#124; Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Bitcoin Sistemi, chart from Tradingview.com"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-buy-analyst-matic-rebound-level/",
    "description": "An analyst has explained how a buy signal forming in the price of Polygon (MATIC) could lead to the asset rebounding towards these price targets. Polygon Is Showing A TD Sequential Buy Signal Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about the a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal forming in the MATIC price chart. The TD Sequential here refers to an indicator in technical analysis that&#8217;s generally used for pinpointing probable locations of reversal in any given asset&#8217;s value. This indicator has two phases to it, the first of which is known as the &#8220;setup.&#8221; In this phase, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine, at the end of which the price may be assumed to have encountered a point of reversal. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator May Have Signaled Latest Market Downturn In Advance Naturally, if the candles leading up to the completion of the setup had been red, the reversal would be towards the upside, while green candles would suggest a potential top for the asset. Once the setup is done with, the second phase called the &#8220;countdown&#8221; begins. This phase works similarly to the setup, except for the fact that it lasts for thirteen candles instead of nine. After these thirteen candles of the same polarity are also in, the price may be considered to have attained another likely point of reversal. Polygon has recently completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type. Below is the chart shared by Ali that shows the formation of this TD Sequential signal for the MATIC daily price. The recent pattern forming in the 1-day price of the cryptocurrency &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Polygon daily price has finished a TD Sequential setup with a downtrend recently. This would suggest that the asset may be at a potential bottom at the moment. &#8220;If MATIC stays strong above $0.87, we could see a rebound to $0.95, or better yet, $1!&#8221; says the analyst. A potential rally to the former of these targets would suggest an increase of more than 8% from the current price, while a run to the latter level would mean growth of almost 14%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss It now remains to be seen how the Polygon price will develop from here and if the TD Sequential buy signal will end up holding or not.
