    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-analysts-bullish-xrp-price/",
    "description": "Crypto analysts are currently optimistic about the XRP price trajectory in the coming months, setting different price targets, with some of them more bullish than others. XRP, like most top cryptocurrencies, is always subject to price predictions from analysts as the entire crypto market continues to anticipate the resumption of a market-wide rally.  Consequently, experts on social media are calling for some pretty wild price targets for XRP if the bull run kicks back into gear. Other market factors, like the possibility of an XRP ETF, are also bound to come into play in the quest for a price rally. Crypto Analysts Remain Bullish On XRP Despite Price Consolidation XRP has been on price decline since the beginning of the year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $0.5375, down 14% from the $0.625 level in early January. Notably, price movement recently went on a surge at the beginning of February as the broader cryptocurrency market witnessed inflows spearheaded by Bitcoin. As a result, XRP climbed to the $0.57 price level on February 15.  Related Reading: Fundstrat Exec Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $150,000, Here’s When Despite the ongoing consolidation and lackluster price action, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has predicted a $1.4 XRP price target in the coming months. The analyst, known for his strong positive stance on XRP, made this prediction while looking at the wicking, ranging, consolidation, and bullish stages of XRP. According to a color-coded price chart shared on social media by EGRAG, XRP is currently in the wicking stage. XRP recently closed above a long-term support level of $0.5141 at the top end of the red flag stage. Consequently, we could see XRP passing through into the bullish stage and $1.4 in the coming months.  It&#8217;s worth noting that the $1.4 price point coincides with a 1.618 Fib extension from $0.3536. EGRAG had noted in the past that XRP reaching $1.4 would set the stage for a progression to $5. Related Reading: Elliot Wave Theory Predicts Bitcoin Bottom And Top, Here Are The Targets Dark Defender, another crypto analyst, used the wave strategy to predict various bullish price points. According to a social media post, XRP could continue the current downturn until it reaches the end point of a wave 2 correction between $0.5198 and $0.5066. Subsequent waves 3, 4, and 5 formations would then see XRP tearing past  $0.6649, $0.7707, and $0.9191. Analyst Dr. Profit also noted the potential of inflows rushing into XRP in the next 30 to 60 days. The analyst divulged that he bought 500,000 recently while calling XRP the &#8220;next shining bull.&#8221; In the spirit of bullish countenance, a popular Bitcoin day trader recently disclosed that his father sold his house for $800,000 and allocated the proceeds to purchase XRP. Although this might seem very daring and unbelievable, it emphasizes the vast amount of optimism among some XRP investors.
