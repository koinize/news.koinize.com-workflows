Ethereum trimmed all gains and now trading near the $1,630 level. The price is trading below $1,660 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 and $1,665 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum managed to recover and stay above the $1,620 pivot level.
