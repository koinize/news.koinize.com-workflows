The short-term moving average (SMA), previously acting as support around the $2 mark, has flipped to resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped below the neutral line, suggesting a dominant downward trend, albeit a weak one. Despite the decline, signs of resilience emerge. The token experienced a slight recovery of 0.2%, currently trading around $1.88. Additionally, the Funding Rate on derivatives platforms like Coinglass remains positive at 0.014%, indicating that buyers still hold some control, albeit with less aggressiveness compared to before. ARBUSD trading at $1.77 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com Low Derivative Interest: A Point Of Caution However, the derivative market paints a less optimistic picture. Open Interest, a metric reflecting the total amount of capital locked in futures contracts, stands at around $254 million, indicating relatively low interest in ARB compared to other tokens. This lack of engagement could potentially limit upward momentum and price stability. Long-Term Prospects Remain Promising Despite the recent price dip, Arbitrum boasts strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Its fast and affordable transactions, coupled with growing developer adoption and ecosystem development, continue to attract interest. Recent partnerships like ApeCoin&#8217;s ApeChain launch on Arbitrum further solidify its position as a leading Layer 2 solution.
