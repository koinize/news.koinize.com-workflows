    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-gears-upswing-soon-crypto-analyst/",
    "description": "The XRP price fell sharply yesterday as a result of Bitcoin&#8217;s flash crash, as did the entire altcoin market. The price briefly fell by 21% yesterday, plummeting from around $0.64 to $0.505. Although the price was still able to recover above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in the 1-day chart at $0.5712 by daily close, it is still down around 10% compared to yesterday&#8217;s high. Nevertheless, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto remains bullish and was able to take some good out of yesterday&#8217;s crash. In his latest analysis of the 1-day XRP/USD chart, Egrag highlighted that the XRP price is in a preparation phase for an upswing. Egrag&#8217;s chart presented on X provides insights into the XRP&#8217;s current position and potential future movements. XRP Price Gearing Up For An Upswing Soon? Egrag&#8217;s analysis starts by revisiting the August scenario where XRP touched the lower boundary of its ascending channel amidst a massive liquidation in the crypto space amounting to $1 billion. Fast-forwarding to the present, XRP is once again at this critical juncture with a similar scale of liquidation occurring yesterday. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: Analyst Envisions Potential 50X Surge To $14, Here’s Why “Now, after five months, it&#8217;s revisiting that zone with another aggressive $1 billion liquidation,” Egrag notes. Remarkably, the XRP bulls defended once again the lower trendline of the ascending channel which was established in May last year. The XRP bulls&#8216; steadfast buying represents a strong bullish signal, particularly as they have maintained the price above the so-called &#8220;Val Hell Line&#8221; at approximately $0.55. Egrag identified this line as the most crucial support line. A fall below this level with the daily candle close could have signaled the beginning of a downward trend. But despite the market&#8217;s upheaval, Egrag highlights the bullish sentiment by noting, &#8220;Surprisingly, the XRP bulls have staunchly defended this channel, buying into the dip as if there&#8217;s no stopping them.&#8221; Related Reading: Researcher Decodes Link Between XRP Price And Ripple’s Buybacks Moreover, Egrag emphasized that another retest was pretty &#8220;standard market behavior&#8221; within the broader context. He views this retest as a potential consolidation phase, potentially building up to an upswing. &#8220;The bulls managed to triumph over the Val Hell Line, avoiding a daily candle close below it,&#8221; Egrag remarked. Price Levels To Watch Egrag&#8217;s chart also features Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly highlighting the 0.702 level at about $1.1096 and the 0.5 level at approximately $0.7529. Traders traditionally use these levels to gauge potential support and resistance zones, and Egrag&#8217;s chart indicates that these levels are important to monitor for the XRP price action. The 0.702 Fib level could remarkably coincide with a breakout from the trend channel if the price reaches the level between April and May. In conclusion, the crypto analyst confidently states, &#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m increasingly confident that we&#8217;re gearing up for a significant upswing very soon. #XRPArmy, keeping an eye on the broader channel perspective keeps me calm and steady, cool and ready.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5791.
