    "description": "<p>Bitcoin miners have raked in an impressive revenue of $184 million in the second quarter of 2023, breaking previous records.&nbsp;</p>\nBRC-20 And Ordinals Boon For Miners\n<p>The second quarter of 2023 has been particularly profitable for Bitcoin miners everywhere. It has brought with it a significant surge in profits, earning them a staggering total revenue of $184 million. Crypto analysts have attributed the million-dollar windfall to the popularity and rising demand for BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals. Coinmetrics pointed out that previously the fee market for Bitcoin miners used to be rather uneventful. However, the market has turned itself around and has raked in significant transaction fees for Bitcoin miners from April to June, with the latest transaction fee total being more than that of the five previous quarters combined.&nbsp;</p>\nWhat Is Ordinals Protocol?&nbsp;\n<p>The Ordinals protocol was launched in early 2023, and despite some pushback from the crypto community has enabled people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual &lsquo;satoshi.&rsquo; (1 satoshi = 1/100,000,000 BTC; and is the smallest unit a BTC can be broken down to).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Its popularity got a boost when MicroStrategy co-founder and major Bitcoin proponent pointed out the protocol&rsquo;s role in raking in profits for BTC miners.&nbsp;</p>\nTransaction Fee Surge Due To BRC-20\n<p>The BRC-20 tokens were inspired by Etheruem&rsquo;s ERC-20 tokens and have blown up to reach over $240 million in market capitalization since its launch in March. To mint these tokens, users must submit a transaction accompanied by a fee. This transaction initiates the process of minting tokens on Bitcoin's network and ensures their inclusion in the subsequent block of transactions.</p>\n<p>Soon after their launch, these tokens invoked a new surge of excitement in May, as more and more people chose to pay higher fees to expedite their transactions. This pushed up BTC&rsquo;s transaction fees in May, leading to speculation that the network was under attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor Technologies, said,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;BRC-20s introduced this urgency because what you needed to do was get your transactions confirmed faster than other peoples&rsquo; transactions. Then you would basically win the coins from the mint.&rdquo;</p>\n\nMiners Continue To Profit\n<p>Notably, the revenue earned by Bitcoin miners from transaction fees surpassed the block subsidy for the first time since 2017, indicating the substantial impact of these fees on miners' earnings.</p>\n<p>However, the enthusiasm surrounding BRC-20 tokens has subsided, leading to a decline in payout amounts associated with transaction fees. Despite the diminished fervor, miners continue to receive substantial funds from transaction fees, especially when compared to previous years.</p>\n<p>Hansen pointed out,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have calmed down, but we're still seeing persistent demand for Bitcoin block space. Miners are still making 10 to 15 times more from their transaction fee volume than they would have last year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
