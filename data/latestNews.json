After the Taproot upgrade in 2021, Bitcoin users discovered that the upgrade allowed them to embed data into the “witness” field of a transaction, allowing images, tokens and other types of digital collectibles to be minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Some users saw the new collectibles as a benefit to the network, while others <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-put-digital-graffiti-bitcoin-blockchain\">regarded them as “spam.”</a></p><p>But the craze didn’t stop with Bitcoin. Soon, inscription producers started minting them on Ethereum sidechains and layer-2s such as Arbitrum, Avalanche and Polygon. Instead of being written into the witness field of a Bitcoin transaction, this new type of inscription was written into the “calldata” field of an EVM-based network. Since calldata doesn’t get stored in a smart contract’s state, this allowed producers to create their collectibles at a fraction of the cost of minting a traditional nonfungible token (NFT).</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-co-founder-explains-how-stop-inscriptions-crashing-networks\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "According to a recent report by Messari, smart contract platform Algorand (ALGO), showcased notable growth and outperformed the general crypto market during the fourth quarter of 2023. Algorand Outperforms Crypto Market Growth  Per the report, Algorand experienced a surge in market capitalization during Q4 2023, with a significant growth rate of 123%. This substantial increase can be attributed to the overall positive momentum of the crypto market, which witnessed a 53% growth in market capitalization during the same period.  Transactions on the Algorand network also saw a significant uptick, increasing by 58% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Consequently, fee revenue rose by 60%, reaching its highest level in a year when measured in ALGO terms, while revenue in USD terms surged by an impressive 143%. Related Reading: More Pain To Come: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive XRP Crash To $0.34 According to Messari, Algorand&#8217;s success can be attributed to its “thriving” ecosystem, which saw the launch of multiple innovative applications in Q4 2023. These applications covered diverse areas such as regulated and programmable euro, tokenized farmland, and a developer marketplace for selling code snippets.  The introduction of these applications further solidified Algorand&#8217;s position as a “dynamic and versatile” platform, attracting users from various domains, according to the report.  Moreover, Algorand witnessed a substantial increase in user adoption during Q4 2023, with the addition of 1.9 million new addresses, representing a 72% QoQ growth.  The platform also experienced a surge in transaction volume, with transactions surpassing 5.5 million towards the end of the quarter, marking the highest number recorded in the past year. Notably, ALGO transactions increased by 43% QoQ.  Messari further suggests that the rise in transactions can be attributed to the popularity of sticky applications like Lofty.ai, which boasted over 7,000 monthly active users, and TravelX, which issued over 2 million NFT plane tickets, with over 1 million issued in Q4 alone. Decrease In Staked ALGO Despite growth in key metrics, the report highlighted a decline in the amount of staked ALGO during Q4, with a 49% year-on-year (YoY) decrease. Messari attributed this decline to the reduction in rewards per governance period.  The diminishing rewards indicate a preference among users to utilize the native asset for transactions rather than committing it to governance. This is further supported by the notable 58% QoQ increase in transactions on the Algorand network. Similarly, Algorand&#8217;s stablecoin market cap experienced a steady decline throughout the year, with a QoQ decrease of 43% and a YoY decrease of 74%.  Notably, Tether’s USDT stablecoin experienced a more severe fall on Algorand, with over $100 million withdrawn in Q3. However, Quantoz launched EURD on Algorand, issuing over 1 million euro-backed tokens in Q4, contributing to 1.4% of the stablecoin market cap on the platform. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Breaks Down XRP Distribution And Who Controlled 99% Of Supply At Genesis Despite previous declines, Algorand&#8217;s decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) witnessed a significant growth of 109% in Q4 2023.  The platform&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem rebounded from a recent downturn, reaching its second-highest level in the past year, with a 12% YoY increase. Notably, Folks Finance experienced substantial growth, doubling its market share value from 55% to 58%, while Pact and Tinyman accounted for approximately 14% of each of the DeFi TVL market share in Q4. As of the latest update, the ALGO token is currently trading at $0.1753. It has experienced significant declines across various time frames, with notable decreases of 8.7%, 12.4%, and 18.5% in the past fourteen days, thirty days, and one year, respectively.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

    "description": "Franklin Templeton President and CEO Jenny Johnson joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the firm’s spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) offering in the US. In this interview, Johnson shared the reasons for investing in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Trillion-Dollar Franklin Templeton Shares High Praise For Solana, Is A SOL ETF Coming? What Made Franklin Templeton CEO A Bitcoin Believer As she states in the interview, the CEO is known for saying that “Bitcoin is the greatest distraction from one of the greatest disruptions in financial services,” which has led many people to believe that she doesn’t support or believe in the crypto asset. Contrary to this belief, she points out that the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) launch shows the asset manager company’s belief in BTC and blockchain technology. Johnson cites the security that Bitcoin provides as one of the reasons that made her a “believer.” Holding and managing your private keys, which she states doing at one point, gives the asset what she labels an “insurance or safety component.” This component makes crypto investors trust Bitcoin more since there’s a “fear component” linked to traditional assets, as she explains: One of the things that made me a believer is: as I went around the world talking to people who would tell you ‘I keep 50% of my savings in Bitcoin because if I save the wrong thing in my country, I could have my assets confiscated.’ I remember talking to somebody in Israel who said, ‘My parents and their parents had all of their assets confiscated’ and they keep a portion in Bitcoin. So, there’s a fear component to it that it’s considered almost an insurance or safety component. The CEO also listed the importance of Bitcoin in “fueling what is the next real opportunity in this blockchain world,” another reason for her to believe in the asset. Trust In Blockchain Technology Regarding the reason behind the market’s demand that led to the spot Bitcoin ETF’s approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the CEO thinks that there are various reasons for it, including Bitcoin’s crucial role, “from a blockchain standpoint,” in the ability to pay. Johnson further explained that blockchain technology will “open a lot of really interesting tech investment opportunities,” as Bitcoin is “one of the suitable opportunities here.” Furthermore, the CEO recalled the asset manager&#8217;s previous use and trust in blockchain technology: We actually launched and tokenized money market fund. We’re the first mutual fund or the first traditional asset manager to actually launch a 40-act fund on a public blockchain, on the stellar blockchain. Lastly, when asked what can allure a traditional investor to invest in an ETF, she explains there’s a market and use case for both. But while holding your keys can be ideal for many, it may also be complicated to figure out. ETFs can better fit some investors who want to diversify their portfolio while “being able to open it up, have access through an ETF, and simply through your account.” Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Makes Waves: Volumes Surge $10 Billion 3 Days Bitcoin is trading at $40,990.5 on the hourly chart.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-meme-coins-sol/",
    "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Solana has emerged as a prominent player, and within its ecosystem, meme coins are creating a buzz in the crypto community. Meme coin trading, with its inherent thrill of pump-and-dump scenarios, has gained momentum on Solana, driven by a surge in liquidity and recent airdrops that have propelled SOL prices.  People who got the Pyth airdrop, the Jito airdrop, and the BONK airdrop need a place to dump and trade their free money, and Solana meme coins have given them the perfect avenue to do so.  This comprehensive guide aims to walk you through the intricate process of acquiring SOL and navigating the exciting world of Solana meme coin trades, emphasizing key considerations for successful and profitable transactions. With the likes of Dog Wif Hat (WIF), Myro (MYRO), and a Bonk (BONK) making waves in the meme coin space, knowing how to get into these coins early on is important. So here is a guide on how to buy and sell meme coins on the Solana network. Understanding The Landscape Of Meme Coins Before delving into the specifics, let&#8217;s briefly understand the unique landscape of meme coin trading on Solana. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with established utilities and roadmaps, meme coins often lack such fundamentals. Don&#8217;t expect a life-changing technology that is supposed to change the crypto game.  Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why These meme coins thrive on community-driven speculation, making them a double-edged sword for traders – an opportunity for exhilarating gains or potential losses. It&#8217;s a game of rug, loss, or victory. The moment you start trading, you either make a profit or you lose.  Acquiring SOL for Meme Coin Trades For those new to Solana meme coin trading, the journey begins with acquiring SOL, Solana&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. Popular exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, and Bybit offer a gateway to obtain SOL.  Once secured, the next step is transferring it to a compatible Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet, such as Phantom Wallet. You can add the wallet to your computer’s browser as an extension or download the app directly to your device. The SOL price has been trading pretty high since trading activities have been increasing, thanks to the meme coin trading. The last bull run saw the SOL price increase driven by an increase in NFT trading; this time around, it’s meme coins. Related Reading: The Crypto Bulls Are Back: Digital Asset Inflows Cross $103 Million In One Week Identifying Profitable Meme Coins With SOL in your Phantom wallet, the focus shifts to identifying promising meme coins. Platforms like Solana Dexscreener become invaluable, allowing you to track meme coins specifically on the Solana chain.  Look for meme coins with lower market caps – an indicator that can significantly amplify profits during pump phases. Their names sometimes help, as meme coins with controversial names also help boost the chances of increasing the price or attracting people into trading them.  Navigating Social Signals To Buy Good Coins On Solana Beyond market cap considerations, a crucial aspect of meme coin trading is community engagement. A vibrant community can drive trading activity, contributing to a coin&#8217;s success. Check X (formerly Twitter) and other social platforms for discussions around the meme coin of interest.  An active community that posts updates and engages with its audience adds credibility to the project. People get more excited and motivated when they keep seeing people talk about them, this is where the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Opportunity) comes into play.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Millionaires Rise By 246% In 2023, Here’s How Many There Are Guarding Against Rug Pulls On Solana Network While pump and dump dynamics are inherent in meme coin trading, the specter of rug pulls adds an extra layer of risk. A rug pull occurs when the creators of a meme coin remove liquidity, rendering the coin untradable and leaving investors with a worthless asset. Rug pulls often go undetected until they happen, making due diligence crucial when selecting meme coins for trading. You can never be too careful about them, this is why it&#8217;s advisable to trade with what you can afford to lose. Additionally, there are scanners that provide some layer of security for investors by carrying out a rudimentary rug pull check. They check for common features of rug pull and honey pot contracts such as the inability to sell after buying, high taxes on transactions, etc. Examples of these tools include the Smart Contract Scanner by De.Fi. Choosing the Right Solana DEX The Solana ecosystem boasts various decentralized exchanges, each with its unique features. Jupiter Exchange, Raydium, Birdeye, and Orca are among the prominent options. Platforms like Birdeye also provide charting capabilities, simplifying the decision-making process for traders.  Some of the charts make trading meme coins easier as they have the contract addresses of the meme coins, but to be sure, it is advisable to check their Twitter because they can be fake copies of these meme coins that might want to take advantage of the meme coin hype and rug.  Related Reading: Billionaire Tim Draper Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $250,000 Executing Your First Solana Meme Coin Trade With SOL secured in your phantom wallet and a meme coin identified, it&#8217;s time to execute your first trade. Obtaining the contract address from the meme coin&#8217;s Twitter page is an essential step in the trading process.  Connect your Phantom wallet to the chosen Solana DEX, input the contract address where you are supposed to swap for SOL, and initiate the swap, converting SOL to the selected meme coin. Alternatively, utilize Dexscreener to locate the &#8220;Trade On X&#8221; icon, where &#8220;X&#8221; represents the DEX for the Solana meme coin. A click directs you to a tab where the contract address is pre-filled, streamlining the trading process.  This makes it easier to trade, and saves you time, should, in case, you want to trade at launch to catch the best prices.  Related Reading: Harmony To See Redemption? Analyst Predicts Meteoric 650% Rise For ONE Token Risk Management And Future Trades Prudent risk management is essential in meme coin trading. Avoiding the &#8220;MAX&#8221; button ensures you retain SOL for transaction fees during future trades. Consider allocating a portion of your SOL rather than risking the entire amount, providing flexibility for subsequent transactions. Remember to always trade with what you can afford to lose, so you don&#8217;t lose all your money. Monitoring And Expanding Your Solana Portfolio Congratulations, you&#8217;ve completed your first Solana meme coin trade! Now, whether you choose to monitor the chart for price progress or explore additional meme coin opportunities on Dexscreener, stay informed.  Analyze trading activity, distinguishing between buying and selling actions – greens for buying, reds for selling. This analysis aids in making informed decisions, allowing you to stay ahead in the dynamic world of meme coin trading. Conclusion In conclusion, navigating the realm of Solana meme coin trading requires a blend of market awareness, community engagement, and strategic decision-making. By understanding the fundamentals, conducting thorough research, and implementing sound risk management practices, you can unlock the potential for profitable meme coin trades on the Solana blockchain.

    "description": "XRP is currently at a critical juncture, as crypto analyst CoinsKid has pointed out. The analyst has raised concerns about the altcoin&#8217;s immediate future and emphasizes the urgent need for bullish momentum to prevent a significant downturn. Bulls Should Step In Quick In the post shared on X, CoinsKid stressed that if the bulls don&#8217;t step in soon, XRP could face a drastic &#8220;macro correction,&#8221; potentially plummeting its price toward the $0.38 level. This warning follows a period of declining prices for XRP, which has seen the asset struggle to maintain its value. Related Reading: More Pain To Come: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive XRP Crash To $0.34 The analyst elaborated, &#8220;Squeaky bum time. TICK TOCK,&#8221; highlighting the urgency and the nervous anticipation surrounding XRP&#8217;s price movement in the coming days. This sentiment reflects a broader concern among XRP investors and market observers. The lack of bullish activity in the recent period has left XRP vulnerable to further losses, raising fears that it could slide to its lowest levels in months. The potential drop to $0.38 would represent a loss in value and mark a new phase of uncertainty for the cryptocurrency. This comes when the broader crypto market is experiencing its own challenges, with various assets facing downward pressure. We need to see the bulls step in here for #xrp. Otherwise, we could see a bigger macro correction play out towards the 0.786 at $0.38 Squeaky bum time. TICK TOCK pic.twitter.com/jKlBsiXu6h — CoinsKid (@Coins_Kid) January 19, 2024 XRP Price Action And Bearish Confirmation XRP&#8217;s recent market performance has been far from reassuring for its holders. Over the past week, the asset has seen a decline of more than 10%, and so far, this bearish trend shows no signs of abating. The altcoin is trading below $0.53, a drop of nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. This downward trajectory is further corroborated by crypto analyst Ali, who has pointed out that should XRP breach the $0.55 level, the altcoin could tumble down to as low as $0.34. Such a drop would take the altcoin to a price point not seen since April 2023, an alarming prospect for investors and the XRP community. $XRP is currently grappling to maintain its footing at the crucial $0.55 support level. Should this support fail to hold, be prepared for a possible sell-off scenario that could see #XRP descending toward $0.34! pic.twitter.com/6oKObjpnnm — Ali (@ali_charts) January 18, 2024 Despite this downturn, XRP&#8217;s daily trading volume has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion over the past week. At the time of writing, Altcoin&#8217;s trading volume was around $1.28 billion. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from Tradingview"

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-usdt-tether-8888-btc/",
    "description": "In an encouraging development for the crypto space, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has doubled down on its Bitcoin investment momentum by acquiring a staggering 8,888 BTC, further diversifying its portfolio.  Tether Increases Its Bitcoin Holdings Tether has recently made its third largest Bitcoin purchase, as the stablecoin issuer added a total of 8,888 BTC valued at $380 million at the time of purchase. This brings its total BTC holdings to 66,465 BTC, valued at $2.81 billion with an average buy price of $42,353.  Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin Price Fall Below $41,000? This transaction was captured by BitInfoCharts data, which also showed the previous amounts of BTC accumulated by the blockchain-enabled platform. This recent purchase follows Tether’s Bitcoin investment strategy, in line with its vision to continuously strengthen its reserves by accumulating Bitcoin. Earlier in May 2023, the stablecoin issuer announced in a blog post that it would regularly allocate 15% of its net realized operating profits toward increasing its BTC reserves. As of the end of March 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency, a $1.3 billion difference from its total BTC holdings presently.  According to reports from Dune Analytics, Tether has become the 11th largest Bitcoin holder, with Microstrategy, an American business intelligence service, surpassing Tether’s holdings with over 189,00 BTC accumulated. The other addresses in the top 10 rankings are owned by major crypto exchanges and governments, including Binance, Bitfinex and the US government.  Tether’s decision to double down on its Bitcoin investments signals its confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. It also underscores the blockchain platform’s belief in the long-term potential of BTC as it aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential growth by bolstering and diversifying its digital asset reserve.   BTC price sitting at $41,354 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Accumulation Race Amidst ETF Hype Tether’s strategic Bitcoin purchase comes at a time when the crypto market is buzzing with excitement over Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Before the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Tether had steadily increased its BTC portfolio, purchasing substantial quantities of BTC consistently. In March 2023, the stablecoin issuer bought 15,915 BTC and another 4,083 BTC between the months of May and September. Related Reading: $245 Million Whale Wakes Up To Threaten XRP Price Recovery The timing of Tether’s BTC purchase suggests a proactive stance towards potentially seizing the opportunities brought forth by the Spot Bitcoin ETF market and the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April. In addition to Tether’s large-scale BTC acquisition, Microstrategy is also another major player which has been continually increasing its BTC holdings. The business intelligence software company added a whopping 14,620 BTC to its portfolio in December 2023. At the time, the value of the purchase was about $615.7 million.  Other companies with large BTC holdings include Galaxy Digital and Elon Musk’s Tesla, as well as space exploration company SpaceX.

    "description": "Recently, cryptocurrency analytics platform Lookonchain reported activities of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales amid the ongoing market downturn. These whales appear to have been capitalizing on the recent decline in the crypto prices to bolster their holdings. According to Lookonchain, amid the market dip, a newly established wallet withdrew 700 BTC, valued at roughly $29.36 million, from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin Price Fall Below $41,000?

Lookonchain’s subsequent tweet highlighted similar activities in the Ethereum market. A whale took advantage of the decreased Ethereum prices, buying 3,600 ETH, worth around $8.9 million. Lookonchain highlighted that this investor’s history of buying ETH at lower prices and selling at higher valuations has resulted in substantial profits, estimated at around $25.8 million. After the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago. This whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs. The profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024 These whale movements are worth noting, especially considering the increasing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum, for instance, has seen a 1.9% decline in the past 24 hours and a 7.8% drop over the past week. The asset is currently trading at around $2,475. Bitcoin is experiencing a similar trend, with a nearly 3% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 10% fall over the past week, bringing its price to $40,819 at the time of writing. This market downturn is also reflected in the asset&#8217;s trading volume. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume fell from over $40 billion last Friday to about $26 billion. Bitcoin Market Analysis And Future Predictions In light of these developments, renowned crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has cautioned that Bitcoin might face further corrections in the short term. Canfield notes that the upcoming Bitcoin halving could play a crucial role in rebalancing the market dynamics, potentially tipping the scale towards demand over supply. However, his analysis of Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart indicates the formation of a trend that has historically been an indicator of negative short to mid-term price movements. For Bitcoin, critical levels include $48,700, marked by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, weekly resistance, and a significant support level to watch at $38,700. Earlier this month, Bitcoin traded at the $48,700 zone before retracing.

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has experienced a sharp drop below the $41,000 mark as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin went live on January 12.  The subsequent profit-taking, selling pressure, and outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) played a significant role in the downward trend. Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Transfers To Coinbase Intensify On Tuesday, NewsBTC reported that six days ago, Grayscale initiated the first batch of BTC outflows from their holdings to a Coinbase, totaling 4,000 BTC (approximately $183 million) over six days.  However, the asset manager resumed outflows from the Trust to the exchange on Tuesday, sending an additional 11,700 BTC (equivalent to $491.4 million) to Coinbase.  Related Reading: Cardano To $7? Analyst Predicts When ADA Will Resume Uptrend Furthermore, on Friday, data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that 12,865 BTC ($529 million) were transferred from the Grayscale Trust address to Coinbase Prime.  In total, the Grayscale Trust address has transferred 54,343 BTC ($2.313 billion) to Coinbase Prime during the opening hours of the US stock market over five consecutive trading days since January 12, which has undoubtedly contributed to the downtrend in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Selling Frenzy Among BTC Miners In addition to Grayscale&#8217;s selling spree, there has been increased selling activity by Bitcoin miners ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.  Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights that on-chain data from CryptoQuant indicates a substantial increase in selling activity by BTC miners. In the past 24 hours, miners offloaded nearly 10,600 BTC, with a value of approximately $455.8 million. The persistent selling pressure has caused BTC to trade at $40,900, reflecting a slight 0.2% decrease over the past 24 hours.  The downtrend has been evident across various time frames, with declines of 5%, 6%, and 7% over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, respectively. However, despite these recent setbacks, Bitcoin remains remarkably positive year-to-date, with an impressive 98% gain. Related Reading: More Pain To Come: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive XRP Crash To $0.34 Overall, the combined impact of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust ETF outflows and increased selling activity by miners has intensified the downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price, breaching the critical support level of $41,000.  The focus now turns to how Bitcoin bulls will defend the crucial $40,000 support level, which stands as the last line of defense before a potential dip toward the $37,700 mark. Should this support level fail to hold, the Bitcoin market could witness further price declines, potentially pushing the price down to the $35,800 mark. However, with the Bitcoin halving scheduled for April, bullish investors are hopeful that this event will catalyze a significant bull run.
