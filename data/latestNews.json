It was first launched in 2019. In March, the Polygon team <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-s-holy-grail-ethereum-scaling-zkevm-beta-hits-mainnet\">launched a second network</a>, Polygon zkEVM, that uses zero-knowledge proof rollups to scale Ethereum.</p><p>In the June 20 post, Bjelic proposed to also upgrade the old PoS network to a zkEVM version, making both networks rely on zero-knowledge proofs. However, unlike the network that just launched in March, the new version of Polygon PoS will not be a “rollup,” Bjelic stated. In other words, it will not store compressed transaction data on Ethereum. Instead, it will be a “validium” that stores only validation proofs on layer 1, while the actual transaction data will be kept on a separate chain.</p><p>This compromise will allow Polygon PoS to have lower transaction fees than Polygon zkEVM. It will also increase the security of Polygon PoS, since it will allow the network to inherit Ethereum’s security, the co-founder concluded.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/zk-rollups-need-data-availability-says-polygon-co-founder\"><strong>Why ZK-rollups need data availability</strong></a></p><p>Once the upgrade is implemented, Polygon zkEVM may be used for high-value transactions where security is of the utmost importance, whereas Polygon PoS may become the network for gaming and social media enthusiasts, Bjelic suggested, stating:</p><blockquote>“Upgraded Polygon PoS (zkEVM validium) would offer very high scalability and very low fees, with the tradeoff of storing transaction data locally instead of on Ethereum. It would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees, e.g. Web3 gaming and social.”</blockquote><p>The Polygon co-founder offered a timeline for when he thought the upgrade could be implemented, stating that his informal proposal could be turned into a formal Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) by November and implemented on mainnet sometime between February and March, 2024.</p><p>The launch of Polygon zkEVM and upgrading of Polygon PoS is part of a grand plan by the team to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-2-0-introduces-upgrades-to-tap-into-value-layer-of-internet\">create a “Supernet”</a> uniting many different application-specific chains.

On spot BTCUSD charts, Bitcoin has a little more to climb. However, the breakout on the BTC1 continuous contract chart could be a prelude of what’s to come.

Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation Bitcoin escaping the Ichimoku cloud was a crucial breach of dynamic resistance. In the comparison above, BTC leaving the cloud in 2020 led to the most recent bullish rally in crypto. In 2021 after the second top at $68,000 per coin, Bitcoin then retested the cloud and fell right through it. This time, not only did the retest hold, but today’s rally just pushed BTC CME Futures daily chart above the cloud, the Tenkan-sen, and the Kijun-sen. This means that according to the Ichimoku, there is very little daily resistance left. If Bitcoin does behave like the last time it left the cloud, it could be time for liftoff.

This new milestone meant that the total number of LTC addresses has now surpassed that of Ethereum’s 180 million. However, it is still a long way from its biggest rival Bitcoin, which currently boasts over 1 billion total addresses. Related Reading: Best Crypto Narrative For This Summer?

LTC price trending at 76.12 ahead of halving &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com LTC Halving Could See Price Soar The Litecoin halving is an event that sees the block reward for miners on the network cut down in half. It works just like Bitcoin in this way as it happens every four years, and creates an environment of scarcity for the cryptocurrency. This is why the halving can be a bullish event for the digital asset. LTC’s next halving is taking place approximately 44 days from now at a block height of 2,520,000. This halving reward will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, and a block is produced on Litecoin approximately every two-and-a-half minutes. LTC halving happening at block height 2,520,000 &#124; Source: NiceHash As the block rewards are set to be cut in half, investors are flocking to the digital asset in hopes that the halving will trigger a rally.

Presently, LTC is trading at $76 apiece but as bullish sentiment rises leading up to the event, the cryptocurrency could easily cross the $100 mark.
