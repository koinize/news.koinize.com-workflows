    "description": "The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the altcoins that have recently surged into the mid-term &#8220;opportunity zone.&#8221; These Altcoins May Be More Likely To See Rebounds In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed what the various altcoins in the market are looking like from the perspective of the MVRV. The &#8220;Market Value To Realized Value&#8221; (MVRV) refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model for BTC that measures the total sum of capital that the investors have used to purchase their coins. As such, the MVRV tells us about how the value that the investors are holding right now (the market cap) compares against this initial investment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges Under $63,000, Here’s Where Next On-Chain Support Is Historically, the more profits the investors have held (that is, the higher the market cap has been compared to the realized cap), the more likely tops have been to occur. This is naturally because investors become more likely to give in to the allure of profit-taking the higher their gains get. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies have been probable to see rebounds when holders&#8217; returns have dropped into the negative territory. In these conditions, there aren&#8217;t many profit-takers left, so selling pressure begins to run out. Based on these facts, Santiment has come up with an &#8220;Opportunity &#38; Danger Zone Model&#8221; that uses the MVRV&#8217;s divergence from the norm on various timeframes to determine if an asset is providing a potential window for selling or buying right now. Below is the chart shared by the on-chain analytics firm that reveals what this model is saying for altcoins around the sector: Looks like some of the coins are approaching the opportunity zone &#124; Source: Santiment on X From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that a lot of coins are still inside the overbought territory, but several altcoins have managed to sneak into the mid-term opportunity zone following the recent market downturn led by Bitcoin&#8217;s plunge. &#8220;This zone gets breached when an asset&#8217;s 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns are combining to be in negative territory,&#8221; explains Santiment. It should be noted, though, that while mid-term returns are red for these coins, they are still not yet inside the buy zone proper. &#8220;In a zero sum game like crypto, projects with minimal returns compared to the rest of the sector have a higher probability of a more efficient rebound for those who are willing to #buythedip on projects traders are in the most pain on,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Undergone This Bearish Structure Change, Analyst Explains According to Santiment, some of the best altcoin candidates who are inside the mid-term opportunity zone include Lido DAO (LDO), Synthetix (SNX), Storj (STORJ), and OMG Network (OMG). LDO Price Lido DAO has had a bad time recently as its price has gone down more than 31% over the past week. With these red returns, it&#8217;s no wonder that the coin is becoming underbought on the MVRV. The price of the altcoin appears to have plunged down in the last few days &#124; Source: LDOUSD on TradingView Featured image from Shutterstock.com, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com"
