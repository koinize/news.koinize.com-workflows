    "description": "Bitcoin price is consolidating losses below the $26,500 level. BTC is showing bearish signs and remains at risk of a fresh decline toward $25,000. Bitcoin is struggling to recover above the $26,600 resistance zone. The price is trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support near $26,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down and trade below the $26,000 support. Bitcoin Price Turns Red Bitcoin price started a recovery wave from the $24,800 support zone. BTC managed to recover above the $25,000 and $25,500 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $29,180 swing high to the $24,800 low. However, the price is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near $26,600. It is still trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support near $26,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If Bitcoin stays above the trend line, it could attempt a recovery wave. Immediate resistance is near the $26,400 level. The next major resistance is near $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. A clear move above the 100 hourly Simple moving average could start a recovery wave toward the $27,000 resistance.

A close above the $27,000 resistance could start a decent increase toward the $27,500 resistance zone. Any more gains might set the pace for a larger increase toward $28,150. Another Decline In BTC?
