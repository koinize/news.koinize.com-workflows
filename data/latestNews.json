    "description": "<p>Fresh on the heels of the latest SEC enforcement actions on Binance and Coinbase the crypto market is seeing a healthy bounce.</p>\nThe grand plan\n<p>This must have been thought out a while ago. First sue Binance, and before the dust even settles, sue Coinbase. It hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but it really wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise if the SEC served Tether with a Wells Notice in the near future.</p>\n<p>All planned to sow fear and distrust among retail investors and scare them out of the crypto market. Of course, cutting off the banks that do business with crypto, getting the main market makers to back off from the sector, and embroiling the big exchanges in expensive litigation are also part of the Operation Choke Point plan.</p>\nCrypto market rebounds\n<p>With all of this as a backdrop, the crypto market has the audacity to start rebounding after yesterday&rsquo;s Binance news and today&rsquo;s similar news for Coinbase.</p>\n<p>Of course, when the Binance news dropped yesterday it came out of the blue and the crypto market did take a hammering. Bitcoin fell fairly precipitously 6.4% on the day, going as low as just under $25,400, from $27,100 at the previous day&rsquo;s close.</p>\n<p>However, even amid today&rsquo;s fresh news of the SEC going after Coinbase, bitcoin has staged a recovery and is up 3.6% so far at time of going to press. Part of the reason for this is that technically, the charts were pointing to a new upsurge for Bitcoin, and the bad news has just caused a blip.</p>\n<p>All the short term time frame Stochastic RSIs have reset at the bottom, and even the daily and the weekly RSIs are on their way down as well. When these all cross up from the bottom the momentum is going to be difficult to stop.</p>\nStrong fundamental cryptos are surging\n<p>The same story is also being played out for many of the more fundamentally sound crypto projects. Ethereum has rebounded 4.4% since yesterday&rsquo;s low point, making back two thirds of the losses so far.</p>\n<p>Hot crypto projects such as decentralised exchange Injective Protocol ($INJ), and decentralised GPU-based rendering solution Render ($RNDR) are both coming back fast, making 4.8% and 5.7% respectively so far today.</p>\nJoke coin has its day\n<p>Even meme coin Pepe ($PEPE) has made a move like Lazarus from the dead, increasing 26% from yesterday&rsquo;s low.</p>\nLet battle commence\n<p>The crypto market is rebounding because it was in the charts. Be that as it may, stand by for more anti-crypto action from the US government and its financial enforcement agencies. The war has only just begun.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "EThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on June 5 that it had sued the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, for alleged securities fraud. The announcement triggered a market crash as BNB’s price and others suffered, and users clamored to remove their crypto from the exchange. $1.5 Billion In Withdrawals In 24 Hours In the 24 hours following the SEC’s announcement, the volume of withdrawals from Binance saw a surge, as expected. According to data from DeFiLlama, Binance’s net flows climbed quickly but with outflows remaining high, it offset all of the inflows as withdrawals dominated its volume. In total, the exchange saw $1.5 billion in crypto assets leave the exchange in the 24-hour period following the SEC announcement. Related Reading: LSD Tokens Rally As Ethereum Staking Ramps Up, Here Are The Leaders On-chain data aggregation firm Nansen also reported on the Binance outflows. The dashboard showed that transfers on the Ethereum blockchain alone on the exchange reached a negative net flow of $778 million on the worldwide platform, while the US arm saw negative net flows of $12,982,964. Outflows reach $1.5 billion &#124; Source: DeFiLlama Trading volume on the exchange has also remained high during this time with $6.24 billion in spot volume in the one-day period. Open interest on the trading platform also climbed to $8.8 billion with an average leverage of 0.17x. Despite the outflows, Binance still remains ahead of the rest of the market with around $50 billion in assets in its reserves. This means that the $1.5 billion in outflows only accounts for less than 3% of the exchange’s total reserves. Can Binance Recover From Here? This is not Binance’s first rodeo when it comes to an event triggering massive outflows from the exchange. In fact, the current outflows remain in the realm of ‘normal’ for the exchange which saw over $2 billion in single-day outflows back in December 2022. Given that the exchange was able to come out of the FTX event unscathed even after investor trust had been eroded greatly, the possibility of it coming out of this unscathed as well remains high given the outflows are lower. CEO Changpeng Zhao has also adopted a new mantra of ‘Ignore FUD’ this year as he has assured users in the past that their funds are safe. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market A recent tweet from Zhao seems to be addressing the SEC coming after the exchange. The SEC which has now sued multiple firms looks to be coming after the crypto industry in general and not just one firm. “If you have to pick a fight with everyone, maybe you are the one at fault,” the CEO said. At the time of writing, Binance’s native token BNB is yet to recover from its Monday crash. The coin is trading at $277.58, down 7.81% in the last 24 hours with losses of 11.30% on the weekly chart.
