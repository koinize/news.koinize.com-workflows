DLT has already led to the emergence of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance, although the track record of these segments has been uneven over the past 18 months.\"</blockquote><p>The report highlights that AI will boost economic growth by increasing productivity through task automation, partially offsetting the effects of aging and shrinking populations in many countries. As for DLT, the benefits include fostering financial inclusion and modernizing payment systems. However, it is unlikely that these benefits will materialize before the next decade.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/2f58502c-5e58-4fa6-8d0e-a4ce9fe37c7e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>How AI and DLT will transform organizations' strategies.
