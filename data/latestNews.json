Thus, these VC firms directly “perpetrated, conspired to perpetrate, and/or aided and abetted the FTX Group’s multi-billion-dollar frauds for their own financial and professional gain.” </p><p>While talking about the role of VC firms in aiding and abating FTX fraud, the plaintiffs cited the example of Temasek and its statement regarding the financial conditions of FTX. Temasek has claimed that they conducted an 8-month-long extensive review of FTX’s finances, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-red-flags-at-ftx-despite-8-months-of-extensive-due-diligence-temasek\">audits and regulatory checks and found no red flags</a>. The suit read:</p><blockquote>“The Multinational VC Defendants also made numerous deceptive and misleading statements of their own about FTX’s business, finances, operations, and prospects for the purpose of inducing customers to invest, trade, and/or deposit assets with FTX. \"</blockquote><p>The suit further alleged that these VC firms vouched for the safety and stability of the FTX and  advertised FTX’s purported attempts to become properly regulated.</p><p>Temasek was one of the early investors in the FTX crypto exchange with a $275 million investment, but, after the collapse of the crypto exchange in November.
