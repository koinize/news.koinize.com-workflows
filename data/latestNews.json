Notably, SOL's price broke above the horizontal trendline resistance of its ascending triangle channel two weeks ago.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/a8317d06-cfab-4ae4-b246-22b37f8b1571.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USD weekly price chart.
