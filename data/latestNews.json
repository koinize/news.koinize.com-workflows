Curiously, the internet is teeming with headlines suggesting the plausibility of such a collapse, whether caused by cyberattacks, physical assaults on infrastructure, equipment malfunctions, or even the notion of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) incapacitating [&#8230;]"

    "description": "Spurred by the recent flood of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from Blackrock and Fidelity among others, Bitcoin vaulted impressively up to the $30,000 area where its momentum has stalled in recent sessions. While many analysts and traders routinely acknowledge the significance of the $30,000 level as a key resistance area, Bitcoin&#8217;s move back above its 20-month simple moving average (20-month SMA) may deserve far more attention than it&#8217;s getting. With Bitcoin poised for a potential major buy signal as soon as July 1st, let’s take a closer look at this underappreciated signal. The Simple Line Separating Bull And Bear Phases Bitcoin&#8217;s 20-month SMA currently sits at $29,910 according to the Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar All Time History Index, slightly below Bitcoin&#8217;s current price of just above $30,000. This puts the number one cryptocurrency by market cap barely above its 20-month SMA for the first time since March 2022. What&#8217;s the potential significance? If Bitcoin can end the month of June with a monthly candle close above the 20-month SMA, this will be only the fifth time that this has occurred in all of Bitcoin&#8217;s history, and a signal which has often seen higher prices follow. Bitcoin Monthly Chart with 20-Month SMA  &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls As Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Intensify For a clearer picture of the significance of the 20-month SMA, let&#8217;s look at all of Bitcoin&#8217;s monthly closes above the 20-month SMA and below the 20-month SMA. In order to do this, we&#8217;ll create a hypothetical trading system, strictly for analytical purposes, &#8220;buying&#8221; when Bitcoin closes above its 20-month SMA and &#8220;selling&#8221; when Bitcoin closes back below its 20-month SMA. Note that “LE” indicates a buy signal while “LX” indicates a sell signal. The blue highlight shows the periods when the system&#8217;s logic sold Bitcoin following a long exit signal and was out of the market. Bitcoin Monthly Chart with 20-Month SMA  &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com What&#8217;s striking in this chart is that 20-month SMA nearly perfectly divides bull phases from bear phases throughout most of Bitcoin’s history from late 2011 to now. For example, exiting once Bitcoin closes below its 20-month SMA sidesteps much of the 2014-2015 bear market, the worst leg down of the 2018-2019 bear market, and so far virtually all of the current 2022-2023 bear market. The early pandemic drop in March of 2020 provides the only exception, with the simple logic getting briefly whipsawed before re-entering at the start of the next month. Bitcoin&#8217;s 20-Month SMA Stats Look Compellingly Bullish Taking our research a step further, let&#8217;s quantify the signals, once again hypothetically &#8220;buying&#8221; when Bitcoin closes above its 20-month SMA and &#8220;selling&#8221; when Bitcoin closes back below its 20-month SMA. From late 2011 to the present, there have been four completed signals with a profitability of 75%, meaning three of the four signals produced a hypothetical gain, and one of the signals produced a loss. Over these four signals, Bitcoin delivered an impressive +2499% hypothetical average trade versus a single worst trade result of -24.8%. While clearly occurrences of these infrequent signals are low (only four to date, and too few to be statistically significant) and the past does not predict the future, we&#8217;ll nevertheless be watching closely to see if Bitcoin can end June with a monthly close above its 20-month SMA. At the moment, sitting just above the key $30,000 level, Bitcoin looks poised for a potential major buy signal in July. DB the Quant is the author of the REKTelligence Report newsletter on Substack.
