    "description": "Crypto.com achieves yet another milestone with its recently acquired license from Dubai&#8217;s regulatory authority to offer services in the country by Dubai&#8217;s arm CRO DAX Middle East FZE. Significance of Crypto.com Recent License According to the announcement, Crypto.com Dubai&#8217;s entity acquired the coveted Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This marks a major step for the firm as it aims to extend its services worldwide. The recently acquired VASP license will enable the firm to completely satisfy selected conditions and localization requirements outlined by VARA. In addition, it will allow the firm to launch operations, upon receiving operational approval notice from the regulatory body. Related Reading: Crypto.com Granted VASP Registration By Spain’s Central Bank Furthermore, it will enable the firm to offer regulated virtual asset service activities in the country. These include exchange services, broker-dealer services, management and investment services, and lending and borrowing services. These services are accessible to retail and institutional users in the market through the Crypto.com Exchange and Crypto.com App. The announcement also saw the company highlighting Dubai as its regional hub for the Middle East and Africa. According to Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, Dubai is one of the top markets for creating effective regulation for the crypto space.  “Dubai continues to show it is a leading market when designing effective regulation for the crypto space while still supporting adoption and innovation,&#8221; the CEO stated. Since VARA released its specialized regulations for virtual assets in February 2023, Crypto.com has been working to be among the first virtual asset exchanges to operationalize its VASP Licence. Finally, the firm&#8217;s aim has been realized. “It is an incredible honor to be one of the first crypto exchanges to be granted a Virtual Asset Service Provider Licence by VARA,” Kris stated. The VASP license is one of the notable licenses acquired by the company this year. In March, Crypto.com also acquired an MVP Preparatory Licence from the Dubai regulatory authority. Latest License Might Propel Cronos (CRO) Price Over the past weeks, Cronos (CRO) has been seen as one of the best-performing coins. CRO experienced an impressive 57% price surge within the seven-day timeframe reaching the $0.1 mark. The token outclassed some major cryptocurrencies in the top 100 ranking over the weekend. However, the crypto asset seems to have lost its momentum, as it fell from $0.1 to $0.088. According to CoinMarketCap, CRO is currently down by over 5% in the past 24 hours.

Nonetheless, as the native token of Crypto.com, the license could spark larger adoption for CRO, which might help CRO regain its momentum.  Featured image from AltcoinsBOX, chart by Tradingview.com"
