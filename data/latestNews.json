This is a gain of approximately $12.6 million over 14 days.</p><p>According to the app’s official documentation, Origin Ether generates yield from Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) by depositing it into multiple liquid staking and DeFi protocols. Specifically, it utilizes an algorithmic market operations (AMO) strategy on Curve and Convex to maximize returns. Before being deposited to Curve and Convex, some of the ETH is converted into liquid staking derivatives, including Lido Staked Ether (stETH), Rocket Ether (rETH), and Frax Staked Ether (sfrxETH). The protocol's documentation stated that this allows users to gain additional farming rewards from these providers.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-784m-steth-in-lidos-long-withdrawal-queue\"><strong>Celsius adds over 428K stETH to Lido’s lengthening withdrawal queue</strong></a></em></p><p>Ether liquid staking protocols allow ETH holders to stake their coins with a network of providers in exchange for tokens representing those deposits. They have become more popular as Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake consensus and enabled withdrawals. </p><p>On May 1, DeFiLlama reported that liquid staking protocols <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/liquid-staking-solutions-now-have-more-tvl-than-dexs-defi-llama\">have become the top DeFi category</a>, surpassing the TVL of decentralized exchanges.

The first was the company’s rapid scaling during its initial years of operation, which “led the organization to taking on surface area that’s not truly part of Nansen’s core strategy.”</p><p>Svanevik also cited a brutal year for crypto markets as the second reason for the layoffs. Despite efforts to diversify revenue streams through enterprise and institutional customers, Nansen’s cost base remained relatively high compared to the company’s current position. He added that although the company has “several years of runway,” its “priority is to build a sustainable business.”</p><p>The CEO said laid-off employees would be entitled to severance packages. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-layoffs-decelerate-with-layoffs-falling-to-570-in-february\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-layoffs-decelerate-with-layoffs-falling-to-570-in-february/amp\">Crypto layoffs decelerate, with layoffs falling to 570 in February</a></em></strong></p><p>Mass layoffs continue to plague the crypto industry, though they have slowed significantly in recent months.
