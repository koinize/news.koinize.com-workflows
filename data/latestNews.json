CEO Jack Dorsey, who <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jack-dorsey-endorse-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy\">has recently thrown his weight behind the candidate</a>. “He can and will,” wrote Dorsey on Twitter about the candidate's strategy to defeat his opponents in the upcoming race. </p><p>Kennedy Jr. is the son of former Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the nephew of the 35th President of the U.S. John F. Kennedy. His support comes at a crucial time for the American crypto industry, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on crypto businesses in the absence of a proper regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\"><strong><em>Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
