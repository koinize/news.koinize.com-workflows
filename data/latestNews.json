One reason is its overbought <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-s-3-ways-the-relative-strength-index-rsi-can-be-used-as-a-sell-signal\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> on the daily chart, which typically prompts the price to drop or consolidate sideways. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/dbce492c-dc47-46f1-b697-1d48d1ed351f.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USD daily price chart.

It happened as traders awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting to understand their position on interest rates. The minutes will release on July 5 at 1400 EDT.</p><p>The market believes Fed officials have discussed raising the benchmark rates two more times in 2023 despite not raising them in the last meeting.

This will involve LTC price testing the lower trendline at around $85 in Q3, down about 15% from current price levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/6e574ee4-1f25-4d65-9d67-253770f09fe6.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LTC/USD weekly price chart.
