    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-analyst-hype-best-2-ai-altcoins/",
    "description": "Two AI-focused projects have recently garnered significant attention: Render Network (RNDR) and Bittensor (TAO). These projects, while distinct in their objectives and execution, are at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Analyst Crypto Stream has analyzed the two most hyped AI projects in this cycle and tried to answer the question: “Which one is the true king of AI coins?” Render Network (RNDR): A Leap In GPU Rendering Crypto Stream highlights that Render Network addresses a critical need in the current digital era: the demand for GPU computing power. Industries ranging from filmmaking to AI research are constantly seeking more computational resources, a need that even major tech giants struggle to meet. Render Network ingeniously tackles this issue by enabling individuals with GPU resources to monetize their idle computing power. As Crypto Stream puts it, &#8220;Render Network is not just optimizing resource utilization but is fundamentally changing the dynamics of GPU computing power accessibility.&#8221; Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Sold The Bitcoin Top Reveals How To Buy And Sell At The Perfect Time The economic model of RNDR has evolved since its inception as an ERC-20 token in 2017. Migrating to the Solana blockchain, the project introduced a burn mechanism, where RNDR tokens equivalent to the fiat value of GPU power purchased are burnt, potentially reducing the token supply over time. &#8220;This burn mechanism,&#8221; Crypto Stream notes, &#8220;is a fascinating aspect of RNDR, adding a deflationary characteristic to its tokenomics.&#8221; Discussing RNDR&#8217;s market performance, Crypto Stream observes that the token&#8217;s peak at over $7 in 2022 and its current price at $3.49 reflect its substantial growth. With a market capitalization of $1.3 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $1.8 billion, RNDR has already experienced a significant 10x increase this year. &#8220;We&#8217;re not early in the game with RNDR, but its potential in the AI space still makes it a project worth watching,&#8221; advises Crypto Stream. At press time, RDNR was trading at $3.56, slightly below the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.60. Bittensor (TAO): Democratizing AI Model Deployment Bittensor&#8217;s aim to decentralize the deployment of machine learning algorithms stands in contrast to RNDR. It aims to challenge the dominance of tech giants in AI, such as OpenAI and Meta, which control the best AI models, by creating a platform for trading specialized AI models. &#8220;Bittensor is opening doors for smaller research teams globally, allowing them to contribute and monetize their specialized AI models,&#8221; states Crypto Stream. This specialized focus actively caters to a variety of needs, including non-English languages and niche industries, often overlooked by larger players. Related Reading: 3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024 Crypto Stream is particularly impressed by Bittensor&#8217;s tokenomics, which are inspired by Bitcoin&#8217;s model. &#8220;With a total supply mirroring Bitcoin&#8217;s, no premine or ICO, and a halving cycle every four years, TAO’s economic design is both robust and promising,&#8221; he comments. Approximately 6 million TAO tokens are currently in circulation, with the token trading near its all-time high of $304. &#8220;TAO&#8217;s current market cap of $1.8 billion and an FDV exceeding $6 billion signify its growing prominence, though much of its supply is yet to be released into the market,&#8221; Crypto Stream added. Which One Is The Best AI Altcoin? Crypto Stream concludes that both RNDR and TAO offer unique and complementary solutions to the AI and crypto sector. RNDR&#8217;s focus is on solving the hardware problem by leveraging unused GPU power, while TAO addresses the software side by enabling a marketplace for AI models. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to declare a definitive leader in the AI token space,&#8221; Crypto Stream reflects, &#8220;as both RNDR and TAO bring innovative solutions to the table. RNDR&#8217;s burn feature and TAO&#8217;s Bitcoin-like tokenomics each have their own appeal, targeting different needs within the AI and crypto markets.&#8221; Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"
