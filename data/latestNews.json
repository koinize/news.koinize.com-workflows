The chosen candidate would be responsible for developing and implementing communication and relationship management strategies for “existing and prospective investors, current shareholders, and financial analysts.”</p><p>The job description emphasizes the candidate’s need to create strategic plans specifically suited for situations like “M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions], investments, liquidity events, and other high-impact moments.“</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone notice the recent job openings at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ripple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Ripple</a>?<br><br>The only reason you need a Shareholders Communication Manager.. is for an IPO.<br><br>;) <a href=\"https://t.co/jpte8wUiFu\">https://t.co/jpte8wUiFu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VAcIKgPltF\">pic.twitter.com/VAcIKgPltF</a></p>&mdash; Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChadSteingraber/status/1713966624619819399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Many XRP proponents and the pro-Ripple community on X (formerly Twitter) are referring to the job posting as a hint that there may be an IPO.

Per those rules, REBS was prohibited from ad promotions soliciting Binance goods and services. </p><p>This evidently left Binance without a U.K. partner in compliance with the FCA’s marketing requirements.</p><p>According to Binance:</p><blockquote>“Binance is currently looking for a new FCA authorised approver. However, there will be some temporary restrictions coming into effect on our Platform (i.e. www.binance.com/en-GB and latest version of our Mobile App) during the period until Binance onboards with a new FCA authorised approver and has its financial promotions reapproved.”</blockquote><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
