    "description": "<p>FTX is reportedly looking to revive its crypto exchange, according to Wall Street Journal report. </p>\n<p>The once-leading crypto exchange FTX which suffered a spectacular collapse and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022, is reportedly exploring the possibility of reviving the FTX.com exchange.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed CEO, John Ray, said the company has begun &ldquo;the process of soliciting interested parties to the reboot of the FTX.com exchange.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>FTX experienced a severe liquidity crisis in November, prompting customers to withdraw an estimated $6 billion over fear that their assets were unsafe on the exchange. The Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) led crypto empire collapsed after news broke that FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research had been sharing assets to boost the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>\n<p>FTX&rsquo;s improper trading of customer funds via Alameda saw SBF step down as CEO of the exchange. The disgraced CEO was charged with various federal crimes, including money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>\nSBF&rsquo;s Request To Dismiss Charges Is Rejected\n<p>On Tuesday, &nbsp;New York federal Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the FTX founder&rsquo;s request to dismiss most of the criminal charges against him over the collapse of the exchange.</p>\n<p>The disgraced founder has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is now accused of misleading investors and lenders.</p>\n<p>Bankman-Fried will stand trial in October.</p>\nFTX Halts Sale of Its Stake in Anthropic\n<p>Bloomberg reported earlier in the week that FTX was set to sell its shares in the AI platform Anthropic but has decided to put the brakes on the sale.</p>\n<p>FTX currently holds over $500 million worth of shares in Anthropic, and the exchange has provided no specific reason for the halt of the sale.</p>\nFTX Management Recover $7B in Liquid Assets\n<p>FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed management team announced this week that it made &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in asset recovery. It revealed that it has thus far recovered $7 billion of liquid assets.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s new management published an investigative report with John Ray explaining the reality of what is going on at the exchange.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "In consideration of recent developments, a bill has been introduced to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a state-administered depository for cryptocurrencies, positioning North Carolina as the custodian of its Bitcoin and virtual asset holdings. However, the proposed study will thoroughly assess the costs and benefits associated with alternatives such as a privately managed depository or utilizing the depository of another state. A Comprehensive Study For North Carolina&#8217;s Financial Holdings On June 28, the House approved a bill that authorizes a comprehensive study with a budget of $50,000. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating gold bullion and virtual currencies like BTC into North Carolina&#8217;s financial holdings. The study aims to examine various aspects, including the secure acquisition, storage, insurance, and liquidation of these assets. One of the main areas of investigation is the potential impact that gold and cryptocurrency holdings could have on North Carolina&#8217;s funds. Specifically, the study intends to assess whether such holdings could serve as a hedge against inflation and mitigate systemic credit risks. Furthermore, it seeks to determine if integrating gold and crypto assets into the portfolio could effectively reduce volatility and enhance overall returns.

By undertaking this study, the House plans to gather crucial insights and evidence that will inform the decision-making process regarding North Carolina&#8217;s investment strategy. The bill emphasizes a neutral and data-driven approach to understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with diversifying the state&#8217;s financial holdings with gold and virtual currencies. The bill was successfully passed in the House with a majority vote of 73 in favor, 40 against, and seven members absent. For it to become law or be subject to a potential veto by Governor Roy Cooper, it must now proceed to the Senate for further consideration. Bitcoin Study: Analysis Of North Carolina&#8217;s Virtual Asset Holdings In a separate legislative initiative, on May 3, North Carolina&#8217;s House unanimously approved a bill that would prohibit payments to the state using a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Additionally, the bill specified that North Carolina would not permit the Federal Reserve to conduct any future pilot CBDC testing within its jurisdiction.
