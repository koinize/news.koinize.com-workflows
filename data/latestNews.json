    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-projection-analyst-envisions-potential-50x-surge-to-14-heres-why/",
    "description": "Since the beginning of December, the XRP price has been range-bound between $0.5762 and $0.6565, lagging behind other altcoins that have seen significant gains due to increased market capital inflows.  However, recent developments surrounding the potential rejection of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have added to market uncertainty and triggered a 10% drop in the XRP price, pushing it toward the $0.500 level. XRP Price Legal Catalyst  Despite these challenges, a significant catalyst could potentially propel XRP to new heights—the ongoing legal clash between Ripple Labs and the SEC regarding XRP sales.  Related Reading: Arbitrum Reaches Major Milestone In TVL As Price Rallies Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has expressed optimism, stating that a 40X or even 50X boom is possible for XRP, citing the impressive performance of the cryptocurrency in the previous cycle despite the SEC lawsuit. Egrag Crypto stated: Last cycle, despite the pesky SEC lawsuit, XRP surged almost 20X. This time, with its unparalleled legal regulatory clarity, the potential for a 40X or even 50X boom seems promising By the numbers, according to Egrag Crypto’s analysis, at its cycle low of $0.28, a 40X surge could potentially push the price to around $11.  Taking it further, a 50X leap might see XRP soar to around $14. To put this into perspective, Egrag, compared with Ethereum’s (ETH) previous cycle multiplier of 58X, XRP at $0.28 could reach an astounding $16.  While XRP&#8217;s future holds promise, the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains a focal point for investors. Understanding the key dates in the legal proceedings is crucial. Here is a breakdown of the upcoming milestones: Key Dates Revealed For Ripple-SEC Legal Battle In 2024 12th February 2024: Remedies briefing begins: Ripple and the SEC will present their respective arguments and proposals regarding potential remedies for the legal dispute on this date. This briefing will provide insights into the parties&#8217; positions and suggested resolutions. 13th March 2024: SEC files remedies brief: Following the remedies brief, the SEC will submit a remedies brief outlining their proposed solutions to address the alleged violations committed by Ripple. This filing will further clarify the SEC&#8217;s stance and the actions they seek against Ripple. 12th April 2024: Ripple submits opposition: Ripple will have an opportunity to present their opposition to the SEC&#8217;s proposed remedies. They will outline their arguments against the SEC&#8217;s allegations and offer counterarguments and alternative solutions.  29th April 2024: SEC replies: The SEC will be able to respond to Ripple&#8217;s opposition. They will address Ripple&#8217;s arguments and provide additional justification for their proposed remedies.
