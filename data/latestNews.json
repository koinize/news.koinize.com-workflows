Otherwise, it gave long and verbose answers that attempted to dance around the question.</p><p>Trolls inventing ways to get AIs to say racist or offensive stuff has been a feature of chatbots ever since Twitter users taught Microsofts <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Tay</a> bot to say all kinds of insane stuff in the first 24 hours after it was released, including that Ricky Gervais learned totalitarianism from Adolf Hitler, the inventor of atheism.</p><p>And the minute ChatGPT was released, users spent weeks devising clever schemes to <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/6f4f7b30129b0251f61fa7baaa881516?permalink_comment_id=4522179\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >jailbreak</a> it so that it would act outside its guardrails as its evil alter ego DAN. </p><p>So its not surprising that OpenAI would strengthen ChatGPTs guardrails to the point where it is almost impossible to get it to say racist stuff, no matter what the reason.<br><br>In any case, the more advanced GPT-4 is able to weigh the issues involved with the thorny hypothetical much better than 3.5  and states that saying a slur is the lesser of two evils compared with letting millions die. And Xs new Grok AI can too as Musk proudly posted (above right).</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-s-q-breaks-encryption-says-some-guy-on-4chan\"><strong>OpenAIs Q* breaks encryption, says some guy on 4chan</strong></h2><p>Has OpenAIs latest model broken encryption? Probably not, but thats what a supposedly leaked letter from an insider claims  which was posted on anonymous troll forum 4chan. There have been rumors flying about ever since CEO Sam Altman was sacked and reinstated, that the kerfuffle was caused by OpenAI making a breakthrough in its Q*/Q STAR project.</p><p>The insiders <a href=\"https://t.co/Umu7hEhge9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >leak</a> suggests the model can solve AES-192 and AES-256 encryption using a ciphertext attack. Breaking that level of encryption was thought to be impossible before quantum computers arrived, and if true, it would likely mean all encryption could be broken effectively handing over control of the web and probably crypto too, to OpenAI.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4chan-leak.jpg\" alt=\"Leak\" class=\"wp-image-26123\" width=\"387\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4chan-leak.jpg 523w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4chan-leak-246x300.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">From QANON to Q STAR, 4chan is first with the news.</figcaption></figure><p>Blogger <a href=\"https://leapdragon.net/2023/11/25/world-may-be-about-to-turn-upside-down-and-almost-nobody-even-realizes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >leapdragon</a> claimed the breakthrough would mean there is now effectively a team of superhumans over at OpenAI who can literally rule the world if they so choose.</p><p>It seems unlikely however. While whoever wrote the letter has a good understanding of AI research, users pointed out that it cites Project Tunda as if it were some sort of shadowy super secret government program to break encryption rather than the undergrad student program it actually was.<br><br>Tundra, a collaboration between students and NSA mathematicians, did reportedly lead to a new approach called Tau Analysis, which the leak also cites. However, a Redditor familiar with the subject claimed in the Singularity forum that it would be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1869khc/a_basic_explanation_of_why_the_4chan_q_leak_is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >impossible</a> to use Tau analysis in a ciphertext-only attack on an AES standard as a successful attack would require an arbitrarily large ciphertext message to discern any degree of signal from the noise. There is no fancy algorithm that can overcome that  its simply a physical limitation.<br><br>Advanced cryptography is beyond AI Eye’s pay grade, so feel free to dive down the <a href=\"https://t.co/Umu7hEhge9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >rabbit hole </a>yourself, with an appropriately skeptical mindset.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-internet-heads-toward-99-fake\"><strong>The internet heads toward 99% fake</strong></h2><p>Long before a superintelligence poses an existential threat to humanity, we are all likely to have drowned in a flood of AI-generated bullsh*t.<br><br>Sports Illustrated came under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/28/sports-illustrated-ai-writers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >fire</a> this week for allegedly publishing AI-written articles written by fake AI-created authors.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-3-factors/",
    "description": "The XRP price keeps being projected to enjoy a massive rally soon enough. Many have continued to speculate when this might happen. A crypto analyst has some answers, as he has highlighted three key indicators that could trigger this rally.  Three Determinants For A “Parabolic Move” In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst JD noted that XRP’s monthly was coming. He went on to state three things that “need” to happen if XRP is to see a massive rally. The first factor he highlighted was the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI). He stated that there has to be a bullish cross on the SRSI. Related Reading: MasterCard Coming To XRP? Prominent Developer Teases Major Upgrade The SRSI is a technical indicator that is generally used to forecast market trends. It measures the strengths and weaknesses of the relative strength indicator (RSI). It is from this RSI it also derives its value from.  Source: X Still emphasizing the SRSI, JD stated that the second factor is that both SRSI lines must cross above 80. This level refers to an overbought condition in the XRP market. As such, it is unclear why JD considers it bullish, considering that traders usually see an overbought condition as a sell signal with an impending correction in mind.  XRP Price To Breakout In 2025 For the third factor, JD alluded to an 8-year trendline break. In the accompanying chart that he shared, one could see that he was projecting XRP to break out in 2025 following 8 years of consolidation. In the chart, he also highlighted how XRP broke out in 2017 after a 4-year consolidation.  Some analysts seem to be betting on XRP, enjoying a similar rally to the one that happened back in 2017. The crypto token is known to have seen a 61,000% gain in 280 days and crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK recently shared his thoughts on that happening. Without directly stating if a repeat could happen, he outlined several factors that put XRP in a better position than then. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $346 Million Into Crypto – Here Are The Winners Another crypto analyst who has referred to the 2017 period in his projection is Egrag Crypto. He recently mentioned that $27 is a “plausible target” for XRP’s price with the 2017 surge in mind. He didn’t, however, mention when exactly XRP could attain such heights. More recently, Egrag stated that XRP is on the “brink of a bullish cross.” Many analysts continue to give their opinion on what price level XRP could hit, with some stating that XRP could rise to as high as $10,000. It remains to be seen how much of these bullish projections will be actualized. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.61, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Token price holds $0.61 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Xataka, chart from Tradingview.com"
