The N1 can be attached to any variety of items, with use cases ranging from logistics to track and trace applications.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/4ca5b2de-7bf5-4ea1-8cd3-5492805f9157.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">An artist's impression of the Nodle Nancomputer N1 bluetooth chip.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Nodle co-founder Garrett Kinsman said the intended use of the devices it to “bring intelligence to assets” that are not yet linked to an IOT network or are physically difficult to connect:</p><blockquote>“Among the most relevant use cases are the tracking of shipping pallets, an old industry with volumes up to 6 billions units per year; they tried to use cellular or LoRawan radios and these solutions turned out to be too energy intensive and costly.”</blockquote><p>While Nodle will use the devices to increase the coverage and connectivity of devices utilizing its bluetooth-based blockchain network, Kinsman believes their decision to make the technology open source stands to benefit the wider IoT industry.</p><blockquote>“Anyone building on the Nodle network can use the license, start printing and using Nodle N1 stickers. The purpose of open sourcing a hardware platform is to accelerate the adoption and the innovation in the space.”</blockquote><p>Furthermore, the impact of blockchain technology provides a decentralized alternative to conventional IoT networks that host data from sensors and devices on centralized servers. Kinsman said that the latter relies on trust in a centralized point, which can be hacked, tampered with or modified:</p><blockquote>“By pushing a public private keypair into each sticker, the sensors themselves can act as a root of trust. This makes manipulating data or tampering with the overall system significantly harder as the root of trust lies at the edge.”</blockquote><p>As previously explored by Cointelegraph, Nodle’s network taps into bluetooth connectivity of a variety of smart devices to rent computing power, storage and communication capabilities. Nodle’s essentially uses smartphones to locate and connect nearby bluetooth-connected objects in over 160 countries.</p><p>Kinsman also touched on the environmental impact of bluetooth devices and N1’s approach to lessen its footprint. While the N1 uses a powered tag to provide enough energy for more advanced functionality of its hardware, it makes use of a rechargeable, zinc based battery that is touted to have 92% lower greenhouse gas impact than older generation power sources.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/iot-project-turns-smartphones-into-blockchain-nodes-to-broaden-connectivity\"><strong><em>Related: IoT project turns smartphones into blockchain nodes to broaden connectivity</em></strong></a></p><p>Kinsman added that these batteries can last for years depending on usage, but running a Bluetooth chipset will generally last 12-24 months depending on the use case.</p><p>The hardware itself is touted as Web3 native hardware, featuring a secure element that encrypts data. The N1 also has a processor that is capable of running basic applications that can communicate with the Nodle blockchain.</p><p>The devices are envisioned to provide further capabilities to conventional asset tracking, by providing measurable metrics and data including temperature, humidity, light and motion sensors. </p><p>A long term goal for the hardware is to be able to host files, communicate with satellites and form part of mesh networks.</p><p><em>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/green-consumers-want-supply-chain-transparency-blockchain/\">Green consumers want supply chain transparency via blockchain</a></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"nifty_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
