Let us be honest about what we are doing here: banning technologies we do not like.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Peirce also rejected the SEC dismissive approach to disclosure within the proposal, when it makes the assumption that &ldquo;disclosure is of no use to investors&rdquo;, remarking that &ldquo;the whole premise of our disclosure regime is that investors can think for themselves.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She makes the case that the proposal just doesn&rsquo;t take into account &ldquo;operational feasibility&rdquo;, saying that broker dealers and investment advisors would have to carry out a &ldquo;conflict identification process&rdquo; with &ldquo;Eye-wateringly detailed written policies and procedures&rdquo; for evaluating potential conflicts and how they would be dealt with.</p>\n<p>Once again, Hester Peirce has taken her own agency to task for what she sees as an over-complicated proposal that is likely to put smaller businesses off of using the technologies in question, and in her view is generally not needed.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/spotting-the-next-multichain-how-to-evaluate-crypto-bridges",
    "description": "<p>The Multichain bridge, one of the oldest and more established token bridges used in DeFi, has suffered a $126 million loss in July, making it one of the larger bridge hacks in history.</p>\n<p>But this one is different from previous hacks like the Nomad bridge. No code was really compromised, as reportedly the assets were taken by the CEO&rsquo;s sister. Multichain&rsquo;s CEO, known only as Zhaojun, was apparently apprehended by Chinese authorities a few weeks prior.</p>\n<p>The CEO&rsquo;s disappearance wreaked havoc on the team&rsquo;s operations, according to their own report. Zhaojun held several important keys that were important for the operation and maintenance of the protocol. According to the explanation published by the Multichain team, they had asked his sister for access to these keys via cloud backups. Allegedly, she then took the money &ldquo;for safekeeping&rdquo; only to be arrested herself shortly after.</p>\n<p>The incident highlighted what some industry experts and insiders knew all along: Multichain was an extremely centralized bridge, which literally ceased to function as soon as its CEO became unavailable. For a crypto project, this is a damning story &mdash; even traditional corporations are more decentralized than that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why this wasn&rsquo;t spotted</p>\n<p>Given these revelations, it seems surprising that people trusted Multichain enough to have hundreds of millions of dollars deposited on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Venket Naga, CEO at blockchain privacy-preserving platform, Serenity Shield, gave a few ideas how this might have happened. &ldquo;First, the code's complexity may have made it challenging for non-experts to identify potential loopholes. Second, there might have been limited transparency and auditing, allowing crucial issues to go unnoticed,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>Because of their cross-chain nature, bridges are often a black box. Even though Multichain&rsquo;s core architecture is open-source, the complexity of these systems means that it&rsquo;s difficult to have a good understanding of how it&rsquo;s all implemented.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trust in the code's integrity might have been assumed, neglecting the need for robust security assessments,&rdquo; added Naga. &ldquo;Moving forward, conducting comprehensive audits, fostering transparency, and engaging the community are crucial to prevent similar situations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Bridge Choice 101</p>\n<p>Bridge vulnerabilities are a common theme in Web3, and many teams deemed competent and reputable suffered enormous losses. So how can an average user try to avoid these incidents and spot unsafe bridges from further away?</p>\n<p>There is no perfect standard, but ideally it should be a mix of robust decentralization, simple architecture and good history of operation.</p>\n<p>For example, for bridges running on some form of trusted validators (which applies to most of them), you would expect that these entities should be well-known, and at least somewhat separate from the bridge&rsquo;s creators.</p>\n<p>Architecture-wise, most bridges today are quite simple contracts based on multi-signature cryptography. More decentralized options have emerged from time to time, most notably Nomad. Unfortunately, these solutions are more complex, so this bridge got hacked because of one poorly implemented line of code.</p>\n<p>A good indicator is time. Poor bridges fail and only the sturdy options remain after some time &mdash; though Multichain is a significant exception to this rule. Many existing bridges have already gone through hacks, notably Wormhole. At the time, the project got &ldquo;bailed out&rdquo; by Jump Crypto, which allowed it to resume operations and re-establish some level of trust.</p>\n<p>But this apparent &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be taken for granted. According to Brandon Brown, CEO and Co-Founder of personal wallet theft protection FairSide, &ldquo;bridges present complex challenges for cover providers due to centralization and the risks associated with smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Bridges are a crucial aspect of blockchain usage, but their implementation leaves much to be desired.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To rebuild trust in blockchain bridges, a comprehensive approach is crucial,&rdquo; according to Naga. &ldquo;Implementing enhanced security measures, transparent bridge design and operations, rigorous audits, and involving the community in governance are essential.</p>\n\n<p>For Broen, &ldquo;innovative solutions are emerging, such as Axelar's Interchain, which offer promising potential in mitigating the inherent risks of interoperability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hopefully, these solutions come sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown much resilience in the wake of the US Federal Reserve announcing a 25 basis points hike in the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) on Wednesday. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, the premier cryptocurrency is up by 0.78% in the last 24 hours, with the majority of the market also posting notable gains. However, a crypto analyst has predicted a significant bearish trend for the market leader. Incoming Dip For Bitcoin?  According to a technical report on July 27 by an analyst with the Twitter handle @CryptoFaibik, BTC is likely to plummet in value by 15-20% in the coming weeks.  Related Reading: FOMC Delivers Expected 0.25% Rate Hike, Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $29,000 However, the analyst noted that Bitcoin could first hit the $32,000 mark, indicating an imminent potential 8.6% gain on the token’s current market price. I think $BTC will hit 32k first, and then We may Witness a 15-20% Correction in the Coming Weeks. Share Your Thoughts 💭#Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/Qni4cCBxLX — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) July 27, 2023 Following @CryptoFaibik&#8217;s predictions, BTC is then expected to fall to around $25,000, with a breakout below its current ascending channel, as seen on the daily chart.  While this might be an interesting projection, it is worth stating that there were no specific reasons backing this bearish outlook. In fact, there has been a positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin in the last few weeks. Besides its recent positive performance in the face of the Fed rate hike, the market leader appears to be poised for an increase in institutional demand. Currently, prominent asset managers have filed applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) seeking approval to launch the first Spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States On July 20, Bitcoin research firm NYDIG reported that the approval of these ETF applications could result in $30 billion in new demand for Bitcoin.  The report stated this prediction is based on several factors, including the brand recognition that asset managers such as BlackRock offer, alongside the popular understanding of the regular trading methods of securities brokers.  BTC Trading At $29480 On The Daily Chart &#124; Source: BTCUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Bitcoin Marks Highest Social Dominance In Two Weeks In other news, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience amidst the increased Federal Funding Rate has garnered much attention among investors, with the token’s social dominance recording a significant boost. According to data by on-chain analytics company, Santiment, Bitcoin now accounts for one-third of all discussions surrounding the top 100 crypto assets. Its social dominance stands at 33.33%, the highest it has been in the last two weeks.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 Santiment further highlighted that an increased social dominance indicated fear which means a price rise is likely on the horizon.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $29,406.94, with a 0.16% decline in the last hour. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume has surged by 20.46% and is valued at $12.97 billion. With a market cap of $571.05 billion, Bitcoin ranks as the largest cryptocurrency in the market.
