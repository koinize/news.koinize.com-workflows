The strategy should set up a platform for information exchange and monitoring, analyze promising areas for disruption, advise the government on promising initiatives and support the government in implementing selected initiatives.</p><p>The government should also pursue international cooperation in developing blockchain regulations and policies, conduct innovative pilot projects using distributed ledgers, adopt a distinct regulatory approach to stablecoins, promote the establishment of federally regulated cryptocurrency custodians and provide access to banking and insurance services for blockchain firms. </p><p>The report stated that a public awareness campaign should be established to educate the public about risks related to cryptocurrencies and the benefits of<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-a-beginners-guide-to-digital-money\"> accessing cryptocurrency markets</a> through regulated Canadian entities.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-fictitious-regulatory-certificate-canadian-securities-administrators-csa\"><strong><em>Crypto firms tout ‘fictitious’ regulatory stamps, Canadian regulator warns</em></strong></a></p><p>In a bid to ensure that blockchain technology becomes mainstream, the government should investigate ways to promote the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chains and study the new opportunities this technology presents for electronic voting, consultation and modernization of democratic institutions. </p><p>Recently the Department of Finance <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/notice324/proposed-amendment-addressing-mining-activities-respect-cryptoassets.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> legislative changes to Excise Tax Act, addressing GST/HST application to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining\">crypto asset mining </a>and remuneration.
