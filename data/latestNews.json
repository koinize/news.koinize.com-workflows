    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-partner-xrp-holdings/",
    "description": "In a recent development, the crypto holdings of Ripple’s most recent partner, Uphold, have been highlighted as further evidence that the Web3 financial platform is very bullish on the Ripple ecosystem and the utility token XRP, which is used to facilitate transactions on Ripple Payments (formerly known as ODL).  Uphold’s Largest Crypto Holding In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton quoted a report that stated that XRP made up Uphold’s largest crypto holding. The platform is said to hold $1.25 billion worth of the token in customer funds. This is more impressive as Uphold’s customers only hold $168 million worth of Bitcoin on the platform.     Related Reading: Why This 70-Year-Old Billionaire Wants To Own Bitcoin Deaton could not hold back his surprise at these figures as it meant that there were almost 10 times more XRP on the platform in comparison to BTC. As to the reason why Uphold may have such a large XRP holding, YouTuber Matt stated that it could be from the platform getting all the businesses from their competitors when they delisted the token.  Major crypto exchanges, including the second largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Coinbase, delisted the XRP token after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the company and its executives back in 2020. While agreeing with Matt’s comment, Deaton also mentioned how XRP contributed to Uphold’s growth, noting that the token represented “62%” of the company’s trading fees for over two years. He further mentioned how Uphold only had five million users when he signed up on the platform, but now, it boasts 30 million users.  XRP On The Platform Set To Increase The XRP holdings on the platform are expected to increase with the newly forged partnership between Ripple and Uphold. As part of the partnership, Uphold will provide its infrastructure to be used in furtherance of the Ripple Payments service, which focuses on cross-border transactions.  Related Reading: Time To Exit Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Predicts 75% Breakdown To $8,000 Uphold will further provide Ripple with the liquidity needed to process these transactions. To achieve this, Uphold has stated that it won’t use its existing customers’ XRP holdings but will instead use its “expertise” to source XRP on the open market.  Uphold has, over time, shown to be a firm believer in Ripple’s vision, and many in the XRP community seem to be very supportive of the partnership, with some highlighting how Uphold stuck by the token through “thick and thin.” At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.57, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
