It also employs “Langchain,” a library used for simplifying operations with AI applications. </p><blockquote>“With the tools we're releasing today, developers will be able to build more accessible AI infrastructure for both humans and agents alike.” </blockquote><p>The Lightning Labs team also acknowledged the problem with current LLMs, which lack native web-based payment mechanisms. AI application developers are forced to rely on dated payment methods such as credit cards with the additional expenses passed on to users, it claimed. </p><p>\"A new fast-growing class of ‘organisms’ (intelligent LLM or AI Agents) are unable to easily gain access to fiat systems of payment as they aren’t registered 'entities' with any nation,\" it noted. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-state-of-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-in-2023\"><strong><em>The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023</em></strong></a></p><p>Speaking on the “Stack Sats” podcast on July 6, Kody Low, developer at the community payments platform Fedi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kerooke/status/1676725582741090304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">commented</a> on the interoperability between AI and BTC for payments: </p><blockquote>“AI is one of those things where there is absolutely no better solution anywhere in the world than Bitcoin, and AI companies have not yet solved their monetization problems.”</blockquote><p>According to data from LN analytics platform 1ML, the current LN capacity is 5,432 BTC or roughly $163.5 million.
