    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-teeters-on-the-edge-of-glory-will-it-smash-the-70000-resistance/",
    "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been making waves with its steady climb towards setting a new all-time high (ATH), currently finding a foothold at the $68,000 zone. This level of performance represents a culmination of investor confidence, market dynamics, and underlying economic factors that paint a broader picture of the digital currency&#8217;s &#8220;resilience and appeal.&#8221; Crypto analyst Ali has recently shed light on a critical juncture in Bitcoin&#8217;s journey, identifying a significant resistance level that could influence its short-term price movements. Related Reading: Get Ready For A Bitcoin Cash Revolution: Analyst Forecasts Historic Breakout Key Resistance Awaits Ali&#8217;s analysis brings to the forefront a specific resistance barrier that Bitcoin faces on its path to achieving a new ATH. According to Ali, a resistance level at $70,320, characterized by a total volume of 599,260 BTC held by 736,380 addresses, stands as the gatekeeper to further bullish momentum. Surpassing this threshold could potentially catalyze Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent, further solidifying its status as the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency market. This resistance particularly represents the collective anticipation and strategic positioning of hundreds of thousands of investors who have staked their claims in Bitcoin&#8217;s digital gold. #Bitcoin finds solid ground at $68,300, yet a break below could lead to a downswing to the next support range at $65,250-$63,150, where 760,000 wallets hold 520,000 $BTC. On the brighter side, securing $70,320 as support is vital for #BTC next leg up! pic.twitter.com/EMPBRRADzT — Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2024 Meanwhile, the crypto market&#8217;s sentiment has been a rollercoaster, with Bitcoin experiencing a slight retreat, marking a 1.4% decrease over the past week and a 2.4% dip in the last 24 hours, landing at a market price of $68,448, at the time of writing. Caution Amid Bitcoin Record Streak Amidst this backdrop, author and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer has voiced his observations, suggesting that the market is &#8220;the most overbought&#8221; it has been in a while. The observations come just as Bitcoin marks its seventh month of positive performance, a milestone last achieved in 2012. This period of growth is highlighted by a monthly candlestick chart closing higher than the peak of its last cycle. Adding to this &#8220;overbought&#8221; sentiment by Jim Cramer is a transaction of the seventh wealthiest Bitcoin address withdrawing 8,889 BTC from Bitfinex, valued at roughly $627 million, recorded by Peckshield.
