    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-sv-climbs-22-a-close-look-at-the-factors-behind-the-surge/",
    "description": "Despite seeing a notable increase of 15.2% in value yesterday, the current price of Bitcoin SV remains steady at a little over $39 compared to the previous day. The current market situation involves a struggle with the immediate dynamic resistance level, leading to a state of uneasiness among traders. Bitcoin SV, a Bitcoin fork, is now the most profitable cryptocurrency out of the top 100 by market capitalization. Related Reading: Polkadot Road To Recovery – Will $4 Mark The Turning Point? The value of the world&#8217;s cryptocurrency market increased to $1.09 trillion at the time of writing, a 1.4% gain in a day. On Tuesday, ETH increased by about 0.1% to $1,585, while BTC was up 2.6% at $28,466.60. SEC Influence On Crypto Rally And BSV Price Spike The recent rally in cryptocurrency prices was primarily driven by optimism about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving a Bitcoin ETF. This sentiment was strengthened when the SEC chose not to appeal the Grayscale lawsuit. However, there was a spike in BSV prices due to a false report from CoinTelegraph claiming that the SEC was anticipating the iShares Bitcoin Trust, pushing Bitcoin to nearly $30,000 before it quickly dropped. At the time of writing, BSV occupies the No. 48 spot and was trading at $39.40, up 22% in the last seven days, data form crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. The RSI for BSV is 67.58, the same as it was yesterday. This RSI level is slowly approaching overbought zone, which could indicate that a little correction or consolidation in the price of BSV is imminent. BSV market cap currently at $757 million. Chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin SV is displaying positive indicators in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. Its market cap has risen by 1.22% to reach $757 million, and its 24-hour trading volume has surged by a significant 83% to $238 million. This increased trading activity suggests growing trader interest and the potential for BSV&#8217;s price to continue moving upward. Related Reading: Solana Price Direction Remains Hazy Despite 10% Weekly Rally When market confidence persisted, the price of Bitcoin Cash also surged. The robust performance of American stocks served as an example of the increase. The S&#38;P 500 and Dow Jones both experienced gains of more than 1%, but the Nasdaq 100 index saw a leap of more than 1.10%. Cryptocurrencies have historically performed well on rising stock prices. Bitcoin SV Price At Resistance Zone: Potential For An Upside Break Meanwhile, the current price of BSV is encountering a horizontal resistance zone ranging from $38.5 to $40.6. This resistance zone is also in alignment with the Fibonacci 0.5 level, at $39.75. The possibility of a successful breach of this resistance level may indicate a sustained higher trajectory for Bitcoin SV. Concurrently, there exists a proximate support region ranging from $33.85 to $36.10, which aligns with the Fibonacci 0.618 level of $35.89 and the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $34.79. In the event that the BSV price is unable to maintain its position above the designated support zone, there is a possibility of an impending negative trend.
