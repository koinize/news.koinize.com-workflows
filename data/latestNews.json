    "description": "Arbitrum (ARB), a prominent Ethereum scaling solution, encountered a significant downtime event on December 15, according to the network&#8217;s status page.  The incident prompted an immediate investigation into the root cause and the deployment of a fix. As of the time of writing, the Arbitrum One network remained inaccessible for over 60 minutes due to sequencer and feed issues. Arbitrum Struggles With Network Downtime The status update from Arbitrum acknowledged the problem, stating that the Arbitrum One Sequencer and Feed stalled at 10:29 AM ET amidst a notable surge in network traffic.  Notably, Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, alleged that the outage experienced within the Arbitrum network was a result of ordinals. Köppelmann remarked that the stress testing of various blockchains using ordinals had led to the disruption, stating, &#8220;Ordinals stress testing various blockchains is certainly entertaining to watch. Now they brought the Arbitrum sequencer down.&#8221; Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin 2023 Bull Run Releases New Target In addition to the sequencer and feed issues, Arbitrum also encountered a halt in block production, ceasing to generate new blocks approximately 1.5 hours ago.
