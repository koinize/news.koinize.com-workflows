She likes to jump into the metaverse to work when her kids are at school and the house is quiet.</p><p>Then there was Miguel, a recruiter at Netflix, an OG user of the virtual reality app Immersed, whos been using it to work for the last two years.</p><p>The big question is: <em>Why would you want to?</em></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-only-two-hours-in-my-eyes-are-burning\"><strong>Only two hours in, my eyes are burning</strong></h2><p>As impressive as it all sounds, after working in the metaverse for a week myself, Im not sure how anyone could do it for longer.</p><p>I spent most of the seven days clocking in and out through the virtual coworking app Immersed, which can be found on the Meta Quest store but can be downloaded from other platforms, too.</p><p>Most days, I would be joined by as many as a dozen other VR users, depending on the time of day and which public workspace I chose.

When you first strap on the Meta Quest 3 headset, the device will scan your surroundings to understand where you are within your room (in my case, the office) and where certain obstacles are, such as bookshelves, desks and chairs. This is so it can warn you if youre getting too close to a wall or obstacle when youre immersed in VR.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VR-10.jpg\" alt=\"Real\" class=\"wp-image-25451\" width=\"355\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VR-10.jpg 512w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VR-10-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VR-10-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Virtual screens can be positioned in your real working space, allowing one to be more present in the real world.</em></figcaption></figure><p>To be able to interact with your computer in virtual reality, theres a companion app that needs to be installed on your PC, which will then allow the app to retrieve the necessary information from your computer and beam it into your headset via cable or WiFi in the same way most remote desktop apps work.</p><p>In Immersed, your virtual screens can be rotated, resized and moved anywhere you want. You can even choose to work in mixed reality, allowing you to superimpose virtual screens among your real-life surroundings.</p><p>But it wasnt much help. At the end of each day, I was left nursing a splitting headache and trying to rub the immense strain from my eyes. My neck always felt stiff, a side effect of being weighed down by the bulky headset.</p><p>And for what? Most days, I struggled to achieve the same level of output compared to a regular day in front of the PC.</p><p>My experience is far from unique.

This echoes assumptions from his previous interview in early September, when BTC/USD <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-46k-2024-halving-interview-filbfilb\">traded at just below $26,000</a>.</p><p>That said, a drawdown could easily come first, testing the morale of those who might already be used to BTC price upside.</p><p>Continue reading to discover what the coming months could have in store for Bitcoin from a technical price perspective.</p><p><strong>Cointelegraph (CT): Do you think that BTC has definitively broken out of its previous range below $30,000? How would you gauge the strength of the various moving averages (MAs) which previously acted as resistance?</strong></p><p><strong>Filbfilb (FF)</strong>: The 20, 50, 100 and 200-week simple moving averages are all around $30,000 at the moment. They also lie toward the top of the trading range below $30,000 and above $25,000, in which Bitcoin spent 200 days or so. </p><p>The two combined would suggest that there will be buying interest below and together are a strong indicator of a breakout and trend change from the two-year bear market. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-11/6b972f75-79bb-4d5b-813c-e1afd2b963fb.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USD chart with MAs displayed.
