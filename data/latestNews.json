Despite the questionable use of the term “relative,” which doesn’t precisely match a three-month low, it’s still worth examining the macroeconomic trends surrounding past halvings.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BTC</a> halvings have coincidentally arrived at local lows in treasury yields each of the first 3 times. After these moments, risk assets rose broadly while growth expectations also improved.<br><br>Thus a myopic Bitcoin narrative about supply shocks was born. But it was always macro. <a href=\"https://t.co/KGQ4TMeKWC\">pic.twitter.com/KGQ4TMeKWC</a></p>&mdash;  (@TXMCtrades) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TXMCtrades/status/1703801851374608781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>First and foremost, it’s important to emphasize that the author asserts that the correlation should not be taken as a “direct causal link between yields and BTC price.” Furthermore, TMXC argues that over 92% of Bitcoin’s supply has already been issued, suggesting that daily issuance is unlikely to be the factor “propping up the asset’s price.”</p><h2>Could the 10-year yield chart be useful vs. Bitcoin?</h2><p>First, it’s essential to recognize that human perception is naturally inclined to spot correlations and trends, whether real or imaginary. </p><p>For instance, during Bitcoin’s first halving, the 10-year yield <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-yields-are-rising-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin-price\">had been steadily rising</a> for four months, making it challenging to label that date as a pivotal moment for the metric.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/61d0fc27-bed6-40e6-8c22-53f456c53d71.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>U.S. government bonds 10-year yield, 2012. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>One might give some benefit of the doubt since, in fact, leading up to Nov. 28, 2012, yields dipped below 1.60%, a level not seen in the previous three months. Essentially, after the first Bitcoin halving, fixed-income investors chose to reverse the trend by selling off Treasurys, thereby pushing yields higher.</p><p>However, the most intriguing aspect emerges around Bitcoin’s third halving in May 2020, in terms of the “relative” bottom of yields. Yields plunged below 0.8% approximately 45 days before the event and remained at that level for more than four months.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/af5d9571-5f5f-404f-b3c0-b82f45f80d9a.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>U.S. government bonds 10-year yield, 2020. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s challenging to argue that the 10-year yield hit its lowest point near the third halving, especially when Bitcoin’s price only gained 20% in the ensuing four months. By comparison, the second halving in July 2016 was followed by a mere 10% gain over four months. </p><p>Consequently, attempting to attribute Bitcoin’s bull run to a specific event with an undefined end date lacks statistical merit.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-danger-us-dollar-index-golden-cross\">Bitcoin price at risk? US Dollar Index confirms bullish ‘golden cross’</a></em></strong></p><p>Therefore, even if one concedes the idea of “relative” local lows on the 10-year yield chart, there’s no compelling evidence that Bitcoin’s halving date directly impacted its price, at least in the subsequent four months. </p><p>While these findings don’t align with TMXC’s hypothesis, they raise an interesting question about the macroeconomic factors at play during actual Bitcoin price rallies.</p><h2>No Bitcoin rally is the same, regardless of the halving</h2><p>Between Oct. 5, 2020 and Jan. 5, 2021, Bitcoin saw a remarkable 247% increase in its value. This rally occurred five months after the halving, prompting us to question what notable events surrounded that period. </p><p>For instance, during that time, the Russell 2000 Small-Capitalization index outperformed S&amp;P 500 companies by a significant margin, with a 14.5% difference in performance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-09/c36d11c1-518b-4e9b-a36d-9676c08ced32.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Russell 2000 small-cap index relative to the S&amp;P 500 (blue, right) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange, left). Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>This data suggests that investors were seeking higher-risk profiles, given that the median market capitalization of Russell 2000 companies stood at $1.25 billion, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's $77.2 billion. </p><p>Consequently, whatever drove this movement, it appears to have been associated with a momentum toward riskier assets rather than any trends in Treasury yields four months prior.</p><p>In conclusion, charts can be misleading when analyzing extended time periods. Linking Bitcoin’s rally to a solitary event lacks statistical rigor when the upswing generally initiates three or four months after the said event. </p><p>This underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of the cryptocurrency market, one that acknowledges the multifaceted factors influencing Bitcoin’s price dynamics rather than relying solely on simplistic correlations or isolated data points.</p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
