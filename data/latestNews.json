    "description": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">In the wake of Worldcoin's recent launch, the project's biometric data collection process has come under the scrutiny of France's privacy watchdog, CNIL.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">The innovative crypto project, led by ChatGPT-founder Sam Altman, requires users to provide iris scans in exchange for a unique digital ID and, in certain countries, free cryptocurrency. According to a breaking report from Reuters, CNIL has expressed concerns over the legality of this process, particularly the conditions for storing biometric data. The crypto firm had also been recently under the eye of UK's data watchdogs, a few weeks after it disclosed collaboration with Auth0 in Berlin.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Worldcoin's Approach to User Identity: A Double-Edged Sword?</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Worldcoin, which boasts 2.1 million users predominantly from a two-year trial period, operates a global network of 'orbs,' shiny spherical devices capable of scanning users' irises. Despite this novel approach to establishing user identity, or \"proof of personhood,\" the project's method has been perceived as questionable, leading to an investigation by Britain's data regulator this week.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">CNIL, in response to a Reuters query on Worldcoin, stated that</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">\"The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Further, CNIL's investigations indicated that jurisdiction over the project lies with the Bavarian state authority in Germany, now conducting the investigation with CNIL's support.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">Worldcoin Foundation's Stance on Privacy Concerns</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">In response to these legal concerns, the Worldcoin Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based entity and self-proclaimed \"steward of the Worldcoin protocol,\" maintains that its project is designed to protect individual privacy. The foundation also claims to have built a robust privacy program and is committed to meeting regulatory requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">\"The Worldcoin Foundation complies with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available,\" the foundation said in an email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Notably, the regulator sspecified that the project is supervised in the European Union by the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision and will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices.</p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "This time around, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, Tesla, is creating a flurry of excitement around cryptocurrencies, maybe with a particular focus on Dogecoin, the well-known parody cryptocurrency. The crypto community has taken note of Musk&#8217;s recent acts since they continue to demonstrate his influence in altering the market dynamics of digital currency. The billionaire Musk, who is also the owner of the X app (formerly known as Twitter), posted on Sunday that &#8220;something special is coming soon.&#8221; Related Reading: CryptoPunks Toughness Tested As NFT Succumbs To 60% Drop In 1 Week Elon Musk Tweet Does It Again This tweet received a lot of positive feedback from the cryptocurrency community, especially from accounts with a Dogecoin theme. Something special coming soon — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2023 Based on Musk&#8217;s repeated references to this development in the past, many people, including the influencer David Gokhstein, anticipate that X will add DOGE &#8211; the largest meme coin &#8211; as a payment option. This anticipation arises from the fact that Elon Musk has previously made a number of very quiet signals that a similar action may be planned. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a stunning price increase on Friday, garnering a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. On that particular day, DOGE&#8217;s price noticedably increased by over 10%, breaking past the $0.07 barrier mark. Dogecoin Rising At $0.08 When this article was being written, DOGE was trading at $0.08, up 2.7% over the previous day. However, the meme coin really proved its worth on a weekly basis, rising in value by about 13% in response to Musk&#8217;s post. Source: Coingecko This positive momentum-driven upward rise in value led to a sizable increase in the market capitalisation of the asset. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap increased as a result, rising by an estimated $1 billion to a new high of $10.66 billion from its previous value of $9.67 billion. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows The reasons for this remarkable rise have been the subject of heated speculation among many members of the crypto community. One of the more intriguing current theories is on the potential integration of DOGE, the disputed cryptocurrency, into the source code of Tesla&#8217;s website&#8217;s payment page. DOGE market cap currently at $11.8 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Price Boom Soon? As enthusiasts and investors alike anticipate the potential effects of such a development, this notion has been spreading. The mere possibility of DOGE becoming a payment option for Tesla has sparked curiosity and led to upbeat predictions for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future. If Elon Musk does truly integrate DOGE payments into his X app, Dogecoin will experience a solid increase in utility and acceptance, as well as a significant price boom.
