However, having an NFT collection means you also have an engaging community of NFT holders  making a great start to building a community for a game.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This is why some of the successful games on Cronos launched an NFT collection and built their community from there.</p></blockquote><p>Qiang says that crypto gaming has two main routes: First one is the Web3 route, starting with the NFT collection to build an engaging community. Then the community becomes passionate about the collection and wants to see more utility for those NFTs.</p><p>The second route involves established Web2 IPs and their established user base. At some point, the studio might want to add some Web3 elements to their IP. Cronos Labs is helping a number of mobile game studios to incorporate Web3 components into traditional games.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Its quite challenging for them. Its not like chucking NFTs into an established title or creating a token inside the game  its way more complicated than that.</p></blockquote><p>The reaction of Web2 gamers might not be what the studio expects in such cases. They might not like the idea of having NFTs or tokens in a game they like, according to Qiang.</p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-human-digital-souls-agi-alignment-problem-replika/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Experts want to give AI human souls so they dont kill us all</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Bitcoin is on a collision course with Net Zero promises</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>Presentation also plays a key role in the acceptance rate of the community.

The executives spoke on the state of digital assets, blockchain and metaverse adoption in Indonesia. </p><p>According to Sabandar, the country’s youth comprise a large percentage of its population of 270 million, which is a demographic that is “adaptive to new technology.” The executive also pointed out that because of this, the country has been one of the largest userbases in the world when it comes to Web2 social media applications like Facebook and Instagram. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/ca14b92e-f189-4c97-89ed-2716229a00f8.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sabandar delivers a keynote speech at the Blockchain Economy Summit held in Le Meridien, Dubai.

She explained: </p><blockquote>“That’s our homework, actually. To really educate people about the benefit of using blockchain, about the transparency, how smart contracts can benefit their businesses, what is decentralization, things like that.”</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Nugraha, who works as an adviser for the Indonesian government when it comes to its research on blockchain and metaverse technologies, said that the government’s approach to Web3 technology is very collaborative.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/6eddbd06-b140-44a4-b44c-23903451de77.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nugraha (second right) with Cointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra (right) in a panel discussion at the WOW Summit held in Atlantis, The Royal in Dubai.

According to the executive, the government will test the use of blockchain-based digital certificates for land ownership and certificates of competencies for the education sector. </p><p>He believes that with blockchain’s inherent features, implementing the technology on certificates can potentially combat certificate fraud and help the government verify the authenticity of various kinds of digital certificates using on-chain data. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/chinas-blockchain-satellite-in-space-hong-kongs-mcnuggets-metaverse-asia-express/\"><strong><em>China’s blockchain satellite in space, Hong Kong’s McNuggets Metaverse: Asia Express</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "The XRP price continues to trade sideways on low timeframes as the crypto market faces a spike in selling pressure. While major cryptocurrencies will likely bleed into critical support, one analyst believes there is hope for the XRP Ledger native token. Related Reading: ADA Price Hints At Potential Correction, Buy The Dip? As of this writing, the XRP price trades below the critical psychological level of around $0.5 and stands at $0.47 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, XRP was one of the worst performers, recording a 9% loss. Bitcoin Dominance Declines, XRP Price Will Come Out On Top? A pseudonym analyst on social media platform X recently shared a chart showing a decline in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric measures the amount of the total crypto market capitalization represented by BTC. When the Bitcoin Dominance declines, the altcoin sector benefits as the metric suggests investors could move away from the number one crypto into other assets. The analyst indicated that the BTC.D stands at a critical level, facing substantial resistance. In that sense, the metric could return below 50% of the total crypto market cap. The last time the BTC.D stood at current levels, the XRP price rallied above two major obstacles at $0.60 and then at $0.70. The analyst stated: $BTC.D Got to the level where the $XRP Lawsuit win news came out. This caused a big altcoin rally at the time and also marked the 2023 top so far for $BTC and many other coins. Altcoin Season Looming? But Something Needs To Get Out Of The Way According to this analysis, an altcoin season might be on the horizon for the XRP price and other similar cryptocurrencies. However, the analyst believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to decide on the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The narrative around this financial product has been gaining influence on the nascent sector, and if the SEC approves it, there will be much less uncertainty around the nascent sector. In the last 24 hours, some movement has been around the spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ETHGate Rumors: Did Ethereum Bribe The SEC To Go After XRP? This movement coincides with a spike in volatility across the board and could set the stage for fresh news that will trigger the altcoin season or push the XRP price back to critical levels. On the possibility of the SEC approving the ETF, the best scenario for XRP and other token, expert Eric Balchunas said: (…) very poss there will be a few back and forths with SEC on these small but imp details. So I would not say approval imminent but I would say the fact that issuers are in a &#8220;back and forth&#8221; w SEC on this is hugely positive IMO.
