Coinbase currently faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as scrutiny from 10 state regulators, many of whom issued cease and desist orders on the exchange’s staking services.</p><p>The Coinbase CEO reportedly said leaving the U.S. was “not even in the realm of possibility right now” and there was no “break glass plan” — likely referring to what the exchange would do in the event of an emergency. However, at a fintech event in London in April, Armstrong reportedly said the exchange <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-may-face-years-long-court-battle-with-sec-ceo-warns-report\">might consider relocating</a> its headquarters from the U.S. to a more crypto-friendly country due to the lack of regulatory clarity.

Coinbase’s legal team <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-violated-due-process-coinbase-chief-legal-officer-motion-dismiss-lawsuit\">filed a motion</a> to dismiss the lawsuit on Aug. 4, claiming the commission had “violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws”.</p><p>The outcome of the SEC’s case against Coinbase could have far reaching implications for crypto firms operating the United States. In July, a federal judge ruled in the commission’s lawsuit against Ripple that XRP <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">was largely not a security</a> by SEC standards.
