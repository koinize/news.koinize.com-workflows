As per stated by trustees, the clawback is expected to affect 2% of Celsius customers who collectively withdrew 40% of the firm's assets at the eleventh hour before its bankruptcy filing. </p><p>The committee will offer clawback-affected customers a \"favorable rate” if they decide to settle, with the threat of litigation if funds are not returned. In addition, customers who settle will have their notional digital assets adjusted based on their July 2022 value, near the nadir of the crypto bear market, allowing them to keep whatever capital appreciation resultant from the market recovery.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-seeks-claw-back-2-billion-customer-withdrawals\">Read more</a></p></p>\n                \n            "

    "description": "In a bold forecast that is stirring considerable attention within the SHIB community, a prominent official from the Shiba Inu ecosystem has projected a staggering 250% surge in the token&#8217;s value leading up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, expressed her confidence in a significant rebound for SHIB, predicting that the meme coin could surpass its 2021 all-time high (ATH) in the weeks ahead. This optimistic outlook comes despite the token&#8217;s recent 43% decline to $0.000026 from its recent yearly high at $0.000045. Lucie shared her personal investment move on X, revealing her purchase of SHIB during the recent dip at around $0.000024, amounting to $989.08. She dubbed this strategy &#8220;Bought the DIP, my lovely SHIB,&#8221; showcasing her belief in a strong move for the meme coin. With SHIB currently trading at $0.000026, a 70% decrease from its ATH of $0.00008845, the crypto must experience a swift and significant rally of 250% to achieve its previous peak.

Lucie&#8217;s confidence may be mirrored in another daring prediction by the Shiba Inu team on X, where they assert SHIB&#8217;s potential to eclipse Dogecoin in market capitalization through strategic moves referred to as &#8220;Secret Wags.&#8221; Reacting to CryptoCom&#8217;s classification of SHIB as the second most valuable meme-inspired project, the Shiba Inu team hinted at a future where SHIB dethrones DOGE, stating, &#8220;[Number] 2 today, but the Doge days are numbered.&#8221; The competition between SHIB and DOGE is not new; both tokens have vied for dominance in the past. DOGE currently holds the #10 spot in market cap among all cryptocurrencies, with SHIB trailing closely at #11. The market cap gap between DOGE and SHIB stands at $4.14 billion, with DOGE boasting a market cap of $19.41 billion compared to SHIB&#8217;s $15.27 billion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Suffers 40% Crash, What Does This Mean For Price? To reach a new all-time high against its competitor, DOGE, SHIB would need to rally another 50% (SHIB/DOGE), building on the 98% gain against DOGE over the last four weeks. Despite previous attempts to surpass Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu team remains undeterred, buoyed by the growing utility of the Shiba Inu ecosystem beyond its meme coin origins. The development of Shibarium, a blockchain platform offering various utilities for crypto development, and the rallying support of the #ShibaArmy, underline the team&#8217;s determination. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the #ShibaArmy, #Shibarium, and secret wags we can&#8217;t reveal yet.
