The function targets application programming interface (API) traders, who set up specific programs to execute trades automatically with an exchange's trading engine.</p><p>Self-trading occurs when an API user or a group of related users trade with themselves, intentionally or unintentionally. The STP enables API traders to avoid accidental self-trading transactions, helping users prevent unnecessary fees associated with such transactions.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-wash-trading-report\"><strong><em>Decentralized exchanges a magnet for crypto wash traders: Solidus Labs</em></strong></a></p><p>“Without STP, unintentional self-trading could happen in a competitive marketplace. For example, when orders from separate trading units of the same firm, using the same unique UID, with unrelated trading strategies, happen to post orders that trade with each other,” Binance said.</p><p>While unintentional self-trading transactions are handled through the STP, intentional self-trades are prohibited on the exchange. “When self-trading is done intentionally to create an illusion of trading activity, it can be considered a form of market manipulation,” Binance wrote, adding:</p><blockquote>“Our market surveillance team actively monitors market activity to identify intentional self-trading and any other forms of market manipulation. Binance has extensive tools to track intentional self-trading and investigate offenders.”</blockquote><p>As previously mentioned, Binance <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-futures-launches-self-trade-prevention-stp-function-for-usd%E2%93%A2-margined-futures-on-api-32916877372243d69154c345200e34b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">integrated</a> the STP feature for USD-margined futures on API in August 2023. “The STP function is optional and only takes effect when users enable it,” Binance noted.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/minecraft-bans-bitcoin-play-earn-iphone-15-crypto-gaming-formulae-preview-web3-gamer/\"><strong><em>Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 &amp; crypto gaming, For</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
