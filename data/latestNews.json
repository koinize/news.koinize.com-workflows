The suit was brought by Nir Lahav, who is identified only as a California resident.¬†</p><p>At issue are posts made by Zhao on Twitter (now X) in early November on the eve of FTX‚Äôs collapse. The posts were made in conjunction with the decision by the defendants to liquidate their holdings in the FTX utility token FTT on Nov. 6. The plaintiffs estimated that Binance owned up to 5% of all FTT tokens. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/7986cab2-32f0-44ca-9c28-411dece73af9.png\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Suit filed against Binance and Changpeng Zhao.

In terms of performance, it&#8217;s no news Ethereum (ETH) has followed behind BTC in the past few years. However, according to crypto analyst Dave the Wave, Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming years.¬† A Different Perspective Dave the Wave took to social media to share his views on the Ethereum/Bitcoin price action. The current trajectory shows Ethereum has been falling against Bitcoin in terms of performance since the beginning of the year.¬† Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? A more in-depth examination reveals that Ethereum has been following a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a continued downward trend.

The current situation shows the formation of this wedge might be nearing its end which indicates a decrease in downside momentum and a potential trend reversal.¬† This possible reversal is reiterated by the Fibonacci indicator, which shows the downward trend is at the 0.236 level. Can Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin? Ethereum has frequently outperformed Bitcoin for periods stretching months at a time. The ecosystem also has a few key advantages over BTX that could help it outperform in the coming years.¬† Although Bitcoin still reigns as the top cryptocurrency, Ethereum seems poised to gain more mainstream traction in the coming years. As more projects and blockchains are built and connected to the Ethereum network, we could see Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of performance as early as next year.
