In addition, employees face a 50% cut to their base salary. A message allegedly from Bitmain reads: </p><blockquote>\"For the month of September, the company has yet to achieve a net positive cash flow, especially in the orders of [new] ASICs. The Executive Management Team therefore decided that salaries for the month of September will be paused, to be reviewed after October 7 after the holiday.\"</blockquote><p>Founded in Beijing, China, in 2013, Bitmain is one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturers, with an estimated 70% market share during its peak. The firm's Antminer ASIC series currently leads the industry in terms of hash rate computations for mining Bitcoin.</p><p>In August, Bitcoin miner Hive <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retransmission-hive-digital-announces-quarterly-100000594.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the purchase of 2,000 Bitmain S19 XP ASIC miners for immediate deployment in its rigs. The S19XP ASIC miners have a listed price of $4,653 on Bitmain. Hive says that after its integrations, the firm's mining rigs will generate a combined $80 per megawatt hour in revenue, including both old and non-Bitmain models. </p><p>In 2021, Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, <a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/tardis/zm/art/355564624?source_id=1003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the settlement of a year-long ownership dispute with co-founder Micree Zhan. Under the agreement, Wu would resign as chairman and CEO of Bitmain, and sell his ownership stake to Zhan for $600 million. At the time, Bitmain planned for an initial public offering at a $5 billion valuation by late-2022. Such plans are believed to have been shelved due to the ongoing bear market.</p><p><strong>Magazine: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/3ac-opnx-asia-express/\">3AC fugitives in disarray as OPNX faces new peril</a></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
