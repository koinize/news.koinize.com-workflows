    "description": "Solana-based memecoin BONK has enjoyed a rally of more than 18% today, but the asset may be in trouble if this sell signal is to go by. BONK Has Formed A TD Sequential Sell Signal On Its Weekly Chart As explained by analyst Ali in a post on X, the same indicator that signaled the latest rally for BONK is now predicting a decline for the cryptocurrency instead. The metric in question is the &#8220;Tom Demark (TD) Sequential,&#8221; which is generally used for pinpointing probable tops and bottoms in any asset&#8217;s price. The indicator gives such a reversal signal after nine candles of the same type are following a previous top/bottom in the asset. This nine-candle phase is called the &#8220;setup.&#8221; Related Reading: 63.2% Of PEPE Holders Now In Profit: How This Compares With DOGE, SHIB If the setup completes with nine red candles, then the TD Sequential suggests a likely buying point, while green candles imply the asset might have encountered a top. A TD Sequential setup has been completed for memecoin BONK on its weekly price chart just recently. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern in the cryptocurrency: Looks like the signal has completed with green candles recently &#124; Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the weekly BONK price has completed a TD Sequential setup phase with green candles recently as the asset has been enjoying a sharp rally. Ali notes that a few months ago, the same indicator had presented a buy signal for the meme coin, which ended up leading to the current rally. So far, the asset has enjoyed profits of more than 8,400% during this run. The analyst thinks based on the latest TD Sequential sell signal, BONK may be heading towards a correction period that could last anywhere from one to four weeks. The Dog-Based Coin Has Registered A Rise Of Over 18% During The Past Day During the weekend, BONK continued its recent bullish momentum and made a push above the $0.00001487 mark, but the meme coin soon noticed a sharp correction as it plunged to $0.00000996. The bulls appear to be back for the coin, though, as it has seen a rapid 18% recovery in the last 24 hours, reclaiming the $0.00001237 level. The below chart shows how the token has performed during the past month. The price of the asset appears to have gone through a sharp rally in this period &#124; Source: BONKUSD on TradingView BONK is still a decent distance from making a full retrace towards its top, however, so it&#8217;s hard to say anything about whether this fresh rally is going to last for any sizeable period. Related Reading: Hold Your Horses: Bitcoin Could Fall Back To Under $38,000, These Analysts Say And given the TD Sequential sell signal in the weekly chart, it&#8217;s possible that this recovery surge is just a dead-cat bounce, and BONK will be heading down from here instead. At present, the meme coin is up more than 364% during the past month and stands third on the top meme coins by market cap list, meaning that it&#8217;s only smaller than Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in total valuation.
