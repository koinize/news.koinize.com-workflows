But it was slowly becoming clear that the Plasma technology it was pursuing was not the answer the market was looking for.</p><p>Ideas around scaling had begun to change, and Plasmas <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/plasma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >shortcomings</a> (TLDR: complicated, better at transferring assets than running smart contracts) had seen it lose favor. Seeing which way the wind was blowing, the research-oriented Plasma Group decided to ditch the framework altogether in favor of building an Optimstic rollup and renamed the project Optimism in early 2020.</p><p>But the Matic Network <a href=\"https://github.com/maticnetwork/whitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >white paper</a> had outlined a Plasma-based solution with fraud proofs and a proof-of-stake checkpoint layer, and the team was determined to follow through and build it in 2019 and 2020, despite waning interest in the tech.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Illustration of Sandeep Nailwal within the framework of the NFT top 100 Blockchain person project by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Minterest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >@Minterest</a>  I will post on Behance the whole project on Monday! <a href=\"https://t.co/09rTXRABnA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/09rTXRABnA</a></p>— Dlanid (@DlaniD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DlaniD/status/1479924678336655370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >January 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mainnet-market-crash-and-resurrection\">Mainnet market crash and resurrection</h2><p>Just as the project was gearing up to launch its mainnet in May 2020, a worldwide pandemic and the March Black Thursday market crash intervened. Around 70% was wiped off the already paltry sub-3-cent price of MATIC within the space of 10 days. With fears of a new Great Depression gripping the world, Matic Networks future again looked in doubt.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Suddenly, everything felt like it will go to zero. That shock was there for two to three months. We survived that, but what we realized is that, you know, we started with Plasma technology, and now plasma is dead. And now we are launching our mainnet. People are, like, Plasma is dead; there is no interest from the community.</p></blockquote><p>Nailwal says the team came to two conclusions.</p><p>The first is theyd try and get as many developers and builders as possible. This was a success, as they launched their Ethereum layer 2 just in time for DeFi Summers ludicrous gas fees on layer 1.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sandeep-at-Token2049-polygon-club-twitter.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandeep at Token2049 polygon club twitter\" class=\"wp-image-25084\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sandeep-at-Token2049-polygon-club-twitter.jpeg 600w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sandeep-at-Token2049-polygon-club-twitter-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Sandeep Nailwal at Token2049.

Nailwal says the projects roots in India meant it had a low profile in the Western world, where some considered it to be just like another internet scam. </p><p><strong><em>Also read: </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-zero-knowledge-voting-finance/\"><strong><em>Beyond crypto  Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance</em></strong></a></p><p>In early 2021, Matic Network rebranded as Polygon to highlight the change in direction. At the time, Nailwal told Cointelegraph the idea was to become <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/matic-rebrands-to-polygon-in-pursuit-of-polkadot-on-ethereum-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Polkadot on Ethereum</a> and to add Optimistic rollups, zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups and StarkWare-style Validiums alongside the PoS network.</p><p>But Nailwal says they quickly realized that Optimistic rollups were at best an intermediate solution that wouldnt be able to scale up to have 50 chains working in the ecosystem.</p><p>With ZK, you can imagine a world with […] 100,000 chains; each of them has 1,000 transactions per second (TPS); all of them combined together could be tens of millions of TPS in the whole network. And the architecture will still survive and keep scaling.</p><p>Infinite scalability, unified liquidity and that is the main point for why we bet on ZK because ZK is the endgame for blockchain scaling.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">LOL <a href=\"https://t.co/VrzFbeD5m7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >pic.twitter.com/VrzFbeD5m7</a></p>— Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon  (@sandeepnailwal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1700798303250870781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >September 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Polygon bull-run fever</h2><p>At the dawn of 2021, MATICs market cap was just $87 million.

The project became Polygon Hermez, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible ZK solution focused on decentralization and a proof-of-efficiency consensus.</p><p>In December, it spent another $400 million in MATIC to buy the <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-takes-a-major-lead-in-zk-rollups-welcomes-mir-a-groundbreaking-zk-startup-in-a-400m-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Mir</a> team of ZK-proof experts to build Polygon Zero (ZK recursive scaling).

(But) the talent in number three, four, five teams is super, super good.</p><p>The venture capital seemed to think the new plan was a winner, with Polygon raising another $450 million in early 2022, selling MATIC tokens in a raise led by Sequoia Capital India and including Tiger Global and Softbank Vision Fund.</p><p>The advantages of having multiple teams taking different approaches became pretty clear.</p><p>We initially kept them completely autonomous so they could pursue their own research, and they collaborated with each other.

For his part, Nailwal thinks EVM will win in the short term, but other solutions will come into their own in the years ahead.</p><p>I almost feel like EVM is like JavaScript right? he says. I remember when I was in first or second year of my engineering college JavaScript was considered to be a programming language of the midwits! But today, JS is everywhere; maybe 80% of the web is powered by JavaScript. So, EVM kind of has those effects no matter how much you say, These are the problems.</p><p>Nailwal adds, however, Our plan is a 10-year-long plan. So, we have the ZK EVMs, we have Polygon Zero, but we also have Polygon Miden, which we believe is highly performant, has privacy features inbuilt […] and it will support all the programming languages.</p><p>Miden founder Bobbin Threadbare told Magazine earlier this year that the Miden VM will enable users to do things like run high-quality video games and generate ZK-proofs on their home PCs they can send into the network.</p><p>What they are doing, it gives me goosebumps, Nailwal says. But Miden will start blossoming in around one year. By that time, we, as the Polygon community, need to win the ZK EVM.

So, not a huge advantage, but its going to reduce the (gas) cost of the transactions.</p><p>Full danksharding, which is several years away, <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/#current-progress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >according</a> to the Ethereum Foundation, however, will multiply that improvement by the number of shards, currently expected at around 64.</p><p>So, you can imagine that 64 multiplied by 200.
