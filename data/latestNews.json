The centralized nature of the video streaming ecosystem allows for opaque distribution and lets platforms capture the vast majority of the revenue, leaving minimal value for video creators.</p><p>Although companies – ranging from talent agencies to tech projects – exist to broker and license content on behalf of the creator, they fail to track revenue accurately and mostly rely on manual record-keeping.
