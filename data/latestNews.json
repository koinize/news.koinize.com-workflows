    "description": "Cryptocurrency expert and analyst Doctor Profit has identified regions that are vital for Bitcoin (BTC) presently, which could possibly propel the crypto asset&#8217;s price to unprecedented heights at a very fast pace. For the most part, the cryptocurrency community is concerned about the way that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has performed during the last week. Nonetheless, Doctor Profit&#8217;s latest weekly update on the crypto market and Bitcoin has provided optimism for investors within the crypto space. Bitcoin For A Massive Leg Up To $100,000 In his analysis, Doctor Profit explores the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), psychological analysis, and technical analysis (TA) of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance.  Drawing attention to the previous Sunday report, the analyst predicted a sideways movement for Bitcoin in the longer term. However, the largest cryptocurrency asset is currently moving in the indicated sideways region, as he points out. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Real Pump’ Nears New All-Time Highs, Analyst Says The expert claims that some people are unable to see the wider picture playing out within the sideways movement. Due to this, they fail to understand that price fluctuations in the 20% range are normal and even beneficial for moves in big market caps.  Thus, Bitcoin is preparing for its next big move, which will push prices over $80,000 and hit $100,000 at high speed. He noted that this bullish sideways movement is referred to as an accumulation area in trading terminology.  During this stage, a convergence of profit-taking, incoming investment, and undecided money, practically leads to a mid-term consolidation. Consequently, he is bullish about the sideways trend and anticipates a looming upward surge.  Furthermore, Doctor Profit underscored the significance of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above its previous all-time high (ATH) of $69,000, and the necessity of exercising patience as the coin consolidates close to its peak level. He stated: What many fail to understand is that Bitcoin just broke through its all-time high (ATH) in the last few weeks and is now slowly building support near the ATH region. People don&#8217;t realize that this is a process that takes weeks. Doctor Profit asserts that before continuing to rise and entering the super cycle, the market would spend weeks in the area of the Golden Bull. &#8220;After confirmation at $72,500, it won&#8217;t be long until BTC rises beyond $70,000 and enters the super cycle,&#8221; he added. Recent Retest Pattern Aligns With Past Trends Doctor Profit seems to be pleased with Bitcoin retesting its previous ATH level in the $60,000 range. He highlights the potential of Bitcoin and the slow transformation of the $60,000 resistance level into a solid support point, paving the way for the upcoming super cycle similar to other ATH breakouts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip Expected: Will BTC Rally Before US Fed Decision? &#8220;Bitcoin now appears mature enough to withstand this pressure at $60,000 and maintain its above-average price without any difficulty,&#8221; he stated. Despite ongoing corrections, the analyst has urged investors to be confident, citing the Bitcoin Halving as a catalyst for an impending upward surge.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-2-3-billion/",
    "description": "Bitcoin whales have been very active in the past few days as the crypto continues to trade below $68,000. Notably, on-chain data has shown a trend of accumulation among Bitcoin whales, with large bouts of the cryptocurrency leaving crypto exchanges into private wallets.  These massive transfers appear to have piqued the interest of a few investors who are keeping a watchful eye, as this accumulation pattern points to a price increase up ahead.  According to various posts by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, Bitcoin whales have recently transferred $2.3 billion worth of BTC in a span of 24 hours, indicating their bullish sentiment. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over 25,000 BTC worth approximately $1.60 billion had been transferred into accumulation addresses. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Signal Price Surge Ahead Bitcoin has largely traded below $69,000 since March 15, struggling to regain the momentum that saw it shooting past $70,000 earlier in the month. Interestingly, Bitcoin fell to as low as $61,766 last week, representing a 16% decline from its all-time high.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw consistent outflows throughout the week which was spearheaded by Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC and weak inflows into BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC. This decline became much of a concern for investors as it signaled the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC might finally be coming to an end. However, on-chain data is now telling a different tale of a strong bullish sentiment from Bitcoin whales. Data from Whale Alerts show large amounts of BTC leaving crypto exchanges, one of which was a transfer of 8,136 BTC worth $517 million from Coinbase into a new private wallet. Shortly after, 8,172 BTC worth $519 million were transferred from Coinbase into another new private wallet. Interestingly, the different alerts from the whale tracker added up to $2.3 billion worth of BTC to and from crypto exchanges on March 22.  Analyst Ali Martinez noted that these transfers added up to $1.6 billion being added into accumulation addresses, the largest inflow so far this year.  Yesterday, over 25,000 #Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.60 billion, were transferred to accumulation addresses, marking the highest inflow to these $BTC wallets so far this year! pic.twitter.com/mAIHkG9ROC — Ali (@ali_charts) March 23, 2024 According to CryptoQuant data, this accumulation trend has seen the Bitcoin reserves on exchanges on a downtrend since March 21. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin exchange reserve is at 1.98 million BTC.  Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Notable Rise In Daily Activity, But Why Is Price Down? Basically, whale accumulation tends to swing the balance into bullish among other traders. Fundamentals surrounding Bitcoin like the upcoming halving point to price growth in the near future, making it an ideal time for investors to position themselves in the market.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,478. A key price level to watch is $69,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher with the accumulation trend.
