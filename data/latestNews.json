    "description": "In a recent development, the Avalanche (AVAX) C-Chain encountered a significant disruption in block production, leading to a halt for over one hour. The interruption, which affected the primary network, was observed through the Avascan browser, with the last transaction recorded at block 42046853 (19:13 UTC+8). Although other subnets experienced a slight delay, the primary network faced the most substantial impact. Avalanche C-Chain Block Production Halt Ava Labs, the team behind the Avalanche protocol, acknowledged the issue and promptly initiated an investigation. According to Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder of Avalanche, the disruption is believed to be related to a new inscription wave that was launched approximately an hour before the block production interruption.  Sekniqi expressed confidence that the incident was caused by an “esoteric bug” stemming from an untested edge case, emphasizing the need for a swift resolution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts Near-Term Surge To $61,000 The disruption is presumed to be associated with a mempool handling issue specifically tied to inscriptions, which encountered untested edge cases. When questioned about the possibility of such untested scenarios arising, Sekniqi acknowledged that while ideally, there should be no untested edge cases, the vastness of the codebase and continuous updates make it challenging to anticipate every possible scenario.  The Avalanche co-founder further clarified that thorough testing is conducted on testnets, but the intricacies of the mainnet environment can introduce “unforeseen challenges.” At present, no further official statement has been issued by the Avalanche protocol, awaiting additional reports and updates from the development team to gain further insights into the situation.  AVAX Price Dips During the occurrence of the block production halt, the AVAX price, which serves as the native token of the Avalanche protocol, exhibited a negative reaction, further extending the ongoing decline observed since Thursday when the price was at $43. Related Reading: Arbitrum In Freefall, Dips Below $2 As Experts Analyze Recovery Timelines As of now, the AVAX price has reached $36.13, indicating a decline of over 2% within the past 24 hours, accompanied by a substantial drop of 11.7% over the course of the previous seven days. The subsequent actions taken by the Avalanche team in response to this situation, as well as the consequential effect on the AVAX price, are yet to be determined.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/siacoin-balloons-to-65-in-value-on-network-upgrades-details/",
    "description": "Siacoin (SC), the native token of the decentralized cloud storage platform Sia, has been on a tear in recent months, defying expectations and leaving investors wondering if the rocket ride can continue. After reaching a low of $0.0025 in mid-September 2023, the price skyrocketed a staggering 360% to peak at $0.0130 by January 24, 2024. While a 30% correction followed, wiping out those gains, the story didn&#8217;t end there. Siacoin defied bearish predictions, embarking on a new upward trajectory culminating in a new high of $0.0175 on February 21st, marking over 100% increase from its January low. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Run: Analyst Eyes $4,500 After ETH Breached $3K SC price up in the daily and weekly timeframes. Source: Coingecko Unpacking The Surge: Technical Advancements, Community Optimism So, what&#8217;s fueling Siacoin&#8217;s unexpected rise? Several factors contribute to the narrative. Firstly, the February 2024 update unveiled significant advancements in the Sia network, focusing on stability, performance, and user experience. These include the implementation of RHP4 for the upcoming Utreexo hardfork, aiming to boost efficiency and scalability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wallets Bleed: 730K Investors Exit Despite Record $7 Billion ETF Inflows Additionally, new features like metadata addition and improved upload processes enhance data management and user interaction. The Siacoin community, excited about these technical developments, saw them as a sign of progress and fueled further investment. SCUSD trading at $0.0147 on the daily chart: TradingView.com However, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge the broader market context. Siacoin&#8217;s price rise coincided with a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, with many digital assets experiencing significant gains. This suggests that investor sentiment played a significant role in the token&#8217;s upward trajectory. Meanwhile, there has been a significant rise in short liquidations as a result of the SC token boom. The volume of shorts liquidations increased to above $40k on Wednesday, the highest amount in a month, according to data provided by CoinGlass. Source: Coinglass Charting The Course: Bullish Breakout Or Bearish Divergence? Technical analysis paints a somewhat complex picture. While the price broke out of a long-lasting consolidation zone, potentially signaling the start of a larger bull cycle, a bearish divergence emerges when comparing the current rise with the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). This discrepancy indicates that the price action might not have enough momentum to sustain itself in the short term. SC price action in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko On the other hand, some analysts see this potential correction as a healthy retracement after the rapid ascent, retesting broken support levels before continuing its upward journey. This perspective aligns with the larger uptrend that began in October 2023, suggesting that a first bull market correction is underway, paving the way for further growth later in 2024. Beyond The Numbers: Adoption And Future Catalysts Looking beyond technical analysis, Siacoin&#8217;s future hinges on its real-world adoption and development roadmap. The platform boasts a growing user base and partnerships, indicating increased demand for its decentralized storage solutions. Upcoming events like the Utreexo hardfork and potential regulatory developments could also act as significant catalysts, influencing the price in either direction.
