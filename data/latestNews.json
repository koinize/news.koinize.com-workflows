Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting the Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.</p>\n                    <p><p>Ripple Labs scored a major win in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with XRP deemed as not a security when sold on digital asset exchanges. However, some lawyers argue an appeal is possible, and that it may not necessarily help in cases against Binance and Coinbase. Meanwhile, the former CEO of Celsius has been arrested and has reportedly been released on bail. </p><h2>Binance layoffs mount amid DOJ investigation</h2><p>Binance has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-headcount-reduction-hits-1-000-employees-report\">reportedly laid off over 1,000 workers</a> in recent weeks, as the cryptocurrency exchange grapples with regulatory challenges and a United States Justice Department investigation. </p><p>On July 14, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Changpeng Zhao-led exchange could lose more than a third of its staff as layoffs continue. Sources indicated that service workers, particularly in India, experienced the brunt of the job cuts. Zhao has referred to the reported layoff figures as \"FUD.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As we continuously strive to increase talent density, there are involuntary terminations.

The company has since faced regulatory obstacles in key European markets. </p><p>On May 31, Binance said it would be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-plans-new-round-of-layoffs-to-address-increased-regulatory-scrutiny\">laying off 20% of its staff</a> but referred to the measures as resource allocation instead of downsizing. A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the exchange was preparing “for the next major bull cycle” and was shuffling resources accordingly. </p><h3>XRP tops Bitcoin on Upbit with $2.6B of trading volume in 24 hours</h3><p>Trading volume of XRP <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP$0.79</a> tokens on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has surpassed Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC$31,207</a> in the past 24 hours. The XRP/KRW trading pair saw $2.6 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours following Ripple’s partial win against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its long-running court battle.</p><p>The XRP buying frenzy saw the token account for 46% of all trading volume on Upbit, followed by Bitcoin with just 5% of the total share. XRP led the bullish momentum in the crypto market in the past 24 hours, helping other altcoins hit double-digit surges.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-07/aa7e9445-6c0f-4307-a54a-9c49ec439fde.png\"  /></figure><p>The buying frenzy was not just limited to South Korea. XRP price saw a 92% surge on July 13, reaching a new one-year high of $0.91. This surge helped XRP to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-xrp-price-market-cap-jumps-sec-ruling\">climb to fourth place</a> in the crypto market cap rankings. Within hours of the court ruling, XRP’s market cap soared by as much as $21.2 billion to reach a new yearly high of $46.1 billion.</p><p>On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">issued a summary judgment</a> in favor of Ripple Labs, ruling that the XRP token is not a security. However, the ruling refers only to the token’s sales on digital asset exchanges. The judgment was greeted with relief by the XRP community, as the SEC lawsuit filed in 2020 forced several crypto exchanges in the U.S. to delist the XRP token. Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Gemini and other exchanges <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-exchanges-second-chance-xrp-listings-after-court-ruling\">have already announced</a> relisting plans.</p><p>The crypto community celebrated the win, with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-holders-celebrate-ripple-win-victory-sec-case\">many describing it as a watershed moment</a>, while others cautioned it was only a partial victory. Stephen Palley, a lawyer, noted that the summary judgment is only partial and that the ruling by Torres may not set a precedent. He also reminded the crypto community that the SEC may very well appeal the judgment.</p><h3>XRP ruling a ‘watershed moment’ but don’t celebrate yet</h3><p>Ripple Labs’ <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">split-decision victory</a> against the United States securities regulator is being seen as a significant blow to the regulator’s “war on crypto,” however, crypto lawyers warn it isn't a definitive victory for the industry.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Ripple ruling today decimates the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SECGov</a>&#39;s case against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@coinbase</a>.
