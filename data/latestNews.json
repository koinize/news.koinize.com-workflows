Zhu, a Singaporean national, was sentenced to four months in prison for the breach. </p><p>Teneo, the appointed liquidator for 3AC, said in an email statement that creditors would seek to engage with him on matters relating to 3AC, focusing on the recovery of assets that are either the property of 3AC or that have been acquired using 3ACs funds during his time in prison. <br><br>The liquidators will pursue all opportunities to ensure Mr. Zhu complies in full with the court order made against him for provision of information and documents relating to 3AC and its former investment manager during the course of his imprisonment and thereafter, Teneo wrote. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"3AC co-founder Kyle Davies (Left) and Su Zhu (Right)\" class=\"wp-image-18622\" width=\"830\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fs8G3mZWIAAKcF1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">3AC co-founders Kyle Davies (Left) and Su Zhu (Right).

The event caused a chain reaction that led to the bankruptcy of 3ACs counterparties, such as Celsius, Voyager and FTX.

The platform launched in April with just <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/zhu-sus-exchange-did-13-64-in-volume-akshually-huobi-in-crisis-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >$13.64 in trading volume</a> on its debut.

On the day of the announcement, the Open Exchange Token fell nearly 60% in a single day to $0.01. The token has lost 79% of its value in the past month and has a fully diluted market capitalization of just $77 million, compared with over <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-admin/post.php?post=21338&action=edit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >$300 million in June</a>. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/north-korean-crypto-hacking-separating-fact-from-fiction/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>North Korean crypto hacking: Separating fact from fiction</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/why-join-blockchain-gaming-guild-fun-profit-help-create-games/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Why join a blockchain gaming guild?

Per design, claims would be converted into collateral in the form of OPNXs native reborn OX (reOX) tokens or oUSD, its credit currency. Users could then trade crypto futures using reOX as collateral. <br><br>However, the firms claims dashboard remains dysfunctional at the time of publication. Leslie Lamb, OPNXs CEO, had tried to distance the firm from Davies and Zhu, claiming that they are no longer involved in [its] operations. In August, all three executives were fined the equivalent of $2.7 million by Dubais Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority for running OPNX as an unlicensed exchange in the Emirate. </p><p>Prior to Zhus arrest, 3AC Ventures, a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-three-arrows-capital-founders-launch-new-vc-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >venture capital fund</a> created by the duo in June, appeared to be doing quite well. Its investments have since expanded to a project called Gamerlan since its initial investment in Raise. 3AC Ventures is focused on superior risk-adjusted returns without leverage, its creators proclaimed. </p><p>Regardless, creditors have made it clear that their priority is in recovering the assets of 3AC and maximising returns for its creditors, which could also include former 3AC assets that are used to create new entities. Teneo has since <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/real-reason-chinas-war-on-crypto-3ac-judges-embarrassing-mistake-asia-express/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >recovered several nonfungible tokens</a> owned by 3AC and auctioned them via Sothebys, netting a total of $13.4 million. The proceedings are still ongoing. </p><div class=\"subscribe subscribe--inner\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"subscribe__inner\"><div class=\"subscribe__content\">    <div class=\"subscribe__title display2\">Subscribe</div>    <div class=\"subscribe__desc text-l\">The most engaging reads in blockchain.
