    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/matic-analysis/celo-considers-transitioning-to-ethereum-layer-2-with-polygon-chain/",
    "description": "Celo, a blockchain platform, is exploring migrating from its standalone blockchain to an Ethereum (ETH) Layer-2 (L2) network. Originally, Celo had planned to utilize Optimism&#8217;s OP Stack, a customizable toolkit similar to Polygon (MATIC) but based on Optimism&#8217;s technology.  However, Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs, has proposed an alternative solution to the Celo community. Nailwal suggests leveraging Polygon&#8217;s Chain Development Kit (CDK), an open-source toolset that enables the creation of customizable Layer-2 chains powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. Celo&#8217;s Potential Move To Ethereum Layer-2 Via Polygon In a recent blog post, Polygon Labs suggested Celo could consider deploying an Ethereum Layer-2 solution using Polygon CDK.  According to Polygon Labs co-founder Nailwal, this strategy would allow Celo to leverage the benefits of being an Ethereum Layer-2 platform while preserving the characteristics that have contributed to its success. Related Reading: Why Touching This Bitcoin Level Could Hold The Key For A Rally The proposal emphasizes several key advantages of adopting Polygon CDK. Firstly, it enables cross-community collaboration by integrating with an ecosystem of Layer-2 solutions powered by zero-knowledge technology.  Polygon CDK enhances compatibility with Ethereum by providing an environment equivalent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This alignment ensures a seamless transition for Celo, closely matching Ethereum&#8217;s technical infrastructure and tooling. Furthermore, according to Nailwal, deploying with the protocol&#8217;s CDK offers increased security for Celo. It allows Celo to leverage Ethereum&#8217;s proven consensus layer while incorporating the security benefits of zero-knowledge proofs.  Regarding fees and scalability, Celo can benefit from low fees by utilizing the zkEVM validium architecture and off-chain data availability supported by Polygon CDK. These features contribute to cost-efficient transactions while enabling scalability for Celo&#8217;s network. Moreover, according to Nailwal, Celo gains access to a unified Layer-2 economy by becoming a part of the Polygon ecosystem by combining Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet with Polygon&#8217;s ecosystem. This integration creates a seamless experience for developers and users, facilitating interaction with both networks. Fast Transactions And Lower Fees?  With zero-knowledge technology, Celo users can enjoy near-instant withdrawals, faster finality times, and instant cross-chain interactivity.  According to the blog post, these features enhance the speed, efficiency, and security of transactions, ultimately improving the user experience. Through Polygon CDK, chains can achieve near-instant cross-chain interactivity with Ethereum, leveraging the power of ZK proofs to establish a secure and interconnected network.

Overall, the proposed migration to Polygon CDK represents an opportunity for Celo to transition to an Ethereum Layer-2 solution while harnessing the advantages offered by Polygon&#8217;s ZK-powered technology. The proposal aims to initiate discussions between the Celo and Polygon communities to explore the potential benefits for all stakeholders involved. It is important to note that no final decision has been made at this stage, and the proposal signifies the beginning of discussions between the Celo and Polygon communities.
