According to the investigator, out of the 20 wallets, 17 were created and owned by the infamous criminal organization disguised to represent genuine investors. He revealed that the criminal organization was connected to the CCP, and 98% of Tron‚Äôs total token supply was received by these 17 wallets. The on-chain investigator also mentioned that cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi Global, and cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu may also be linked to the CCP and Wanxiang, a Chinese multinational conglomerate and the team that funded Ethereum Foundation wallets and Ethereum‚Äôs Founder, Vitalik Buterin.¬† ETH prie falls back to mid $1,600s &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Investigations Cast Shadows On Ethereum The crypto industry has experienced a series of Ponzi schemes and rug pulls for years now, causing investors and regulators to be wary of crypto exchanges and organizations in the space.¬† While Tron is faced with speculations of being a well-orchestrated Ponzi scheme and having connections with the CCP, the revelation that Ethereum, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency may be backed by the CCP and connected to companies involved in drug trafficking has left the crypto community in a paradox.¬† According to BoringSleuth, the CCP is allegedly supporting Ethereum and other blockchains as well as multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in the crypto space.¬† The crypto investigator utilized a previous transaction that saw the CCP receiving 133,700 ether on a single Genesis Block address owned by the party, as a reference to a connection between Ethereum and the CCP. BoringSleuth has also stated a potential connection between Ethereum‚Äôs Founders and the CCP, which he said he would be revealing in detail soon.¬† The allegations faced by Tron and Ethereum come amid the increasing scrutiny of China‚Äôs role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Although the crypto X community is presently reeling from the on-chain investigator‚Äôs hypothesis, no concrete evidence linking Ethereum to the CCP has emerged, leaving the allegations in the realm of speculation.
