Here are some of the most colorful observations about the day.</p><h3>Noticeably leaner, signature haircut gone</h3><p>The defendant Sam Bankman-Fried appeared noticeably leaner, according to multiple reports.</p><p>Flanked by five defense lawyers, he was dressed in a navy suit that seemed bigger on him in previous appearances and his signature unkempt curly locks were subbed for a shorter hairstyle. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some of the first court sketches of SBF&#39;s new haircut by Jane Rosenberg for Reuters: <a href=\"https://t.co/n0FqW71PWD\">pic.twitter.com/n0FqW71PWD</a></p>&mdash; Luc Cohen (@cohenluc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cohenluc/status/1709273900020809797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Unchained Crypto’s Laura Shin noted that Bankman-Fried was noticeably “less jittery than normal.”</p><p>“I did not see him shake his leg at all,” she <a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/podcast/sbf-trial-day-1-possible-witnesses-include-ftx-insiders-big-names-in-crypto-and-sbfs-family/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">said</a> in an Oct. 3 podcast. </p><p>The only time he spoke was to say “yes” to the judge and occasionally looked at the jurors. Other times, he conferred with his lawyers or was seen typing and scrolling on his air-gapped laptop. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MY SBF HAIRCUT SKETCH VS COURT GUY  <a href=\"https://t.co/rNC4MC2xRK\">pic.twitter.com/rNC4MC2xRK</a></p>&mdash; Tiffany Fong (@TiffanyFong_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1709340099010281697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>SBF has spent the past seven weeks or so locked up at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre.

Kaplan told the burgeoning crowd of potential jurors “You are to do no research. You are not to read press coverage,” however, he lightened up when it came to questioning the crowd, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-execs-witnesses-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-trial\">reported</a> Cointelegraph. </p><p>Potential jurors were asked if they had prior knowledge about FTX and Alameda, with one saying they learned about it from The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1709343912379191311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">according</a> to a partial transcript from Inner City Press.</p><p>One juror said they worked with a company that invested (and lost money) on FTX and Alameda. Another potential juror said\"</p><blockquote> “I invested in crypto. I lost money.” </blockquote><p>One juror shared he wasn’t sure if he could be unbiased with crypto: “I've felt negatively about it since I learned about it.” He was later dismissed from the pool of potential jurors.</p><p>Another juror even asked the judge whether a death sentence could be imposed for Bankman-Fried, to which the judge answered: </p><blockquote>“We'll get to it in a minute or two and my answer will have to suffice. Anyone unwilling to accept that punishment is up to the court? No one.”</blockquote><p>At the end of the session, Judge Kaplan said “We now have a sufficient group of qualified jurors, 50.” He added that 18 will be selected in total comprising 12 jurors and 6 alternates. </p><p>He added that on the next day (Oct. 4) a microphone will be passed around for each juror to speak for a minute. “Then the lawyers will confer and the final selection will be made,” he concluded. </p><h3>Witnesses for the prosecution</h3><p>An assistant U.S. attorney read out a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-execs-witnesses-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-trial\">list of potential witnesses</a> for the prosecution. This included some expected names such as former company executives like Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, Ryne Miller, Constance Wang, family members Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried and even Anthony Scaramucci.</p><p>Several institutions were also listed including Jane Street Capital, Sequoia Capital, BlockFi, Genesis, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Binance, Nexo, Guarding Against Pandemics (the nonprofit of SBF’s brother), and Voyager Digital.</p><h3>Six-week trial expected </h3><p>Judge Kaplan said that the trial was expected to take <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-trial-schedule\">about six weeks</a>, but he also noted that could be over in a much shorter time.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/sam-bankman-fried-jail-before-ftx-trial\"><strong><em>What has Sam Bankman-Fried been up to in jail?</em></strong></a></p><p>However, by the end of the day, he had not succeeded in finalizing the jury. Kaplan predicted that this would be completed by the morning of Oct. 4, after which both sides are expected to give opening arguments totaling around 90 minutes. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We decided to illustrate the lead-up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SBF_FTX</a>&#39;s trial.

    "description": "Cardano’s price started a fresh decline below $0.264. ADA is struggling and might accelerate lower if there is a close below the $0.250 support. ADA price is gaining bearish momentum below the $0.265 level against the US dollar. The price is trading above $0.250 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.258 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $0.250 support to start a fresh increase in the near term. Cardano Price Trims Gains In the past few days, Cardano’s price climbed higher above the $0.255 level. The price was able to clear the $0.265 resistance, but the upsides were limited. The price traded as high as $0.2741 and recently corrected lower, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.265 support level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.258 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano is now testing the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2426 swing low to the $0.2741 high. However, ADA is still above $0.250 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.258 zone. The first major resistance is forming near the $0.265 zone. The next key resistance might be $0.274. If there is a close above the $0.274 resistance, the price could start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.300 resistance zone. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.265 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.250 level. The next major support is near the $0.242 level. A downside break below the $0.242 level could open the doors for a sharp fresh decline toward $0.220. The next major support is near the $0.200 level. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.250, $0.242, and $0.220. Major Resistance Levels – $0.265, $0.274, and $0.300."
