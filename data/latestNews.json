Other crypto businesses, including digital assets trading platforms, are also subject to the registration requirement. </p><p>The timing of CACEIS' registration allowed the company to avoid new stricter regulations. A new set of rules for digital assets providers in France will take effect in July, demanding firms to comply with tighter Anti-Money Laundering measures, such as ensuring customer funds are segregated, and providing more detailed disclosures about risks and conflicts of interest.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/d89a3c6e-3ebf-4642-845d-fda565c0b253.png\"><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CACEIS Bank registration with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF).
