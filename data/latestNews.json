    "description": "CoinDesk published its annual Most Influential list (it's not a ranking, except for the top 10 being maybe more influential than the other 40).  I wrote a few pieces (I had nothing to do with the art and didn't know about it when I wrote the pieces), as did my CoinDesk reg team colleagues, but I wanted to take a minute to recognize other influential figures who we may see pop up again. This is not meant to be a comprehensive or objective list; just a recognition of some of the folks whose work I've paid attention to this year."

    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is gaining pace above the $0.40 resistance. ADA could rally if there is a clear move above the $0.432 and $0.450 resistance levels. ADA price is moving higher above the $0.400 pivot level. The price is trading above $0.415 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.410 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could accelerate higher toward the $0.500 level or even $0.550. Cardano Price Starts Steady Increase After forming a base above the $0.3750 level, Cardano started a steady increase. There was a break above the $0.388 and $0.400 resistance levels, but ADA lagged momentum like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even climbed above the $0.420 resistance. A high was formed near $0.4293 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.3% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3715 swing low to the $0.4293 high. ADA is now trading above $0.415 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.410 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.4250 zone. The first resistance is near $0.432. The next key resistance might be $0.450. If there is a close above the $0.450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.50 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.550. Are Dips Supported in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.432 resistance level, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.4150 level. The next major support is near the $0.410 level and the trend line. A downside break below the $0.410 level could open the doors for a test of $0.388. The next major support is near the $0.372 level. Technical Indicators 4 hours MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. 4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level.
