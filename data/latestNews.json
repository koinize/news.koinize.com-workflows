However, the conflict between its usefulness and its ability to infringe on intellectual property (IP) has seen a particular struggle in the creative industries. </p><p>Major players in the music industry from artists and record labels to institutions like the Grammys and YouTube have all had to factor in AI in some form. </p><p>In the midst of traditional spaces in the music industry dealing with technology, new platforms are popping up that are embracing the technology from the start. Musixy.ai launched on Sept. 14 to serve as a streaming platform, label and marketplace for music exclusively generated by AI. </p><p>Cointelegraph spoke with Can Ansay, the CEO and founder of Musixy.ai, to better understand how giving AI-generated music its own space could shape the future music industry. </p><p>Musixy.ai said that it aims to become the “Spotify for AI hit songs,” particularly those that have been banned from other platforms. Over the last year, Spotify and other major streaming platforms have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/spotify-reportedly-deletes-thousands-of-ai-generated-songs\">become more vigilant</a> after <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/universal-music-group-tells-streaming-services-to-block-ai-generated-music\">Universal Music Group sent out an email</a> asking them to step up their policing of copyrighted AI tracks. </p><p>Ansay said “the establishment” or major labels are in panic mode again, “as it was back then with Napster, because they fear revenue losses due to a new disruptive technology.”</p><blockquote>“Unlike back then, the AI revolution is not only perfectly legal, but even threatens the existence of record companies; music is not only produced much more efficiently but also cheaper.”</blockquote><p>He said AI presents “talented producers” with the ability to produce and monetize a hit song with any famous voice in any language. Musixy.ai particularly emphasizes the creation of new and covered hit songs with AI-generated vocals of well-known artists. </p><p><strong><em><u>Related: </u></em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-bieber-hit-track-becomes-nft\"><strong><em>AI-generated music challenges “efficiency” and “cost” of traditional labels, music exec.</em></strong></a></p><p>Musixy.ai also works with Ghostwriter, who produced a viral song with AI-generated vocal tracks of artists Drake and the Weeknd called “Heart on My Sleeves.\" </p><p>The song initially was said to be <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-drake-song-grammy-nomination\">eligible for a Grammy</a>, though the sentiment was later clarified by the Grammy CEO highlighting that it was taken down from commercial streaming platforms and didn’t receive permission from the artist or label to use the vocal likeness and<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grammy-ceo-ai-drake-song-ineligible-for-award\"> therefore doesn’t qualify for nomination</a>. </p><p>Ansay said if Musixy.ai is recognized as a streaming platform by the Recording Academy:</p><blockquote>“For the first time these amazing AI-assisted songs could rightfully win the Grammy recognition they deserve, produced with the help of AI.”</blockquote><p>“This is especially true for those songs that unofficially use the vocals of famous singers with the help of AI that were arbitrarily banned from all other recognized streaming platforms,” he continued.  </p><p>Ansay argues that from a legal perspective, vocal likeness is not “protectable,” as it would violate professional ethics and make it difficult for singers to work having a voice similar to another more famous voice. </p><p>Instead he suggests that AI vocal tracks should be marked as  \"unofficial\" to avoid confusion.</p><p>Recently Google and Universal Music Group were reportedly in negotiations over a tool that would allow fo<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/universal-music-google-negotiate-ai-deep-fakes\">r AI tracks to be created using artists’ likenesses</a> in a legal way.</p><p>When asked if AI-generated music be \"competing\" on the same level as non-AI-generated music in terms of awards and recognition or have its own playing field - he said both directions could be viable. </p><blockquote>“For that to happen, one must legitimately, legally, and arguably under the rules of the Grammys, distinguish what tasks AI is used for in music production and to what degree.”</blockquote><p>Otherwise, he believes a new category should be created such as  \"AI Song of the Year\" or something similar. \"Because according to the Grammys' mission statement on their website,\" he argued, \"they also want to recognize excellence in 'science.'\"</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/tokenizing-music-royalties-nfts-taylor-swift-3lau-nas-the-weeknd/\"><strong><em>Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/how-much-pulled-crypto/",
    "description": "The crypto industry is known for its sheer price movement volatility, driven mainly by events and liquidity crunches. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a noticeable and consistent outflow of cash from the cryptocurrency market, which is unsurprising.  According to Bitfinex’s latest report, this capital drain was evident in August, as the crypto market saw an exit of about $55 billion in capital from major cryptocurrencies. $55 Billion Drained In The Past Month Bitfinex&#8217;s analysis, which measured the aggregate realized value metric of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and major stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, USD Coin (USDC), BUSD, Dai, and TrueUSD (TUSD), indicates that about $55 billion in capital exited the market in August. Related Reading: The Real Reason Behind That Bitcoin Transaction With A $500,000 Fee Has Been Revealed Although the market struggled for most of the first half of the year, things became different in July as Bitcoin spearheaded inflows. During this period, Bitcoin crossed $30,000 for a while as over $100 billion has entered the market. However, the momentum changed in early August, as profit-taking and continued mixed signals from the US economy triggered outflows.  “A deep dive into the data reveals a prevailing trend: by early August, the industry had begun to experience capital outflows,&#8221; said the report. Interest from institutional investors during this period, especially, started to wane as digital asset investment funds registered outflows after four weeks of heavy inflows. The trend has continued to the time of writing, as the run of outflows now totals $294 million.  What Caused The Crypto Capital Drain? The report from Bitfinex shows that August&#8217;s capital drain was the biggest this year, especially for Bitcoin. Most of this drain came from two isolated events, resulting in immense price movement in a relatively short period. In particular, the August 17 flash crash saw Bitcoin&#8217;s price drop by 11.4% in a few hours.  “August was the largest red monthly candle for BTC since the bear market bottom was formed in November 2022 at –11.29 percent as per Bitfinex Data.” The crypto derivative market has also had a similar trajectory. Ether (ETH) futures and options markets have slowed considerably in 2023. The average daily trading volume is down almost 50% from the two-year average to $14.3 billion daily.  Related Reading: Why This Crypto Exchange Founder Believes Bitcoin Can Still Rise 150% From Here Bitcoin has also seen some liquidity crunches, as data shows almost 69% of all mined Bitcoin have not moved in over a year. On the other hand, this suggests a high conviction from investors and a buoyant outlook on the future of the digital currency.  September has been relatively quiet regarding price movement, and the industry awaits the beginning of the next bull market. However, this crypto exchange founder believes that a bull run already started in March but the market is yet to catch on.
