    "description": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2,200 zone. ETH could start a decent increase if it settles above the $2,240 resistance. Ethereum started an upside correction from the $2,165 zone. The price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair might start a decent increase if it clears the $2,240 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery Ethereum price managed to form a support base above the $2,165 level. ETH seems to be consolidating losses near the $2,200 level and might aim for a recovery wave, like Bitcoin. There was a minor upside correction above the $2,200 level, but the bears are still active near the $2,240 resistance zone. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,240 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low. The next major resistance is near the $2,280 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price might rise and test the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low. If the bulls push the price above the $2,320 resistance, they could aim for $2,360. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $2,360 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,420 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,500 zone. Another Failure in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level. The next key support could be the $2,165 zone.
