The price of XRP remained over the $0.60 threshold during the early hours of Tuesday.

This phenomenon has contributed to the development of a positive outlook for XRP. The price of XRP is currently $0.6105, 1.8% less than it was a day ago. Despite the continued downturn, interest in the asset is increasing; transaction volume has increased by 25% in the past day to around $1.2 billion. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.39 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Implications Of The Ascending Triangle For XRP&#8217;s Future One of his most recent updates on XRP, where he drew attention to the asset&#8217;s moves on the weekly chart, demonstrates his ongoing bullishness. XRP is presently trading inside an ascending triangle that has been there since 2018, according to EGRAG&#8217;s chart. An ascending triangle is a bullish pattern in technical analysis, formed by a horizontal resistance line and a rising support trendline. It indicates a market where buyers are consistently pushing the price higher against a specific resistance level.
