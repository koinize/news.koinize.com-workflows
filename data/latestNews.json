According to the #Bitcoin liquidation heatmap, there&#8217;s a potential strategy unfolding where liquidity hunters could drive the price of $BTC down to $45,810. This move is aimed at triggering liquidations amounting to $54.73 million! pic.twitter.com/monFlZmvQ6 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 9, 2024 Martinez stated that liquidity hunters in the BTC market could be looking to push the token’s price as low as $45,810 for personal benefits. For context, liquidity hunters are traders or investors who actively seek opportunities in the financial markets to exploit changes in liquidity.  This set of market players often targets specific price levels where there is a concentration of stop-loss orders or where market liquidity is expected to be thin. By triggering liquidations or capitalizing on price movements, liquidity hunters aim to profit from short-term market inefficiencies.  According to Martinez, the liquidity hunters in the BTC market are currently looking to induce an estimated 3% decline in the token’s price. While this change may seem minimal, it represents an astounding $54.73 million in liquidations. Based on these numbers, BTC traders and investors should be wary of potentially significant losses in the coming days.  Related Reading: Analyst: After Bitcoin Hits $50,000, Expect Another 100% to 200% Rally BTC Price Overview  The premier cryptocurrency has recently taken flight, gaining by 8.6% in the last two days after a flat period of consolidation stretching to the beginning of February. Interestingly, the asset’s pathway to higher gains appears more confident with recent developments in the Bitcoin spot ETF market, which recorded a total net flow of $403 million on February 8 &#8211; the highest value of that metric since January 17.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $47,238, with a 0.26% gain in the last hour.
