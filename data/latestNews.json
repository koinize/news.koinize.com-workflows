    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-foundation-selling-eth/",
    "description": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization, has initiated an unexpected ETH sell-off to a single address, prompting speculation about a potential market peak.  Ethereum Foundation Executes Multiple ETH Transfers On Monday, March 4, Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain revealed a series of transactions executed by a wallet address related to the Ethereum Foundation. Sharing a screenshot of the transaction details on X (formerly Twitter), LookOnchain disclosed that the Ethereum Foundation had initiated three ETH transactions to a single wallet address identified as “Cumberland Forwarder”.  Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says ‘Prepare Yourself’ For Massive Altcoin Run, Here’s Why Among these transfers, two involved selling off 500 ETH each, while the third recorded a transaction amount of 0 ETH. At the time of writing the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,684.95 according to CoinMarketCap. This price puts the value of the Ethereum Foundation’s 1000 ETH sell-offs at over $3.68 million.  It’s uncertain whether this unexpected sell-off indicates a shift in the foundation’s perspective on Ethereum’s current valuation, as the foundation is known for selling ETH tokens during tops. Additionally, the timing of the transfers could be an indication of a peak in Ethereum’s price, which often precedes a significant price correction.  Including the Ethereum Foundation, there have been other major ETH transfers made by investors. Earlier in January, bankrupt cryptocurrency company Celsius Network initiated a massive sell-off worth about $125 million ETH. Following this large-scale transfer, Ethereum’s price experienced a major decline.  With the price of Ethereum slowly approaching its peak value, if a similar sell-off phase occurs, it could potentially trigger a shift in market sentiment, pushing investors to opt for other major cryptocurrencies as they attempt to diversify their portfolios and avoid risks.  ETH&#8217;s Price Update Recently, Ethereum has been witnessing significant gains, driving its price closer to its previous all-time high of $4,379 in May 2021. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been aggressively following Bitcoin’s recent bullish uptrend, reinforcing its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Reach A New All-Time High This Week, Matrixport Head Of Research Says Various analysts have consistently made bullish predictions about the price of Ethereum, with the majority expecting the cryptocurrency to surge above $5,000 soon. Considering the multiple upgrades and developmental activities ongoing within the Ethereum blockchain, a price surge to $4,000 seems probable.  In the advent that Ethereum reaches its “top in”, the cryptocurrency may undergo a sell-off phase, as investors seek to maximize profits by cashing out their investments. This could lead to a price reversal, with persistent selling pressures diminishing demand and instigating Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) among traders and investors.  ETH price beats $3,700 resistance &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com"
