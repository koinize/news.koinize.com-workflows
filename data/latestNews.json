He said:</p><blockquote>“We are working on recovering the assets for our clients and we will be filing a class action against Atomic Wallet [...] They didn’t give our clients any information about the hack or go to the police to report it.”</blockquote><p>Atomic Wallet, the noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet, suffered a massive $100 million exploit in mid-June 2023. The breach <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-hackers-swipe-over-100m-from-atomic-wallet-users\">affected at least 5,500 crypto accounts</a> on the platform. Crypto analytics firms like Elliptic subsequently linked the heist to the North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus Group, which is believed to be responsible for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korea-stole-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-from-exchanges-says-un\">stealing billions in crypto</a> through various thefts.</p><p>While initial reports blamed Lazarus for the attack on Atomic Wallet, the new claims suggested that there may be another culprit.</p><p>According to Feldman’s allegations, it is much more likely that a Ukrainian group had orchestrated the hack. His firm Destra has been working on the case with blockchain analytics at Match Systems, who work on their own investigation on behalf of the investors.</p><p>“They have found traces of involvement of Ukrainian hacker groups,” Feldman reportedly said.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/newly-discovered-bitcoin-wallet-loophole-let-hackers-steal-funds-slow-mist\"><strong><em>Newly discovered Bitcoin wallet loophole let hackers steal $900K — SlowMist</em></strong></a></p><p>As previously reported, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/atomic-wallet-hack-statement-exploit-unanswered-questions\">Atomic Wallet didn’t clarify what conditions</a> exactly led to the exploit in June. The firm only laid out the four most “probable” causes, including a virus on user devices, an infrastructure breach, a man-in-the-middle attack or malware code injection. Atomic Wallet also continued to reiterate that less than 0.1% of app users were affected.</p><p>Soon after going through the hack, the cryptocurrency wallet apparently continued operating as usual.</p><p>Atomic Wallet did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/big-questions-did-the-nsa-create-bitcoin/\"><strong><em>Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

The six wallets contain 1,580 Bitcoin worth $40 million believed to be hoarded from the various cryptocurrency hacks over the past year.</p><p>The FBI in its investigation found that the Lazarus group moved approximately 1,580 BTC linked with several crypto exploits. These funds are currently sitting in the following Bitcoin addresses:</p><ul><li>3LU8wRu4ZnXP4UM8Yo6kkTiGHM9BubgyiG</li><li>39idqitN9tYNmq3wYanwg3MitFB5TZCjWu</li><li>3AAUBbKJorvNhEUFhKnep9YTwmZECxE4Nk</li><li>3PjNaSeP8GzLjGeu51JR19Q2Lu8W2Te9oc</li><li>3NbdrezMzAVVfXv5MTQJn4hWqKhYCTCJoB</li><li>34VXKa5upLWVYMXmgid6bFM4BaQXHxSUoL</li></ul><p>The FBI warned crypto companies that the movement of funds linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group could be a sign that they are looking to sell. The federal investigation agency advised crypto companies to keep an eye out for the six BTC wallets and use blockchain data to keep track of any movement of funds.</p><blockquote>“Private sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses.”</blockquote><p>The North Korean hacking group has been actively involved in multiple crypto-linked exploits over the years, stealing billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. A recent report from TRM Labs suggests that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-hackers-steal-2b-of-crypto-since-2018-report\">North Korean hackers have stolen nearly $2 billion</a> in crypto since 2018. The group was most active in 2022, having <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korea-stole-more-crypto-in-2022-than-any-other-year-un-report\">stolen nearly $1 billion worth of crypto</a> assets last year alone.</p><p>2022 saw some of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits, and the Lazarus group was identified as the mastermind behind Harmony’s Horizon bridge and Sky Mavis’ $625 million hack on Ethereum-linked sidechain Ronin Bridge last year.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nobody-is-holding-them-back-north-korean-cyber-attack-threat-rises\"><strong><em>‘Nobody is holding them back’ — North Korean cyber-attack threat rises</em></strong></a></p><p>Although crypto-linked exploits due to code vulnerabilities in platforms and protocols have increased due to the sophistication in methods used by these hackers, blockchain technology still makes it problematic for exploiters to launder or move their ill-gotten gains, due to the public ledger that makes it possible to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-tracker-picks-up-trail-of-funds-heisted-from-harmony-bridge-in-june\">track the movement of funds</a>.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies like the FBI, along with crypto companies, have worked on several occasions in the past to freeze funds linked to such exploits.
