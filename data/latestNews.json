    "description": "\n                        <p>Two pioneering companies in the blockchain-based advertising landscape&mdash;VeraViews, under the Verasity ($VRA) umbrella, and Alkimi, a decentralized advertising exchange built on Ethereum &ndash; have announced their new joint venture today on August 22. The duo claims that their collaboration has the potential to redefine what's achievable in digital advertising, particularly in combating lack of transparency and inefficiency.</p>\n<p>As Verasity has long argued, the advertising industry has grappled with challenges around transparency. Advertisers are often in the dark about where their ads appear, raising concerns over brand safety and ROI. The new partnership looks set to address these long-standing issues by integrating VeraViews' 'Proof of View' (PoV) technology into Alkimi Exchange's ad platform.</p>\n<p>Within the collaboration, Alkimi's network of publishers can tap into VeraViews' ad stack, thus gaining access to a verified audience within VeraViews' network. Simultaneously, VeraViews will be able to scale up its monetization through Alkimi Exchange&rsquo;s robust network of advertising partners.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The decentralised advertising ecosystem is still nascent, and we&rsquo;re delighted that VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange have found ways to leverage our innovative technology solutions in synergy, working together to achieve our common goal of bringing trust and transparency to the programmatic advertising supply chain,&rdquo; says David Murray, Demand Director at VeraViews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ben Putley, the CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Alkimi Exchange, adds, \"Our collaboration symbolises not just a mutual understanding of our industry&rsquo;s future, but also a shared commitment to drive sustainable growth, forge new pathways, and redefine the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible. \"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nBroader Impact on the Advertising and Blockchain Landscape\n<p>Verasity has already been a strong advocate for using tech-based solutions to battle chronic challenges that plague digital advertising for several years. Its technology is already integrated into several significant video hosting and publishing platforms, including its notable partnerships with Brightcove Marketplace and Hoopla Digital.</p>\n<p>The integration between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange could serve as a significant step in eradicating some of these pervasive issues &ndash; which according to British newspaper The Guardian affects a whopping 25 percent of all digital advertisements.</p>\n<p>Should this alliance between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange demonstrate success in mitigating fraud and increasing transparency, it may pave the way for broader adoption within the burgeoning blockchain sector &ndash; and in turn revolutionize an industry that is estimated to rise to more than a trillion US dollars annually in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "description": "The current sentiment among Bitcoin investors may hold the key to understanding whether the current drop is a buying opportunity or not. &#8220;Buy The Dip&#8221; Optimism Is Fading In The Bitcoin Market In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into how the trader sentiment has shifted in the BTC sector since the crash a few days back. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Retest $20,500 Again? This Pattern May Suggest So First, the analytics firm has checked for the amount of &#8220;buy the dip&#8221; types of calls that have been happening on social media recently. Looks like the value of the metric had been quite high not too long ago &#124; Source: Santiment Here, Santiment has made use of its &#8220;social volume&#8221; metric, which finds the unique number of social media posts that are making mentions of a given term or topic. Naturally, the social volume for Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is taken here, and has then been filtered for terms like &#8216;buy&#8217; and &#8216;dip.&#8217; From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the social media users were participating in some heavy discussion around such topics just when the Bitcoin crash toward the $26,000 level occurred a few days ago. This implies that the traders were optimistic that the asset would quickly recover and they believed that the drop presented an ideal buying opportunity. As the asset has only continued to move sideways since the crash, however, optimism on social media has appeared to have slowly vanished, as &#8216;buy the dip&#8217; calls have plunged. However, this is not all bad news as Santiment points out. &#8220;Believe it or not, it&#8217;s a good sign that people are no longer certain that this is a dip buy spot,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;It means that pessimism is beginning to take over again as market caps fade.&#8221; Historically, bottoms have become more probable to form the more pessimistic about the market the majority of the traders have been. Thus, this development can potentially allow the coin to recover. In terms of the social volume broken across the major social media platforms, it would appear that Redditors have still not given up hope for a reversal. Buy the dip calls on Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan &#124; Source: Santiment While the overall market sentiment may have cooled down, it would seem that it hasn&#8217;t yet happened on all platforms equally. But it may provide a unique opportunity for a good entry point. &#8220;When all four social platforms align and have settled back down to neutral mentions of buying the dip, this is when the actual opportunity has historically presented itself for patient traders,&#8221; notes Santiment. Related Reading: XRP Whales Accumulate, Can Price Recover Now? A sign that may not be so positive can be the fact that the &#8220;social dominance&#8221; of Bitcoin, the percentage share of the total social volume of the top 100 assets, has dropped back to normal levels, after briefly hitting the highest level of 2023 following the crash. The metric's value has cooled down a bit &#124; Source: Santiment This would mean that social media users are still engaging in discussions related to altcoins, which is a sign that there is still greed left in the market. Ideally, the Bitcoin&#8217;s social dominance should remain high. &#8220;High discussion related to the #1 asset coincides with fear, whereas discussions about more speculative assets tends to coincide with greed,&#8221; says the analytics firm. &#8220;Fear is when markets rise.&#8221; Overall, it would appear that the market sentiment is moving in the correct direction, but it hasn&#8217;t yet completely aligned in a way that has historically been favorable for a Bitcoin rebound to occur. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 11% in the last week. BTC has observed a plunge recently &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
