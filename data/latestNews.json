    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/the-price-peak-puzzle-unraveling-the-timing-of-bitcoin-bull-market-peak/",
    "description": "As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its remarkable ascent, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $72,300, investors wonder when the current bull market will peak. Considering historical data and the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has provided insights into potential timing.  Bitcoin Peak Expected Sooner Than Expected? By examining previous halving cycles and the “acceleration” observed in the current cycle, Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s bull market may peak within 266-315 days from breaking its old all-time high, potentially occurring in December 2024 or February 2025. Rekt Capital&#8217;s analysis reveals that Bitcoin has historically peaked in its bull market approximately 518-546 days after a halving event. However, the current cycle demonstrates accelerated growth, reducing approximately 260 days.  According to the analyst, this acceleration has the potential to halve the typical cycle length, indicating that Bitcoin&#8217;s peak in the current bull market may occur much sooner than anticipated. Related Reading: 94 Million XRP Exits Binance As Bulls Reclaim Control, What’s Going On? Rekt Capital&#8217;s perspective, measuring the bull market peak from when an old all-time high is breached, provides valuable insights. In this cycle, Bitcoin recently broke to new all-time highs, indicating a potential milestone in the market.  If the accelerated perspective holds, the next bull market peak is estimated to occur within 266-315 days from this breakout, landing somewhere between December 2024 and February 2025, according to the analysis provided by Rekt.  Roughly every four years, Bitcoin&#8217;s halving events have historically played a crucial role in shaping market cycles. These events reduce the block reward miners receive, thereby reducing the rate of new Bitcoin supply, but this time may be different, according to Rekt, another analyst.   From Four-Year Cycle To New Horizons Similar to Rekt&#8217;s analysis, market expert Crypto Con suggests that the &#8220;conventional four-year cycle&#8221; may no longer hold, as Bitcoin is reaching new all-time highs sooner than expected, and as such, Crypto Con believes that the &#8220;boundaries of the traditional cycle&#8221; are being pushed, potentially signaling a paradigm shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics.  Historically, Bitcoin&#8217;s price cycles have adhered to a four-year pattern, characterized by market peaks around four years after each halving event. However, Crypto Con challenges this notion, arguing that the current cycle deviates from the “traditional timeline.”  Related Reading: Cloudy Future For Ethereum ETFs – What’s Casting Doubt On Their Fate? Bitcoin&#8217;s recent entry into “price discovery mode” and the achievement of new ATHs approximately a year earlier than expected suggest that the four-year cycle may no longer hold its predictive power. Crypto Con&#8217;s analysis indicates that the current market trajectory aligns more closely with the 2017 bull run than with previous cycles. Comparing the first tops of cycles 1 and 3 (2013 and 2021) to the present, both instances were on the verge of forming their initial peaks around April, mirroring the current market conditions.  This observation supports the possibility of Bitcoin&#8217;s next bull market peak occurring in late 2024 rather than the previously anticipated late 2025.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-whale-makes-8-13m-in-profit-as-bullish-rally-continues/",
    "description": "Pepe coin (PEPE) has been showing an incredible performance alongside the rest of the crypto market. This weekend, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, displayed remarkable price growth. BTC keeps reaching new all-time highs (ATH), and ETH surpassed the $4,000 mark for the first time in two years. Similarly, PEPE joined the party after hitting a new ATH over the weekend, which prompted whales to take profit on their bags. Related Reading: Pepe Coin Soars Over 250% – Will March Bring More Surprises? Whale Makes Big Profits After Price Surge After its launch in April of last year, the frog-themed coin shook the crypto space and the memecoin market, becoming one of the most recognizable memecoins in the sphere. Despite the big start, PEPE&#8217;s price started fading as the market turned its eyes to competitors like BONK and other Solana-based memecoins. However, the bull run has propelled the market prices to heights unseen since 2022, and PEPE has taken advantage of the bullish momentum. As reported by the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale made over 431% in profits in just two weeks. The address shows that the trader withdrew over 1 trillion PEPE tokens from Binance in three transactions before the price skyrocketed. In just 2 weeks, this trader made $8.13M(+431%) on $PEPE! This trader deposited 196.18B $PEPE($1.7M) to #Binance for profits 4 hours ago, with 1T $PEPE($8.31M) left. He withdrew 1.19T $PEPE(cost ~$1.88M) from #Binance before the price of $PEPE increased.… pic.twitter.com/FWZgIWcCYP &#8212; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 10, 2024 The first transaction of 713.12 billion PEPE was made 15 days ago when it was trading at around $0.00000138. The second withdrawal, about 316.36 billion tokens, was done a day later when the token price was $0.00000180. Finally, the trader withdrew 116.7 billion tokens one more time when the price was hovering around $0.00000269. Lookonchain said these withdrawals accounted for 1.19 trillion PEPE tokens, which cost about $1.88 million. Yesterday, the whale deposited 196.18 billion tokens back to Binance for profits of $1.7 million. The address still has 1 trillion PEPE left, worth around $8.13M at the time of the report. At the time of writing, these holdings had increased by over $1 million and were worth $9.13 million. As reported by NewsBTC, whales have profited from their PEPE holdings since the memecoin started its resurgence in late February. PEPE’s Massive 800% Surge Despite the volatile crypto market and whales selling large amounts of PEPE, its community seemingly feels confident in the frog-theme coin and considers it THE memecoin of this bull run. $PEPE will surprise everyone like $DOGE did in 2021. After the first Dogecoin pump in 2021, some people regretted not buying. Don&#39;t make the same mistake in 2024 with $PEPE. This is THE meme coin of this bullrun. pic.twitter.com/lUq213XwFQ &#8212; Tryrex (@Tryrexcrypto) March 9, 2024 Since the memecoin interest surged, Pepe coin has tagged along and shown massive growth. In the last 14 days, the token has registered a staggering 549% price. Even more impressively, the price has risen 799.5% in the past month. The token has climbed to the top of the memecoin ranking after flipping tokens like BONK and CorgiAI. PEPE now sits as the third largest memecoin with a market capitalization of $3.85 billion, an 8.41% increase in the last 24 hours. Similarly, its daily trading volume has increased by 16.85% to $1.49 billion, suggesting that market activity and interest in the memecoin have surged in the last day. At writing time, PEPE is trading at $0,000009135. This represents an 8.5% rise in 24 hours and a 5.95% decrease from its ATH of $0,000009793, registered two days ago.

    "description": "Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, has provided a bullish analysis of the current price action of Cardano (ADA). The crypto analyst also dispelled the notion that ADA won’t perform well in this bull cycle, noting that the crypto token is where it is meant to be before it takes off.  Where Cardano Is Headed Gambardello mentioned in a video posted on his X (formerly Twitter) platform that CardanoADA could rise to $1.15 and as high as $1.50 in its next move to the upside. He made this statement while highlighting a reversal zone on the weekly chart, which was critical the last time ADA made a breakout.  Related Reading: Crypto Whales Bet Big On LINK – Is Chainlink The Next Bitcoin? The crypto analyst claimed that the token is again at the lower end of this reversal zone, which happened before ADA broke out the last time. Meanwhile, looking at the order book, he revealed that there is historically a lot of interest and market participants at the $1.20 price level. As such, it is another area that could act as a “magnet for ADA at the upper end of the reversal zone.” The crypto analyst also tried to allay the fears of those worried about ADA’s current price action. He stated that the token lagging while Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs (ATHs) is “historically normal” and suggested that a move was imminent for ADA based on data from past cycles. Gambardello further asserted that “things are on pace,” so there is no need to be worried.  An Explanation For ADA’s Current Price Action Gambardello also elaborated on why ADA has yet to experience any parabolic move. He alluded to the 2021 bull run when Bitcoin kept hitting new highs between December 2020 and January 2021, while Cardano lept lagging during this same period and didn’t make any move until later in January 2021.  Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE, Others Are About To Explode He added that ADA was 80% from its ATH back then before it made its move and even kept declining while Bitcoin was on a surge. However, that changed all of a sudden as “ADA went crazy to the upside.” The crypto analyst went on to reaffirm his belief that ADA “does lag, but when it finally moves, it really moves very strongly.” Gambardello had previously predicted that ADA could rise to as high as $11 in this bull cycle. Back then, he noted that the crypto token now has more robust fundamentals compared to the last bull run.  At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.73, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  ADA price at $0.739 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Swyftx Learn, chart from Tradingview.com"
