Today, she’s at the forefront of digital fashion.</p>\n                    <p><p><strong>Leila Ismailova began her professional career at the age of 15 as a broadcasting star in Belarus, the Russian-neighboring Eastern European country that plays home to 9.3 million citizens. She continued in the role for 10 years, she says, before reaching what she felt was a professional ceiling and beginning a journey that led to Web3.</strong></p><p>I remember my audacity as a child, just sneaking into the buildings with newspapers and magazines  it was called the House of Press, Ismailova recalls in an interview with Cointelegraph. I would handwrite my stories and sneak into the building  because I didnt have a pass  by making up stories that I was someones granddaughter, or by just going in when someone else entered. And I would find the doors that said editor or editor-in-chief, and I would just walk in and give them my articles. People smiled, and Im sure they felt I was naive, but I felt they also had some respect for me doing this work.</p><p>Her renegade news career led to television in a matter of years. She joined the countrys First National Channel at the age of 15, where she started on a show that covered news and culture for younger viewers.</p><p>My first audition went horribly, Ismailova says. I turned purple. I was thinking really fast, but they still wanted me to come for the second round.</p><p><strong><em>Also read:</em> <em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-net-zero-2050-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >How brands are using digital fashion in real life</a></em></strong></p><p>Ismailova moved to the United States in 2016, setting off what she calls a season of migration for her family, including her brother, Bahram, and sister, Esmira. Bahram is a serial tech entrepreneur whose inventions include Peech App and Yope, among many others, while Esmira is an author whose published works include <em>On the Shores of Bosphorus. </em>(You wont find it in English yet, so dont spend too much time scouring Amazon.)</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Leila-Ismailova-1024x567.jpg\" alt=\"Leila Ismailova with co-host Denis Kuryan in 2014.\" class=\"wp-image-23422\" width=\"550\" height=\"309\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leila Ismailova hosting the International Music Festival Slavic Bazaar in Vitebsk, Belarus, 2014.

Their father died when they were children (Bahram was just 1), fighting for Azerbaijan in the countrys war with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.</p><p>It happened very abruptly, Ismailova says. Of course, no one planned for it, so we went very fast from being a well-off family living in the capital of Baku to being a very scared family. We were pretty much on our own in a country that was going through the war with Armenia and, on top of that, separating from the Soviet Union. It was a very harsh time for everybody.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><p>Ismailova says that experience inspired her to launch a charity during her broadcast career that offered mentoring for orphans, an activity she would like to resume in the future.</p><p>It seemed like these girls, even though the government provided very simple basics for them to start life, didnt have parental guidance, Ismailova recalls. It seemed like a lot of orphan girls were insecure because no one told them they were beautiful. Our goal was to create that guidance and to give them a confidence boost. […] For me, it was very important to do, and I was so lucky that I had a chance and a bit of influence.

As a child, I didnt have access to a lot of beautiful dresses, Ismailova says. But I always appreciated the elegant and beautiful part of fashion, and when I watched TV, I always saw TV hosts and red carpets. It always looked stunning.</p><p>Ismailova left Artisant in July to launch a new chapter of her career as a consultant for digital-savvy fashion brands. Im sort of coming back to reality, Ismailova explains. Artisant was a digital fashion brand, but there was no physical product.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-you-moved-from-belarus-where-you-were-a-tv-journalist-to-the-united-states-what-s-the-story-behind-that\"><strong>1.

I opened the season of migration for my family, as right after I moved, my sister moved, and then my brother. He didnt just move  he ran away in August 2020, right after the Belarusian presidential election, when they started hunting people down. He had to run.

I wanted to be a TV host because I wanted to wear beautiful dresses. I was very happy. It was my dream job! I started working early, and I think I was very hungry for success. I got all the national awards I dreamed of at a very young age, hosted all the shows I wanted to, and reached the professional ceiling back home.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-what-got-you-into-crypto\"><strong>2. What got you into crypto?</strong></h2><p>Well, my first stop in the United States was California  this was before I moved to Miami. I got into graduate school for a masters program at USC Annenberg. (To be honest, Im still struggling to connect to American society.) Ive always been a nerd, and school seemed like a safe environment to connect to people. I started learning about entrepreneurship during the first wave of crypto in 2017, and then I invested in my first crypto and lost it. I bought Litecoin at $250. But I started working in crypto only in 2020. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-what-brought-you-to-miami\"><strong>3. What brought you to Miami?</strong></h2><p>I felt very limited in Los Angeles with the COVID-19 restrictions, and very isolated. I couldnt even walk my dog because they closed the parks. So, I got into digital fashion. It got me very curious about how something that didnt exist could make someone feel so good. That was when I met my Artisant co-founder, Regina [Turbina], in 2020. We were talking, and I started helping with little things. In 2021, I joined Artisant full-time.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/blockchain-games-decentralized-lattice-starknet-cartridge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Blockchain games arent really decentralized but thats about to change</a></em></strong></p><p>Things were flowing, so I quit my job and took a leap of faith  which brought me to Miami. And since I joined crypto, never have I met so many bright, prominent people with open minds. Everyone has been very welcoming, even though I knew far less in the beginning than I know now. People were willing to spend hours on the phone with me, sharing knowledge. I think the welcoming environment encouraged me to stay.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-how-do-you-see-digital-fashion-evolving-over-the-next-five-years\"><strong>4. How do you see digital fashion evolving over the next five years?</strong></h2><p>Looking at the last bull run, I think it was awesome, but its over. We have this romantic notion that were all moving to the metaverse, and our avatars will all need clothes someday. I want to see technology become a tool that makes people more well-rounded, sustainable  wholesome.</p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/an-eclectic-display-at-the-2nd-metaverse-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >An eclectic display at the 2nd Metaverse Fashion Week</a></strong></em></p><p>We have this vicious circle in the Western world of buying goods we dont need. Brands manipulate us into buying things. Consequently, we need to produce more goods, and we have this vicious circle of overproduction and overconsumption. We have a situation where fashion, the most beautiful business in the world, is responsible for 10% of carbon emissions.</p><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__desktop\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 1456x180 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=728x90;setID=601214;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><section class=\"adv-banner adbutler-ad adbutler-ad__mobile\"><div class=\"container\"><!-- 600x500 [img] --><a href=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=169476;size=300x250;setID=601213;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fmagazine%2Fwp-json%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fposts%3F_embed%26per_page%3D100;type=img\" ></a></div></section><p>We have a huge problem at hand, and I see digital fashion and technology as a possible solution. Were moving from the notion of building digital clothes for the metaverse to looking at how digital fashion can be useful right now. Look at Dior and their B33 sneaker collection with NFC chips built into the sole. Its an amazing technology that allows you to link them to digital assets. So, this is a very good way for brands to solve the problem of counterfeit products.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-you-recently-left-artisant-where-are-you-going-next\"><strong>5. You recently left Artisant. Where are you going next?</strong></h2><p>Im starting consulting jobs, and I want to start writing more. For now, I want to focus on companies that deal in digital fashion. Companies that provide digital fashion services as an agency. I have a brand that wants me to consult their team, and they do an amazing clothing line that has augmented reality storytelling built into it. Im sort of coming back to reality. Artisant was a digital fashion brand  but there was no physical product.</p><p>Seeing Artisant grow  not just in numbers but in real people who defined Artisant as their community  meant the whole world to me. But I came to a point where I gave everything I could to the project. Technology has a huge mission in reforming the world of fashion, and I want to contribute. While I am still pondering my next big professional adventure, I know it will be fun and will serve humanity.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-what-s-your-life-like-outside-of-crypto\"><strong>6. Whats your life like outside of crypto?</strong></h2><p>I love having a balanced life. I have a dog. (Thats a hobby, right?) I play chess. For me, chess is a very important game that helps me a lot in business and in analyzing situations. I also like sports. For me, its very important to keep moving.

As one of the most widely adopted stablecoins, its launch on the platform in Chile represents further utility for both cryptocurrency and the United States dollar in Chile.</p><p>Travel and consumer awareness sites often mention that the U.S. dollar isn’t accepted for payment as often in Chile as it is in many other Latin American countries. </p><p>According to Matias Spagui, senior director of Mercado Pago:</p><blockquote>“The US dollar is one of the most stable currencies in the world and a simple vehicle to ensure wealth preservation amidst general uncertainty. With the launch of this stablecoin we seek to diversify access to cryptocurrencies and offer the more than two million Mercado Pago users an alternative that matches the value of the dollar.”</blockquote><p>Mercado Libre announced its intent to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mercadolibre-plans-to-accept-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-as-payment-for-all-products\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/mercadolibre-plans-to-accept-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-as-payment-for-all-products/amp\">accept cryptocurrencies as payments</a> back in 2021. In the time since, it’s made strides toward doing so, with the integration of USDC for users in Chile being just the latest example.

As Cointelegraph reported, the deal gives Circle additional responsibilities as USDC launches on multiple blockchain platforms going forward. </p><p>Prior to the realignment, Circle announced that it was preparing for the eventual intrusion of traditional finance and Big Tech giants into the cryptocurrency and stablecoin spaces by gathering resources. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-preps-1b-war-chest-to-deal-with-market-threats-from-paypal-and-others\" data-amp=\"https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/circle-preps-1b-war-chest-to-deal-with-market-threats-from-paypal-and-others/amp\"><strong><em>Circle preps $1B war chest to deal with market threats from PayPal and others</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-breaks-above-26000-a-stronger-bounce-is-imminent-says-this-metric/",
    "description": "The Bitcoin price trades close to the $26,000 level during today’s trading session, as it has since last week. However, new data points to a potential breakout out of the current range and into previously unexplored territory in 2023. Related Reading: Bloomberg Expert Analyst Explains Why A Fall To $10,000 Isn’t Bad For Bitcoin As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $25,950 with sideways movement across the board. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization display similar price action as the sector enters another period of low volatility. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Making A Decision? The co-founder of crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Yann Allemann, recently shared data that could hint at a potential rebound. Via social media X, Allemann pointed at Bitcoin’s Relative Index Strength (RSI), a metric used to measure when an asset has entered overbought or oversold territory. BTC’s recent downside price action pushed the RSI to a historical oversold level, 28. The chart below shows that almost every August with a negative RSI and a BTC monthly return north of 10% leads to a sideways September but to a green October. If the price of Bitcoin moves in tandem with its history, this decline in performance and RSI could hint at massive gains for the cryptocurrency in the coming two months. The Glassnode co-founder stated the following: Past trends suggest that such movements often indicate the potential for upward price shifts. This implies that as sellers grapple with further drops, the stage might be set for a reversal in the near future. Also, the chart shows that Bitcoin rarely sees two Octobers in the red following a bear market as the one experienced in 2022. This fact adds to the bullish thesis for Bitcoin as 2023 enters its final months, and new narratives increase their influence over the price action. On the other hand, Allemann pointed at the increasing Open Interest (OI) for Bitcoin as prices trend sideways. The analyst believes that most OI comes from traders opening long positions. Related Reading: Crypto Currents: Can Whale Investors Bring PEPE Back In Action? As the OI rises, BTC will likely see another aggressive move. Short liquidation could push the cryptocurrency back into its previous range if the price trends to the upside. However, if the opposite occurs, the high amount of long positions could push BTC into crucial support."

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/long-term-bitcoin-holders-supply-remains-untouched/",
    "description": "A recent report from Bitfinex has shed light on a trend in the Bitcoin market. The report shows despite the unpredictability of the crypto market; long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be playing the patience game, signaling a buoyant outlook on the digital currency. This resilience and sense of optimism come to the fore as Bitfinex&#8217;s Alpha report reveals roughly 40% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total supply has remained untouched for over three years, marking an all-time high. Related Reading: JPMorgan Shares Prediction On Bitcoin’s Next Move: What You Need To Know Bitcoin Dormant Supply Hits Record Highs The latest Bitfinex report illuminates that about 40% of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply has not witnessed any movement for more than three years. Based on the Coin Days Destroyed metric, the findings further highlight that this portion of the BTC has remained inactive on-chain. Analysts at Bitfinex, in a note, deduced that this pattern highlights a prevailing mood of confidence, hinting at possible stability in the face of usual market fluctuations. The analysts noted: This behavior insinuates a broader sentiment of optimism and potential resilience against market volatilities. It is worth noting that such a trend can be interpreted as a clear indication that long-term Bitcoin enthusiasts are maintaining a bullish perspective. Contrasting Metrics: Narrower Timeframes Hint At Bearish Sentiments While the three-year metric paints a promising picture of enduring confidence, the picture is slightly different when the lens narrows to a one-year timeframe. Within this shorter period, the inactive supply metric points towards a bearish sentiment, hinting at potential price drops. Bitfinex&#8217;s report stated: &#8220;Our analysis indicated that movements on this timeframe preceded the price drop.&#8221; A case in point is the sudden major Bitcoin fall on August 17, which led to the loss of roughly over $1 billion in liquidations. This crash plunged BTC&#8217;s value momentarily to the $25,000 zone. The analysis by Bitfinex suggests that this crash can be attributed, in part, to the &#8220;newer&#8221; long-term holders. According to the report, these individuals, who secured their positions during the bear market, are now experiencing a sense of &#8220;unease without succumbing to panic.&#8221; Related Reading: BREAKING: Grayscale Triumph: SEC Crushed, GBTC Rockets Towards ETF, Bitcoin Targets $28,000 Meanwhile, following the conclusion of the legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto asset manager Greyscale, in which the latter emerged victorious, Bitcoin experienced a notable surge. BTC is trading above $27,000 when writing and marking a 5.2% increase in the past 24 hours. This news is especially significant considering BTC was hovering just below $26,000 and moving sideways before the announcement. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"
