If you know what you are doing, AI can be leveraged to improve your efficiency.“</blockquote><p>When asked whether a tool that increases the efficiency of human auditors would mean firms like OpenZeppelin would not need as many, Wegener told Cointelegraph that the total demand for audits exceeds the capacity to provide high-quality audits, and they expect the number of people employed as auditors in Web3 to continue growing.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator\"><strong><em>Satoshi Nak-AI-moto: Bitcoin's creator has become an AI chatbot</em></strong></a></p><p>In a May 31 Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwkby/status/1663702657448411136https://twitter.com/mwkby/status/1663702657448411136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">thread</a>, Wakabayashi said that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are not yet ready for smart contract security auditing, as it is a task that requires a considerable degree of precision, and LLMs are optimized to generate text and have human-like conversations.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Because LLMs try to predict the most probable outcome every time, the output isn&#39;t consistent.<br><br>This is obviously a big problem for tasks requiring a high degree of certainty and accuracy in results.</p>&mdash; Mariko (@mwkby) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwkby/status/1663702664041967617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>However, Wakabayashi suggested that an AI model trained using tailored data and output goals could provide more reliable solutions than <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-chatgpt-king-how-top-free-ai-chatbots-fared-during-field-testing\">chatbots currently available to the public</a> trained on large amounts of data. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What does this mean for AI in web3 security?  <br><br>If we train an AI model with more targeted vulnerability data and specific output goals, we can build more accurate and reliable solutions than powerful LLMs trained on vast amounts of data.</p>&mdash; Mariko (@mwkby) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwkby/status/1663702666306789376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><strong><em>AI Eye: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ai-eye-traders-chatgpt-stock-picks-ai-dice-adobe-firefly/\">25K traders bet on ChatGPT’s stock picks, AI sucks at dice throws, and more</a></em></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
