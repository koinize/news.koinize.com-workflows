    "description": "<p>Despite the earth shattering development of a new BRICS currency to rival the dollar, Western mainstream news media is generally silent on the matter.</p>\nA rival reserve currency\n<p>The hegemony of the US dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency has remained intact since the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944. However, the average citizen in the West is probably not aware that a group of countries termed the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) is about to announce a new rival reserve currency, with the likelihood that it will be backed by gold.</p>\n<p>The announcement is expected to take place at the BRICS summit, in late August, only a matter of weeks away, and none of the mainstream media outlets in the West have reported on what has the potential to be the biggest monetary change since Bretton Woods.</p>\nBacklash against the dollar\n<p>The weaponisation of the dollar in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was seen by many countries as a move that could potentially be used against them in the future, and so a move away from the dollar has begun.</p>\n<p>This rebellion against US hegemony has undoubtedly been led by Putin, but has the backing of the other BRICS nations and countries that are in the process of joining them, including Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf Cooperation Council among others.</p>\nGold backing\n<p>Originally, the BRICS currency was to be backed by a basket of commodities, which included gold, but according to Alistair Mcleod, Head of Research at GoldMoney.com, this would probably not work, and therefore gold on its own is likely to be that backing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the flow of gold from West to East over recent decades can certainly be accounted for, along with the increase of gold mining production in China and Russia.</p>\n<p>With as many as 41 countries either joining or expressing interest in joining the BRICS trading bloc, the combined populations and GDP would be equal to more than half of the world and would be far bigger than that of the Western alliance.</p>\nThe West needs to wake up\n<p>This introduction of a new rival reserve currency is not likely to usurp the dollar&rsquo;s position any time soon. However, the attraction of a currency that is actually backed by a real asset, instead of the dollar, which is printed out of thin air and has no backing at all, might be anticipated to grow steadily over time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such a development should greatly alarm the West. Media blackouts on the situation should not be the alternative to free and open dialogues on such a critical evolution in the global monetary system.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-encounters-familiar-resistance/",
    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a significant challenge in the form of the December 2022 low. This crucial level has proved a formidable barrier for SHIB bulls, thwarting their attempts to increase prices.  Despite recent upside movements, the resistance at this level has proven to be persistent, creating a precarious situation for the cryptocurrency.  As the price of SHIB hovers in this area, the question arises: Will the selling pressure overpower the bulls&#8217; determination and cause a reversal in the price action? Shiba Inu Faces Bearish Order Block And Potential Liquidity Hunt SHIB faces a significant challenge as its December 2022 low coincides with a bearish order block (OB) ranging from $0.00000785 to $0.00000824. This particular range, as highlighted in a recent SHIB price report, could serve as a stronghold for bearish sentiment in the market.

Consequently, the possibility of a liquidity hunt in this region cannot be disregarded, potentially leading sellers to extend their gains toward the immediate support level at $0.00000711. Source: Coingecko Amid recent market fluctuations, SHIB is currently trading at $0.00000788, based on data by crypto market tracker Coingecko. This reflects a decline of 3.4% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this short-term setback, SHIB has also notched a seven-day rally of 3.4%, showcasing its inherent resilience and potential for recovery in the long run. Decrease In SHIB Token Burns: Implications For Supply, Demand Meanwhile, Shibburn reported a notable decline in the number of tokens burned within the past 24 hours. A mere 1,233,806 SHIB tokens were burned in a single transaction, representing a sharp 91.59% decrease in the daily burn rate and in contrast, the previous week witnessed the burning of nearly 1 billion SHIB tokens. In the last 7 days, there have been a total of 915,371,832 $SHIB tokens burned and 139 transactions. #shib — Shibburn (@shibburn) July 16, 2023 This decline in token burns carries several implications for the SHIB ecosystem. Firstly, burning tokens plays a crucial role in reducing the overall supply of SHIB, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest However, with the significant decrease in the daily burn rate, the rate at which new tokens are being removed from circulation has slowed down considerably. This could impact the potential scarcity and perceived value of SHIB in the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap currently at $4.6 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Moreover, the reduced token burns may suggest a shift in market sentiment and investor behavior. It could indicate a decreased demand for burning tokens or a temporary lull in activity within the SHIB community. Market participants and SHIB token holders will closely monitor the implications of this decline in burns on future price movements and the overall supply-demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-sec-xrp-investors-need-to-know-deadline/",
    "description": "In the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the recent order granting in part and denying in part the motion for Summary Judgment by Judge Torres has left many XRP investors eagerly awaiting the next steps. To shed some light on the situation, prominent attorney Jeremy Hogan has shared his thoughts on the matter, offering valuable insights into the potential appeal process with deadlines and its implications for both parties involved. Ripple Vs. SEC: The Next Possible Deadline Hogan, a seasoned attorney with experience in appeals, cautions that appeals are typically pursued after a case is completely finished. “After the final judgment is entered, either party has 60 days to appeal,” says Hogan who emphasized that the Ripple case is not yet finalized, any potential appeal at this stage would be considered an &#8220;interlocutory appeal.&#8221; Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board “As far as I can see in the Rules, you have 10 days to notice an interlocutory appeal”, states Hogan. Since the Summary Judgment was issued on July 13, an appeal by the SEC or Ripple Labs would have to be filed by July 23 at the latest (or by July 24 if the deadline does not start until the following day). This means that next Monday at the latest it will become public whether one of the parties files an appeal. But an interlocutory appeal is rarely granted and generally requires compelling reasons, such as the release of significant information that could impact the case. However, Hogan points out that Judge Torres did not certify her ruling for immediate review, indicating that an interlocutory appeal might not be granted in this scenario. This suggests that the SEC and Ripple would need to wait for a final judgment before pursuing an appeal. Hogan believes that both parties might ultimately choose not to appeal for various reasons. According to the lawyer, the SEC might hesitate to appeal because, even if successful, it could potentially jeopardize their overall case. Winning the appeal would retract some unfavorable aspects of the trial-level case. However, if the SEC were to lose at the appellate level, it could set a precedent that all courts in the 2nd DCA (Second District Court of Appeals) would have to follow, amplifying the impact of their loss. Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC On the other hand, Hogan believes that Ripple may opt not to appeal if it can afford to pay the fine and if the ruling&#8217;s effect on its business, particularly the aspect concerning the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature, is manageable. These factors, combined with the fact that Ripple secured a favorable outcome in the ruling, might dissuade them from pursuing an appeal. When considering the potential difficulties in winning an appeal, Hogan emphasizes that Judge Torres is the one who has meticulously reviewed the entire case record. This makes the appellate process inherently challenging for either party, further reducing the likelihood of an appeal. Regarding the SEC&#8217;s challenge in appealing the secondary market sales aspect, which presents a problematic area for the regulatory body, Hogan admits that he hasn&#8217;t solidified his thoughts on the matter yet. XRP Price The XRP price has taken a breather after the stunning rally following the Ripple summary judgment. After being rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.93, the XRP price is currently trading at $0.7481. After a possible retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.68, the impulsive move may see a continuation. The final verdict in the Ripple v. SEC case and possible appeals will certainly continue to have a strong impact on the price. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com"
