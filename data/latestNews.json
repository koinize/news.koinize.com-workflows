    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/",
    "description": "Despite a continuous four-day streak of net outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) totaling $93.85 million, the Bitcoin price has impressively climbed to reclaim the $66,000 mark. According to data from Farside Investors, Grayscale ETF GBTC experienced a significant outflow yesterday, with a single-day net outflow of $358 million, culminating in a historical net outflow of $13.63 billion for GBTC alone. In stark contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF (IBIT) witnessed a considerable net inflow of $233 million yesterday, raising IBIT&#8217;s total net inflow to $13.32 billion. This is slightly below the average for BlackRock, which has seen $271.9 million in inflows since its launch on January 11. Other ETFs have not fared as well in recent days. Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC, the second-largest ETF, has thus far achieved an average daily inflow of $141.5 million, but experienced a disappointing $2.5 million in inflows yesterday. Related Reading: Beyond Bitcoin ETFs: ‘There Are Other Players Controlling This Market’ – Says Analyst The third-largest, Ark Invest&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF, has seen average inflows of $40.9 million to date, with yesterday&#8217;s inflows at just $2.0 million. Bitwise&#8217;s BITB, ranking fourth, has accumulated $30.7 million on average, with a modest $12 million in inflows yesterday. Across the board, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, including GBTC, have recorded an average of approximately $230 million in daily inflows since January 11. Bitcoin Price Stagnates: Reason To Worry? CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju provided insights on the situation via X, stating, &#8220;Bitcoin spot ETF netflows are slowing. Demand may rebound if the BTC price approaches critical support levels. New whales, mainly ETF buyers, have a $56K on-chain cost basis. Corrections typically entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51K.&#8221; Crypto analyst WhalePanda highlighted the trend, noting, &#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s ETF flows: Another negative day, that&#8217;s 4 in a row [&#8230;] Honestly surprised by how big the outflows are from GBTC. Another $358.8 million and that makes a total of $1.83 billion in just 4 days.&#8221; WhalePanda also touched on Genesis&#8217; role, suggesting the company&#8217;s “in-kind” sale of GBTC shares for BTC might explain the large outflows without corresponding market dumps. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surging But Likely To Consolidate Before Breaking $74,000: Analyst Thomas Fahrer, founder of Apollo, offered a bullish perspective, &#8220;I know it is forbidden to post anything bullish on #Bitcoin ETFs right now, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. GBTC selling is temporary. Financial advisors and institutions have barely begun buying. $100 BILLION inflows are coming next 1-2 years. Patience.&#8221; Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, commented on the Grayscale situation, &#8220;Grayscale Bitcoin ETF holdings falling off a cliff. Down 50%, or about $20B at current BTC price. We must be days/weeks away from them slashing fees to stop the bleeding. Blackrock holdings expected to overtake Grayscale before the Halving!&#8221; Although the last few days have been rather disappointing, it is worth noting that the outflows are coming (almost) exclusively from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, while other investors are holding on tight to their Bitcoin investments. This means that it is only a matter of time before Grayscale&#8217;s outflows stop, and even small inflows from the other ETFs make a big impact (without the outflows). At press time, BTC traded $66,203. Featured image created with DALL·E, chart from TradingView.com"
