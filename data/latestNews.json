Carlucci spoke about their goals with the new art gallery and why they are diving into NFTs and Web3 despite the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-totally-worthless-mainstream-media-says-community-responds\">conditions of current markets</a>. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/da2906ad-504c-4254-ac99-96c76223e220.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>First look at where NFTs will be displayed at the 37xDubai gallery.

He said: </p><blockquote>“We have various different types of digital arts, but we also have NFTs displayed. We don’t just sell these specifically handpicked NFTs, but we also educate the people who are visiting our gallery about what NFTs are.” </blockquote><p>Apart from displaying NFTs inside the gallery, the 37xDubai founder also highlighted that they are using NFTs that are inspired by their Tree of Life art installation as a membership token. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/57c7a40a-c2e1-42cf-8217-f598fc577bbc.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Founder Danilo Carlucci (left) with Cointelegraph's Ezra Reguerra at 37xDubai.

Carlucci said that while they’re not an NFT-only gallery, they do “believe in NFTs.” He highlighted that compared to the NFTs created by tech companies, the NFTs in the gallery have a different goal. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-10/a2b88958-19eb-43fd-b269-83a80a3c6ff4.jpg\"  alt=\"\"  title=\"\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Tree of Life art installment at the 37xDubai art gallery.
