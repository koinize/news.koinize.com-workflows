    "description": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened old wounds after a federal Judge grants the regulator‚Äôs request to file a new appeal against Ripple.¬†¬† Ripple And SEC Legal Battle Continues Ripple, the crypto firm behind XRP cryptocurrency, had secured a partial victory in July in its case against the SEC that had raged on for almost three years. However, the regulator has not taken this lying down as on Thursday, August 17, Judge Analisa Torres reportedly gave official approval to the SEC‚Äôs motion to file an interlocutory appeal against XRP cryptocurrency.¬† Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout According to the court proceedings, the SEC will file its motion in court from Friday, August 18 until Friday, September 1. This gives the regulator the opportunity and ample time to develop and provide a compelling argument for its allegations of XRP being a security.¬† This is because the appeal will be focused on the judge‚Äôs decision on Ripple‚Äôs programmatic sales and direct sales and offerings of XRP tokens as a trade for goods and services.¬† The new filing is not an official approval of an appeal by the judge but a gateway for the SEC to file its motion. But regardless, this new development could be bad for Ripple who recently celebrated Judge Torres‚Äô declaration that secondary sales of XRP did not count as a security.¬† Ripple‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chief Learning Officer, Stuart Alderoty have addressed the SEC‚Äôs decision to put forward an appeal motion. They publicly opposed the SEC‚Äôs interlocutory appeal, detailing that the Judge‚Äôs ruling on July 13 refutes any allegations the SEC may harbor of XRP being a security.¬† ‚ÄúWe oppose the SEC‚Äôs request for an interlocutory appeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,‚Äù Alderoty stated in a Twitter post.¬† On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented:¬† Reminder &#8211; the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn‚Äôt change the fact that XRP is not a security. That‚Äôs not up for debate/trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That‚Äôs utter nonsense. XRP price dumps alongside crypto market &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com SEC Regulator Criticizes Judge Ruling The SEC‚Äôs move to file an interlocutory motion does not come as a surprise as the regulatory body has previously made complaints about the proceedings of Judge Torres&#8217;s ruling in the XRP case. The regulator made criticisms of the case‚Äôs outcome by questioning the ruling‚Äôs alignment with legal principles and stating that the verdict was ‚Äúwrongly decided.‚Äù Related Reading: Post-Hack Shenanigans: Curve (CRV) To Launch On TRON Following $2 Million Investment The regulator has also been adamant about an interlocutory review and has stated that the case requires a higher review and better clarification by higher judicial authorities, to ensure legal proceedings are executed according to established laws and legal principles.¬† ‚ÄúInterlocutory review is warranted here. These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,‚Äù the SEC said in its new filing.
