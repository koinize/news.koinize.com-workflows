Deaton has offered insights into the Ripple Labs XRP lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He contends that a settlement valued at $20 million or less would constitute a significant legal triumph for the company.</p><p>In a recent X social media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1720847636998041908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">post</a>, Deaton strongly refuted the idea that the lawsuit’s result was an even 50-50 outcome for the SEC, asserting that it leaned closer to a 90-10 advantage in favor of Ripple. Deaton’s remarks were prompted by a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1720491980910714923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">post</a> from Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, highlighting another legal setback for the SEC.</p><p>Deaton’s viewpoint resonates with the sentiment in the cryptocurrency community, which generally views the suggested $20 million settlement as a positive resolution for Ripple. This assessment considers the potential consequences of the XRP lawsuit and the broader regulatory environment for digital currencies.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The people who’ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Ripple</a> case are  wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple’s favor.

According to Alderoty, in the case of SEC v. Govil, the 2nd Circuit ruled that the SEC cannot request a substantial disgorgement award without first demonstrating actual financial harm to “investors.“ In essence, it implies that if there’s no harm, there’s no penalty.</p><p>In December 2020, the SEC initiated legal action against Ripple Labs, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/the-sec-vs-ripple-lawsuit-everything-you-need-to-know\">accusing the firm of conducting an unregistered securities offering</a> by selling <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>, its native cryptocurrency.</p><p>Ultimately, a precedent was established when Judge Analisa Torres determined that the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-wins-case-against-sec-as-judge-rules-xrp-is-not-a-security\">asset was not a security</a> when traded on a secondary market. Additionally, the case underwent significant changes as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-dismiss-lawsuit-brad-garlinghouse-chris-larsen\">the charges against Ripple executives were reduced</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-power-georgia-ccbdc-digital-lari\"><strong><em>Ripple to power Georgia’s central bank digital currency, the digital lari</em></strong></a></p><p>In the meantime, Judge Torres has recently <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-torres-grants-sec-s-request-to-leave-to-file-an-appeal-in-ripple-case\">granted approval for an order</a> regarding the SEC and Ripple’s joint request to propose a briefing schedule to address institutional sales of XRP. This relates to the segment of the XRP lawsuit in which the company was determined to have breached securities laws.
