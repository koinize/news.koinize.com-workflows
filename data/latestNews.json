    "description": "Software company Microstrategy bought another $37 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its unrealized profit to $37 million. Microstrategy Now Holds This Much In Unrealized Bitcoin Gain Michael Saylor, the founder and chairman of Microstrategy, has announced in an X post that the firm purchased an additional 850 BTC at $37.2 million in January,¬†which was recently approved. In a post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explains four important facts about Microstrategy&#8217;s portfolio after this latest shopping spree. Related Reading: XRP Buy Signal Goes Off, Analyst Says This Is How Long Uptrend Will Last First, here is a chart that shows how the total supply held by Microstrategy has grown over the last few years: The trend in the total amount of the cryptocurrency held by the company &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X The chart shows that the company has made several Bitcoin purchases over the past year and has substantially grown its holdings. Following the latest buying move, the firm&#8217;s wallets hold 190,000 BTC. This is a staggering amount, as the entire circulating supply of the asset is around 19.6 million BTC right now, which means Microstrategy alone holds almost 1% of the BTC supply. For perspective, all the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), combined, hold about 3.3% of the coins in circulation. Next, Maartunn has shared a chart displaying the cost of each purchase. The prices at which the firm made each of these buys &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X Adding up all these costs, the total price of Microstrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin stack is around $5.932 billion. However, the chart below shows that the company&#8217;s actual BTC value differs from this amount. Looks like the value of the firm's holdings has significantly gone up in recent months &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X As the graph shows, Microstrategy&#8217;s stack&#8217;s value at the current cryptocurrency price is notably higher than the amount it used to acquire these coins. In particular, the value of the company&#8217;s holdings is currently around $8.1 billion. Finally, the analyst shared a chart revealing the firm&#8217;s unrealized profit and loss trend over the years. The value of the indicator appears to be highly positive right now &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X Microstrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings had been in the red during the 2022 bear market and most of 2023, but with the start of the rally last October, the company&#8217;s fates finally changed as it returned to the green.

    "description": "On Tuesday, the Solana blockchain experienced a major outage that stopped the network‚Äôs mainnet operations for approximately 5 hours. The outage raised concerns about the blockchain‚Äôs stability and security as the incident became the 11th of the kind in the last 2 years. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin, This Billionaire Is Betting Big On Solana For 2024 Kicking Solana When It‚Äôs Down? On February 6, the Solana blockchain network suffered a significant outage that lasted 4 and 46 minutes and disrupted the network‚Äôs operations, raising doubts about the blockchain and exposing the project to fierce criticism. The crypto community took no time to share their thoughts about the situation, with many crypto investors referring to memes and jokes to express their concerns about the history of Solana‚Äôs outages. Among the online voices, Cardano‚Äôs Founder, Charles Hoskinson, took the opportunity to poke fun at the situation by referencing his previous jokes about the network. Hoskinson replied to the Solana team‚Äôs announcement simply stating, ‚ÄúThis always works,‚Äù and attaching a gif of a man blowing a malfunctioning video game‚Äôs cartridge before inserting it back into the console. This always works https://t.co/5kVRVGFM4l pic.twitter.com/X9yJXcETQn &#8212; Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 6, 2024 Members of the crypto community found the remark amusing. One user brought forward previous sarcastic comments that the Cardano founder made during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session two years ago. Hoskinson trolled the AMA viewers by claiming collaboration between the two networks was possible. He started saying, ‚ÄúYou know, collaboration with Solana would make a lot of sense‚Ä¶‚Äù before recalling a story of his brother owning a successful Nintendo repair shop and comparing the blockchain to a broken gaming console. ¬†So I was thinking since you know Solana comes from that world, that maybe there‚Äôs some legacy there, you know, we can figure out how to turn it on and off, taking it out on the cartridge, these types of things. I don‚Äôt know, it might be possible. Hoskinson finished the statement by mockingly suggesting that the collaboration wouldn‚Äôt happen, he said ‚ÄúBut my brother doesn‚Äôt do Nintendo stuff anymore. He‚Äôs a doctor.‚Äù &#34;Collaboration with Solana would actually make a lot of sense.&#34; @IOHK_Charles Perhaps #Solana can become a partner chain? #Cardano pic.twitter.com/8Vp0NMNl7a &#8212; St‚Ç≥kŒ£ with Pride üåà (@StakeWithPride) February 6, 2024 Besides Cardano‚Äôs founder, Wall Street veteran and journalist Max Keiser also criticized the Solana team‚Äôs announcement in reply. Keiser called SOL, Solana‚Äôs native token, ‚Äúcentralized garbage‚Äù and took the opportunity to also shoot at coins like ETH, ADA, and BNB. Solana Swiftly Recovers Recently, Solana‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem made the headlines after the Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) daily trading volume surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs for the second time, according to data from DefiLlama, hinting at healthy growth and development in the Solana ecosystem. Despite the doubts and concerns of crypto investors during the outage, SOL‚Äôs price recovered from the initial drop and has recovered 1.8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $97. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Solana Take Center Stage In $721 Million In Institutional Inflows SOL is trading at $97.2 in the 1-day chart.
