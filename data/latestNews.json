But dont be fooled: Smart people are making a lot of money out of dumb memecoins  invariably at the expense of not-so-smart people without good timing.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pepe_coin-1024x655.webp\" alt=\"Pepe\" class=\"wp-image-21457\" width=\"387\" height=\"248\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pepe_coin-1024x655.webp 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pepe_coin-300x192.webp 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pepe_coin-770x493.webp 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pepe_coin.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>PEPE is making memecoins great again.

So, without any fundamentals to trade on, can you still take a smart approach to making money by trading memecoins?</p><p>On Yavin, co-founder and head of business at Syndika, comes in with a hard no to that idea.</p><p>Anyone who says they have any trading strategies with memecoins is talking absolute BS, he says, adding the only reason memecoins have experienced a rush of interest this year is because of the bear market and crypto winter.</p><p>People need to do something with their investments, and they cannot wait until the next bull run. These people are not interested in investing in the real projects that take years to build. And theyre all about flipping and all about making a quick buck.

You are looking for something similar that hasnt left the station yet, says Verzun.</p><p>For 120,000 or so hopefuls this year, the train gathering speed away from the station was PEPE.

Showing the massive volatility for which memecoins are known, since the first draft of this story was written, the market cap has increased by $250 million to more than $600 million.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PEPE-Price-chart.png\" alt=\"PEPE Price chart\" class=\"wp-image-21424\" width=\"512\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PEPE-Price-chart.png 579w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PEPE-Price-chart-292x300.png 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>PEPE price chart.

She has traded in the likes of DOGE, PEPE, SFM and COOP. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There are pros and cons to everything, which Im excited to get into. Many memecoins at the beginning start as just speculation, then it can either grow to pump and dump or they start to build utility and a strong community around it  these [latter ones] are the types of ones I go for.</p></blockquote><p>Her three-point plan to make money while trading memecoins, in particular, is research, patience and efficiency.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sarah-Jane-Kennedy.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane Kennedy\" class=\"wp-image-21407\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sarah-Jane-Kennedy.jpg 720w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sarah-Jane-Kennedy-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Sarah Jane Kenny won the Communications Award at Blockchain Ireland recently.

After selecting a promising token, she then considers the most efficient way to trade, what fees might be included, transaction speeds and the different prices across different DEXs and CEXs.</p><p>She then advocates watching the market and learning the patterns for a time to see when the support comes in, and when the sells start happening. </p><p>Buy low, sell high  its easy on paper, but it takes a lot of time to get it right, so practice and keep notes, as the markets can be volatile. Remember to take profits, and only invest what you can afford to lose. You dont have to sell everything at once: dollar-cost average in, and out, to gain the maximum effectiveness with each trade, says Kenny.</p><p>She reckons the best memecoins are the ones that have a strong community, are building utility, and have some sort of meaning even if its a joke. Thats why she sees potential with COOP. </p><p>For the uninitiated, its an Algorand ecosystem coin based on a series of hilarious fictional videos by Cooper Daniels following an influencers quest to travel to Bitcoin Beach. Airdropped to the community, and with Daniels keeping zero tokens to himself, its sparked a ton of content and games related to COOP, which surged to become Algorands fourth largest token.</p><p>For the rubbish ones, you need to look out for the red flags, like the creator holding the majority amount of the token, if the team is not doxed, there is no progress being made with the token or community. Oh, and make sure the community is not just bots, too.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Coop-1024x587.jpg\" alt=\"Fed Coop\" class=\"wp-image-21458\" width=\"636\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Coop-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Coop-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Coop-770x441.jpg 770w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Coop.jpg 1381w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Even the Fed is keen on memecoins, according to this COOP meme.
