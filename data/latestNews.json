    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xlm-surges-with-10-rally-can-the-recovery-hold-its-ground/",
    "description": "Stellar (XLM) has experienced a robust resurgence, bouncing off a crucial support level at $0.11. Chart indicators are pointing towards a promising outlook for bullish investors, marking a significant shift in momentum since mid-August. This second rebound from the same support level underscores the formidable strength exhibited by bulls, hinting at the potential for further gains. A price analysis notes that the $0.11 support level has emerged as a steadfast defense line for XLM enthusiasts. Recent price action has illustrated that bears would need to work diligently to flip this level in their favor, extending the bearish momentum.  However, the bulls have displayed unwavering determination, as evidenced by the latest retest of the support on Sept. 4, which triggered a notable price pump. Related Reading: XRP Bottom Support Holds Strong: A Healthy Sign For The Crypto’s Price? As of the latest data, XLM is trading at $0.124 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 2% rally over the past 24 hours and an impressive 10% surge in the last seven days. These gains are indicative of growing optimism among XLM investors. XLM Chart Indicators Favor Bulls The on-chain indicators are aligning with the bullish sentiment surrounding XLM. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around the neutral 50 mark, suggesting a healthy demand for XLM. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at +0.10, indicating an influx of capital into XLM. This influx is typically a bullish sign, pointing towards the growing confidence among investors in the cryptocurrency. Despite the resurging optimism, XLM faces a battleground in the long/short ratio on exchanges. The tight margins indicate that sellers are actively trying to thwart the bullish rally. While long positions are inching closer to the critical 50% flip point of the long/short ratio, sellers currently maintain the upper hand, exerting pressure on XLM&#8217;s upward trajectory. XLM market cap currently at $3.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com What Lies Ahead For XLM? With the $0.11 support level proving to be a formidable stronghold for bulls and chart indicators hinting at further gains, XLM enthusiasts are eyeing a target range of $0.17 to $0.19, aiming to revisit the highs last seen in July. The crypto market remains dynamic and volatile, so investors should remain vigilant and stay tuned for developments that could impact XLM&#8217;s price trajectory. Related Reading: LINK Price Surge Ahead? Chainlink Sharks Bet Big On Accumulation XLM has staged an impressive rebound, bolstered by strong support and positive chart indicators. While challenges persist in the form of bearish resistance in the long/short ratio, the bullish momentum remains intact, with investors setting their sights on recapturing the July highs. The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and XLM&#8217;s resurgence is a testament to its resilience in the face of market fluctuations.
