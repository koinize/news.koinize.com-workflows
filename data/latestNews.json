    "description": "On-chain data shows that Bitcoin investors have been clearing out their wallets recently as the asset continues to be disappointing in this post-ETF era. Bitcoin Small Wallets Have Been Displaying Signs Of Capitulation According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the number of small BTC wallets has seen a sharp decline during the last few days. The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us about the amount of wallets that currently belong to the different holder groups on the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top: This Is When Bull Run Will Peak According To Past Pattern The addresses are divided into these groups based on the number of coins they are carrying in their balance right now. A wallet carrying 0.5 BTC, for instance, would belong inside the 0 to 1 BTC cohort. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for three different Bitcoin wallet groups over the last few months: The trend in the wallets of the small, mid, and large BTC holders &#124; Source: Santiment on X The first wallet group on the chart is the &#8220;0 to 1&#8221; coins cohort. The owners of such small wallets are usually the retail investors, popularly known as the &#8220;shrimps.&#8221; From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that these small hands have seen the total number of their wallets go down in the last few days. To be more specific, around 487,300 shrimps have cleared out their wallets in this selloff, a decline of almost 1%. &#8220;History tells us that this is typically a sign of capitulation, which can lead to a market price bounce until smaller traders begin to get optimistic toward crypto as an investment vehicle once again,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;The disappointment of market performances since the 11 ETF approvals over 2 weeks ago is largely attributed as the cause for these wallet liquidations,&#8221; Santiment adds. The spot ETFs have been one of the main topics in the cryptocurrency community during the last few months, and the price rally in Bitcoin was in part driven by anticipation around them. Unlike what some investors had imagined, though, the market sold at the news, and BTC has been unable to recover so far. The shrimps aren&#8217;t the only ones that have capitulated recently, though, as the 1-1,000 coins group has seen a decline of 4,752 wallets since January 5th, while the 1,000+ BTC entities have shed 27 addresses since December 27.

And interestingly, since the smallholders have started their latest capitulation, the whales have, in fact, seen some growth in their addresses. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen some sharp recovery push in the past day as the asset&#8217;s price has now bounced back to the $40,800 mark. Looks like the price of the coin has shot up over the last 24 hours &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

    "description": "On Thursday night, Algorand CEO Staci Warden’s X Account (formerly known as Twitter) was compromised. Since then, the crypto community and the hacker have been having a back-and-forth conversation. Related Reading: ALGO Blows Up To 42-Week High, Delighting Algorand Fans Justin Sun Will Boost Algorand To &#8220;New Heights&#8221; Algorand Foundation’s X account was the first to inform about the hack and advised users to be careful when interacting with the compromised account or any link promoted by it. The hacker then took Staci Warden’s compromised account to start a series of controversial posts and replies. The hacker called Algorand&#8217;s community &#8220;poor&#8221; in the initial post, later suggesting it would be better for the community if they &#8220;sold ALGO and instead bought Ether.&#8221; Both posts have amassed a combined total of 150,000 views and, as it&#8217;s worth noting, contain racial slurs. Additionally, the hacker offered a fake airdrop giveaway, claiming they would send “1 $ETH for every % $ALGO drops this week.” While following some users’ petitions, the hacker shared music and changed the account’s bio, claiming that Warden had exited Algorand Foundation and had become a “semi-professional pole dancer.” Staci Warden's X Account biography was changed by the hacker. Source: X Most notably, a fake story was shared in the account narrating a call with Tron founder Justin Sun, referred to as “his excellency” by the hacker. In the fake story, Sun promised to take Algorand to “new heights” under the condition that Algorand’s CEO gave total control over the network and allowed Sun to mint any token to back TRUE USD (TUSD). A sarcastic comment insinuating that Sun’s projects will be the reason behind “the next major financial collapse in crypto” closed the story. Algorand CEO Criticized By The Community The original announcement about the hack and the different posts shared on the compromised account ignited comments from the crypto community. Most users took the incident with humor, while others have taken the opportunity to express their discontent with the CEO. One user claimed that Algorand CEO “qualifies to be an intern” at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), clearly referencing the recent hack to the SEC’s X account suffered and resulted in a false report about the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Similarly, known crypto sleuth ZachXBT shared his thoughts about the hack, “Unpopular opinion: Staci hacker would make a better CEO for Algorand Foundation.” To which the hacker jokingly replied, “Hey bro, I just send you $10,000. Keep up the good work for this industry, buy your mom some flowers, and take your father out for a nice dinner,” referencing a previous X post informing the crypto detective of a donation made about a week ago. No further posts have been shared in the last hours, but the account appears to still be under the hacker&#8217;s control, as none of the posts have been taken down, and there’s no official statement about the account’s recovery. As reported by NewsBTC, ALGO outperformed the general crypto market growth in Q4 2023, experiencing an increase in market capitalization, transaction volume, revenue, and user adoption. ALGO’s prince trades at $0.1652, a 3.18% surge in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Exploit On Polygon Contracts Extract $15M, Here Are The Details ALGO is trading at $0.1652 in the hourly chart.
