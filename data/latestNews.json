    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-poised-for-december-surge-as-historical-patterns-suggest-strong-upside-ahead/",
    "description": "As the eagerly awaited Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) verdict approaches, excitement and anticipation continue to grow in the cryptocurrency market.  According to a report by K33 Research, the upcoming decision, expected between January 8 and January 10, has been a significant factor behind Bitcoin&#8217;s positive momentum since October. Institutional demand remains robust, with traditional investors strongly interested in adding long BTC exposure.  Bitcoin Set For Bullish December?  Bitcoin has displayed a notable tendency to surge higher in the lead-up to major events, creating a sense of enthusiasm and driving prices upward. This phenomenon has been observed across various significant milestones in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s history.  According to the report, examples include Bitcoin&#8217;s peak coinciding with the launch of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange&#8217;s (CME) BTC futures in 2017, its spike coinciding with Coinbase&#8217;s public listing in April 2021, and its peak on the day El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. Similarly, Bitcoin reached its peak on the date of VanEck&#8217;s spot ETF deadline in November 2021. These instances highlight the potential for Bitcoin to experience significant price movements as the ETF verdict draws near. Related Reading: Solana-Powered Helium (HNT) Spikes By 145%, Analyzing The Drivers Of The Surge The report emphasizes the substantial demand from institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. BTC exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed inflows of nearly 40,000 BTC in November, while CME open interest reached and maintained all-time highs. Futures premiums have also surged to 20%, indicating the strong interest from institutional players.  In contrast, retail participation has shown signs of stagnation. Offshore flows have remained shallow, and Bitcoin-denominated open interest in BTC perpetual contracts is currently at yearly lows. These factors suggest that institutional flows continue to be the driving force behind Bitcoin&#8217;s solid market strength. Based on the historical pattern of event-driven price movements and the sustained institutional demand, the report maintains a positive outlook for Bitcoin in December.  As the ETF verdict approaches, K33 Research’s report suggests that the narrowing time window is expected to fuel enthusiasm and drive prices higher. However, it is worth noting that once the event occurs, prices may experience a temporary surge before potentially stabilizing, according to the report.   BTC’s Bull Run Indicator Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a significant development in the Bitcoin market that suggests a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency.  According to Martinez, the Realized Price of Bitcoin has surpassed the Long-Term Holder Realized Price, signaling an increase in market momentum and attracting new investors willing to purchase Bitcoin at higher prices.  Martinez&#8217;s analysis highlights that similar occurrences in the past have preceded substantial price surges, further fueling optimism regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s future performance.  The Realized Price of Bitcoin refers to the average price at which all previously transacted coins were acquired. It considers the price at which each Bitcoin unit was last moved on the blockchain.  On the other hand, the Long-Term Holder Realized Price focuses specifically on coins held by long-term investors, providing insights into their average acquisition price. When the Realized Price surpasses the Long-Term Holder&#8217;s Realized Price, it suggests that newer investors are entering the market and are willing to buy Bitcoin at higher valuations. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin As seen in the above chart, Bitcoin experienced significant gains following this bullish signal on three separate occasions in the past. Specifically, the cryptocurrency surged 12,736%, 4,474%, and 819%, respectively, following similar events.  In addition to Martinez&#8217;s bullish outlook for BTC, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has demonstrated relatively stable price action above $44,000 in the past hour.  This stability increases the potential for continued upside and consolidation above key levels, positioning Bitcoin for further gains and surges in the future. It remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency will see any corrections following its impressive 16% surge over the past few days.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/web3/what-is-web3-technology/",
    "description": "The path from the Bitcoin whitepaper to the bustling ecosystem of Web3 technology has been nothing short of revolutionary. In this guide, we trace the evolution of digital currencies as they pave the way for the Web3 frontier—a new internet paradigm underpinned by blockchain technology and decentralized ideals. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Web3 technology. We&#8217;ll delve into the web3 meaning, web3 projects, web3 domains, explore its foundational concepts, and examine how to invest in web3. As we unpack the essence of Web3, we&#8217;ll reveal why it&#8217;s not just a technological leap, but also a cultural and economic revolution, poised to reshape the internet as we know it. Introduction To Web3 Technology In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital world, Web3 technology emerges as a groundbreaking paradigm shift, redefining how we interact with the internet. Rooted in the principles of decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, it represents a significant leap from the traditional, centralized web—often referred to as Web2. At the core of Web3 lies blockchain technology, the same innovative force that brought cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into the limelight. However, it extends far beyond just digital currencies. It encompasses a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and a new generation of internet services and platforms that operate autonomously and are not controlled by any single entity. Web3 Meaning: A Comprehensive Guide The web3 meaning captures the essence of a decentralized online ecosystem underpinned by blockchain technology. It is an umbrella term that encapsulates an internet where users have sovereign control over their data, identities, and transactions. This vision for the next web generation stands on the pillars of decentralization, openness, and greater user utility. Unlike its predecessors, Web3 facilitates a user-centric internet, harnessing the principles of cryptocurrency economics, collective governance, and immutable records. Within &#8216;what is web3 technology&#8217;, we find the blueprint for a participative and interoperable web, where the networks are maintained by the users themselves rather than by tech conglomerates. Furthermore, the web3 definition extends to include not just the structural and functional changes but also the philosophical shift towards a self-governing, resilient, and equitable digital space. Web3 Definition Web3 is defined as the third generation of the internet, characterized by decentralized networks that utilize blockchain technology and token-based economics. It&#8217;s a shift from consuming content to owning and contributing to the network&#8217;s assets and operations. This succinct web3 definition encompasses a future where the internet operates autonomously, enabled by distributed ledger technology, and is free from the control of centralized authorities. The Evolution from Web1 To Web2 To Web3.0 The digital world has undergone a significant transformation from Web1 to Web2, and now to Web3.0, each phase marking a pivotal shift in how the internet is structured and utilized. This evolution can be seen as a journey from static web pages to interactive experiences, and finally to a decentralized, user-driven web. Web1 Meaning Web1, often referred to as the &#8216;Static Web,&#8217; was the internet&#8217;s first iteration. It was characterized by static websites that were purely informational and offered limited interaction. During this era, content was created by a small group of producers and consumed by the users, who had no direct way to contribute or alter the information. The key aspect of Web1 was its simplicity and ease of access to information, laying the foundation for the more interactive web that followed. Web2 Meaning Web2, also known as the &#8216;Social Web,&#8217; revolutionized the internet by introducing interactivity, social networking, and user-generated content. This era saw the rise of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, where users not only consumed content but also contributed to it, creating a more dynamic and collaborative web experience. The shift to Web2 brought about significant changes in how people connect, share, and communicate online, paving the way for a more connected global community. Web3 Meaning Web3.0, or simply Web3, represents the next phase in the evolution of the internet. This iteration is defined by its decentralized nature, leveraging blockchain technology and token-based economics. It&#8217;s a paradigm shift from the centralized platforms of Web2, giving users unprecedented control over their data and online interactions. Web3:// is a concept that exemplifies this change, indicating a move towards a more secure, private, and user-empowered web. Web3 introduces concepts like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), signaling a significant leap towards a more open, transparent, and equitable internet. Web3 Explained: Beyond The Basics Delving deeper into the realm of Web3, it&#8217;s crucial to move beyond the basics and understand the intricate mechanisms that define this new digital epoch. It&#8217;s about a transformative shift in how we perceive and interact with the web—a shift toward a more decentralized, transparent, and user-centric online world. How Web3.0 Is Changing The Internet Landscape Web3.0, often simply referred to as Web3, is dramatically altering the internet landscape. This transformation stems from its decentralized nature, distributing power and control across the network instead of centralizing it in the hands of a few dominant players. This shift in control signifies not just a technological change but a fundamental shift in digital power dynamics. It ushers in an era of increased privacy, enhanced security, and greater user sovereignty, making the internet a more equitable and participatory space. It&#8217;s an exciting time, as Web3 opens up new possibilities for creative and economic freedom online. Moreover, it also has the potential to fundamentally disrupt the Web2 business models of platforms like Facebook. Disrupting Traditional Business Models Web3&#8217;s approach to data ownership and user empowerment directly threatens the established Web2 models. In the Web2 ecosystem, typified by platforms like Facebook, user data is a commodity. These platforms collect and monetize user information through targeted advertising, creating revenue streams heavily reliant on user data. Web3, however, introduces a paradigm where users have full control over their data. Through blockchain technology, Web3 enables individuals to own and monetize their data, participate in governance, and directly benefit from their contributions to the network. This shift in data ownership and control represents a seismic shift in how online business models function. For instance, in a Web3-based social media platform, users could earn tokens for their content, engagement, and community contributions. These tokens could represent actual stake in the platform, giving users not just a say in how the platform evolves, but also a share in the economic benefits. This model starkly contrasts with Web2 platforms, where user activity generates value that primarily benefits the platform owners. It&#8217;s model of shared ownership and profits poses a significant threat to the traditional ad-revenue-driven models of Web2 companies. Impact On Established Tech Giants Let&#8217;s consider a hypothetical scenario where a major platform like Facebook faces a Web3 competitor. In this scenario, the Web3 platform empowers users with control over their data, allowing them to opt into advertising schemes voluntarily and transparently. Users could even earn a share of the advertising revenue generated by their data. This transparency and profit-sharing model could attract users away from traditional platforms, compelling companies like Facebook to rethink their data and revenue strategies. Moreover, the application of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) introduces a governance model that is more democratic and user-influenced. Users of a DAO-driven platform can propose, vote on, and implement changes to the platform, directly influencing its direction and policies. This level of user involvement and control is unprecedented in the Web2 landscape and could lead to a more user-centric and ethical online platform. Web3 Is Going Great: Explained The phrase &#8220;Web3 Is Going Great&#8221; refers to a website by Molly White, a crypto researcher &#38; critic, software engineer, Wikipedian which is called &#8220;Web3 is Going Just Great&#8221;. White&#8217;s website serves as a critical ledger, chronicling the various scams and fraudulent activities within the crypto and Web3 space. As of November 2023, the site&#8217;s &#8216;Grift Counter&#8217; has tallied a staggering $69.52 billion in financial losses due to these nefarious activities. Some of the latest examples of frauds covered on the “Web3 Is Going Great” site include: Monero Community Crowdfunding Wallet Drained: Monero, focused on privacy, encountered a significant setback when its community crowdfunding system (CCS) was compromised and entirely drained, losing about 2675.73 XMR (approximately $460,000), funded by donations. Safemoon Executives Charged For Fraud: The executives behind Safemoon, a crypto token which had its all time high market cap in April 2021 with $17 billion, were charged with defrauding investors. They promised a secure investment but engaged in practices like removing tokens from the liquidity pool, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Infringement Lawsuit In The NFT Space: A notable case in the NFT realm involved Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen, who were ordered to pay $1.6 million in a lawsuit over creating identical NFTs to the Bored Ape collection. Key Web3 Projects And Innovations Web3 is fostering a multitude of innovative projects across various domains. These platforms stand out, revolutionizing traditional financial systems with decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading. Similarly, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) offer a new model for organizational governance using blockchain technology. Gaming and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are also significant sectors. Play-to-earn gaming models have emerged, where players can earn cryptocurrency or NFTs through gameplay. These games often incorporate blockchain to ensure true ownership of in-game assets. Moreover, Web3 is also seeing growth in decentralized social media platforms, where users have control over their data and can earn from their online interactions. These platforms challenge the centralized model of current social media giants by offering more privacy and reducing dependency on advertising revenue models. Another niche is domain services. Spotlight On Prominent Projects In the vast and varied landscape, certain projects stand out for their innovative contributions and foundational roles in shaping the future of decentralized technology.
