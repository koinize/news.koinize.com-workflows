According to research analyst Brian McColl,</p><blockquote>“The US Debt ceiling saga and the earlier events with banks going bankrupt surely affected Ether’s popularity and more and more users prefer to stake their money in ETH rather than keep them in the bank.”</blockquote><p>The debt ceiling or debt limit in the U.S. is a statutory cap on the total amount of national debt that the U.S. Treasury may incur, limiting the amount of money that the federal government may borrow to pay off its existing debt.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hodlers-exited-capitulation-above-20k-new-metric-hints\">Bitcoin hodlers exited ‘capitulation’ above $20K, new metric hints</a></em></strong></p><p>As Cointelegraph reported earlier, President Joe Biden and House majority leader Representative Kevin McCarthy reportedly reached an <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-rep-mc-carthy-tenative-u-s-debt-ceiling-deal-report\">agreement to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling</a>.

    "description": "<p>Stablecoin Tether has fought through the challenging stablecoin market and propelled its market cap to reach an all-time high of $83.2 billion.&nbsp;</p>\nUSDT Hits ATH\n<p>According to data from multiple sources, stablecoin issuer Tether&rsquo;s USDT has emerged from the gloom and doom of a declining stablecoin market to hit a record-breaking market cap of $83.2 billion. The stablecoin hit its all-time high on Thursday, taking it just over its peak from a year ago, and now commands 7.5% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This signifies a growing demand for USDT, especially in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite regulatory concerns and increased competition, Tether has continued to dominate the stablecoin landscape, cementing its position as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization.</p>\nIncreased Scrutiny On Stablecoin Market&nbsp;\n<p>The stablecoin market especially suffered monumentally after the dramatic implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022. It was exacerbated by the increased scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world that wanted to prevent a repeat of the catastrophic event.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Circle-issued USDC, which is the second largest stablecoin, was also hit badly by the downfall of its banking partner Silicon Valley Bank in March. Even the one-time $20 billion market cap Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin also saw its struggles when issuer Paxos was forced by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to stop minting new tokens.</p>\nUSDT Comes Through With Peg Stability\n<p>Although USDT, too, struggled in the challenging market environment, losing around $18 billion of its market cap, it was able to regain the lost market capitalization and hit a new record high at $83.2 billion. While stablecoins have faced scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world, Tether has managed to thrive amidst the challenging environment. Its ability to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar has attracted investors seeking a reliable digital asset that mitigates volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>In fact, as a report from digital asset researcher Kaiko notes,</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Tether&rsquo;s rise suggests peg stability is far more important for most stablecoin holders than issuer transparency.&rdquo;</p>\n\nSuccess And Controversy\n<p>The surge in Tether's market cap can be attributed to several factors. First, the increasing adoption of digital assets by mainstream financial institutions has bolstered demand for stablecoins as a means of facilitating transactions and providing liquidity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Tether's market cap growth is indicative of its expanding user base. DeFi platforms also rely on stablecoins like Tether to facilitate lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities, further contributing to its rising market cap.</p>\n<p>Despite its success, Tether has not been without controversy. The stablecoin has faced allegations of lacking transparency and adequate backing for its reserves. However, Tether has consistently maintained that its reserves are fully backed by assets, predominantly cash, and short-term debt instruments.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
