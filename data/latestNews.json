    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arkhams-new-crypto-intel-trading-platform-a-game-changer-for-traders/",
    "description": "Arkham, a blockchain intelligence platform, announced the launch of the world&#8217;s first on-chain intelligence marketplace, the Arkham Intel Exchange.  This new platform will connect buyers and sellers of information on any crypto wallet address securely and anonymously via smart contract technology.  Arkham&#8217;s Anonymous On-Chain Intel Exchange  The Arkham Intel Exchange is designed to meet the growing demand for on-chain analysis from traders, investors, journalists, researchers, and protocols. The platform also aims to provide a way for talented on-chain sleuths to monetize their skills and experience, creating a decentralized intel-to-earn economy. According to the announcement, buyers on the Arkham Intel Exchange can request and purchase information related to any on-chain activity, not just limited to entity labels. For example, victims of an exploit may pool resources to acquire Intel on the exploiter, while a trading firm may wish to buy out intel on their wallet before a competitor finds it.  Any information related to a crypto wallet address, such as transaction history, balances, and other on-chain activities, can be bought and sold on the Intel Exchange.  Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? The platform aims to provide a liquid market for information, allowing on-chain sleuths to monetize their work at scale and meet the growing demand for on-chain intel in a scalable way. But how does the bounty system work? The bounty system on the Arkham Intel Exchange is designed to connect buyers who need information on a crypto wallet address with bounty hunters who have the required intel. Buyers can post bounties by setting a reward for the information they need, and the reward can be in any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. Once a bounty is posted, bounty hunters can claim it by submitting the requested intel. The bounty hunter who submits the required intel first is eligible to claim the reward set by the buyer. To prevent spam, all bounty hunters must stake a small amount, which will be slashed in the event their submissions are not approved. Additionally, any intel bought or sold on the Intel Exchange will be exclusively held by the acquirer for 90 days. After that, the information will be propagated to all users, ensuring the decentralization of on-chain knowledge to the community over the long run. After the 90-day holding period is over, the information is added to the Arkham platform and granted to Arkham&#8217;s wider community. This ensures the decentralization of on-chain knowledge to the community over the long run.  The Arkham Intel Exchange will be live on Tuesday, July 18, and all transactions on the platform will take place through smart contracts audited by Arkham&#8217;s partner, Quantstamp.  Arkham Token Sale Goes Live On Binance Launchpad Binance Launchpad, the token launch platform of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has announced its partnership with Arkham for the public token sale of its native token ARKM. This marks the 32nd project to feature a token sale on Binance Launchpad. The ARKM token sale will follow the Launchpad subscription format, which will record user Binance Coin (BNB) balances for six days starting from July 11th, 2023. The final BNB holding amount for each user will be determined as the average of the six days, using the Daily Average BNB Balance calculation previously announced by Binance. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Hits Key Resistance, What’s Next? The ARKM token sale is set to have a hard cap of $2.5 million, with a hard cap per user of $15,000 (or 300,000 ARKM). The total token supply for ARKM is set at 1 billion, with 5% (or 50 million ARKM) allocated for the Binance Launchpad. The public sale token price for ARKM is $0.05 per token, with the price in BNB to be determined before subscription. The subscription timeline is set to take place from July 17th to July 18th, with the subscription period opening for all eligible users for a 24-hour period.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com "
