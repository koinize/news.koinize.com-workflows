Essentially, tokenization allows anyone to convert an off-chain asset into a digital, on-chain token. </p><p>One of the most popular early use cases for tokenization is in the real estate sector. Investment property purchases are typically the domain of large investors or investment corporations. When real estate is considered valuable, it’s usually difficult for small investors to approach the market. </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-new-age-in-investing-the-transformative-power-of-asset-tokenization\">A new age in investing: The transformative power of asset tokenization</a></em></strong></p><p>Tokenization not only facilitates digital asset transactions such as buying and selling properties, but it also facilitates the democratization of asset allocation. Unlike traditional asset markets, buying and selling digital tokens allows multiple investors to pool funds in the purchasing of a single asset. This makes it possible for smaller investors to enter a market that otherwise might be prohibitively expensive. </p><p>Aside from real estate and collectibles, the Avalanche Foundation envisions a wide array of use cases for tokenization on its blockchain. Per a blog post, these <a href=\"https://www.avax.network/blog/what-is-asset-tokenization-why-why-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">include</a> company equity, venture capital, debt instruments, intellectual property, and portfolio diversification. </p><p>According to the announcement, the Avalanche Vista fund will be used to <a href=\"https://www.avax.network/blog/avalanche-foundation-vista-asset-tokenization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">purchase</a> various tokenized assets on the Avalanche Blockchain:</p><p>“Avalanche Vista will consider assets across the full liquidity spectrum, including equity, credit, real estate, commodities, as well as those that are blockchain-native.”</p><p>As Cointelegraph recently reported, financial services and investment bank corporation Citi recently described the tokenization market as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/killer-use-case-citi-says-trillions-in-assets-could-be-tokenized-by-2030\">the next “killer use case” in crypto</a>. </p><p>The company also predicts the sector will reach a global market cap of $4-$5 trillion by 2030. In comparison, the tokenization market was <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/tokenization-market-76652221.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> worth approximately $2.3 billion in 2021.</p><p><em><strong><em><a href=\"https://mint.cointelegraph.com/?url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/avalanche-foundation-allocates-50m-investment-on-chain-asset-token-purchases&amp;utm_source=cointelegraph_com&amp;utm_medium=appendix&amp;utm_campaign=articles\">Collect this article as an NFT</a></em></strong><em> to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.</em></em></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
