In addition, another $1.5 billion in crypto was alleged by TRM to have been spent on darknets for illicit activities, while another $3.7 billion in crypto was lost in hacks or exploits.</p><p>In total, $9.04 billion in crypto were sent to all types of financial fraud schemes, as alleged by TRM Labs. Despite a collapse in cryptocurrency prices from the ongoing bear market, it appears that there has been no corresponding slowdown in crypto-related crime. The firm wrote:</p><blockquote>\"Investment fraud centers on the solicitation of funds for fraudulent investments or projects; these often involve fake initial coin offerings (ICOs), unregistered securities or fraudulent investment platforms. Investment fraud involving cryptocurrency rose by nearly 200% from USD 907 million in 2021 to USD 2.57 billion in 2022.\"</blockquote><p>Researchers said that ten of the largest crypto Ponzi and pyramid schemes accounted for around 54% of the total amount. Moreover, an alleged 40% of the total incoming volume of investment fraud schemes active in 2022 was on Tron, mostly via <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trc-20-usdt-circulation-surges-to-record-high\">Tether (USDT) issued on the blockchain</a>, compared to just 17% in 2021. </p><p>Two of the largest crypto Ponzi schemes prosecuted in 2022 were Forsage and Trade Coin Club. Forsage lured investors with the promise of high returns through Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain contracts, netting nearly $974 million in investors' money through two related entities. Meanwhile, Trade Coin Club claimed high returns through its cryptocurrency exchange, soliciting more than $295 million from over 100,000 investors before its collapse. Both firms have since been sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-06/5176084c-4010-411a-bc24-9a52bba6e130.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Crypto spending on darknet markets in 2022 | Source: TRM Labs</figcaption></figure><p><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trc-20-usdt-circulation-surges-to-record-high\">Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?</a></strong></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"law_decoded\"></template></p>\n                \n            "

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-stalls-short-term-holder-inflows-intensify/",
    "description": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflows of the short-term holders have intensified recently as the asset&#8217;s rally has come to a halt. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Showing Elevated Exchange Inflows According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders have recently made inflows equivalent to 1.28% of their entire supply. The &#8220;exchange inflow&#8221; here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors are depositing to centralized exchanges currently. Generally, investors deposit to these platforms for selling-related purposes, so whenever this metric&#8217;s value is high, it&#8217;s a possible sign that there is dumping going on in the market. Naturally, this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. The exchange inflow is usually defined for the entire market, but in the context of the current discussion, the focus is only on the inflows being made by the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs). The STHs make up one of the two major cohorts in the Bitcoin market (the other being the &#8220;long-term holders&#8221;), and they include all investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days ago. As their name already implies, these investors don&#8217;t tend to hold for too long, as they are usually the most fickle bunch in the market, easily selling at the sight of any FUD or profit-taking opportunities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Expect Retrace, Will BTC Move Against Crowd Once Again? Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflows specifically for the STHs over the last year or so. The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter Here, the exchange inflow of the STHs is represented as a percentage of their supply (that is, the sum of the wallet amounts that each individual STH is holding right now). From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator&#8217;s value had risen to notable values earlier in the month when the market was going through FUD like the SEC lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase. While the STHs were clearly showing panic then, the scale of their selling was still significantly lower than the other selloffs that have taken place during the past year. After the latest rally in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price above the $30,000 level has occurred, however, the indicator&#8217;s value has shown a sharp increase. Now, the metric has hit a value of 1.28%, which means that the STHs have recently made inflows equivalent to 1.28% of their supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode This level is higher than what was seen during the rebound rally back in March of this year. As is visible from the graph, the rally back then had hit the brakes when the STHs ramped up their selling. So far, Bitcoin has been trending sideways since the recent sharp price surge occurred. So it&#8217;s possible that the current intensified selling from the STHs is behind this trend, similar to how it was back in March. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,100, up 4% in the last week. BTC continues to hold above the $30,000 mark &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Maxim Hopman on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com"
