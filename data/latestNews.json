The Lamina1 CEO said it’s about challenging “corporate greed and control.” She added that with today’s technology, it’s now possible to “give more autonomy to creators across entertainment, gaming, commerce, fashion, and beyond to build, create, and distribute these worlds on their own.”</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/web3-gamer-mark-zuckerbergs-metaverse-losses-nft-game-discord-gods-unchained-hot-take/\"><strong><em>Web3 Gamer: Zuckerberg’s metaverse losses, NFT game on Discord, Gods Unchained hot take</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"defi_newsletter\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
