The lawyer emphasized the significance of this arrangement, particularly given that his fraud trial is scheduled to start in October.</p><p>Maintaining his innocence, SBF is confronted with <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-sbf-face-consequences-for-mismanaging-ftx-don-t-count-on-it\">allegations of masterminding an elaborate fraud scheme</a>, which involved unauthorized access to billions of dollars from FTX customer funds for personal use.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-seeks-175m-settlement-with-genesis-entities-to-resolve-dispute\"><strong><em>FTX seeks $175M settlement with Genesis entities to resolve dispute</em></strong></a></p><p>Prosecutors reportedly argued that unless Bankman-Fried promptly provides information about the advice he received and its origin, he should be precluded from introducing this defense during the trial, as per their contention.</p><p>The prosecutors reportedly mentioned their ability to provide Bankman-Fried with information on hard drives. These drives could be used on computers at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), where individuals await their trials. </p><p>However, due to limitations, not all the information can be stored on a laptop. A plan to move him for laptop access was denied by prison authorities. The Judge's decision on his requests is awaited ahead of the trial.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/deposit-risk-crypto-exchanges-money/\"><strong><em>Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?</em></strong></a></p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"crypto_biz\"></template></p>\n                \n            "
