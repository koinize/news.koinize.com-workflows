Bitcoin is slowly moving lower from the $43,800 resistance zone. The price is trading below $43,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $42,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $43,000 level. Bitcoin Price Takes Hit Bitcoin price made a fresh attempt to gain pace above the $43,200 level.
