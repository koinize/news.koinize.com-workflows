    "description": "Ethereum price faced resistance near $1,650 against the US Dollar. ETH corrected gains but the $1,620 support might spark another upward movement. Ethereum is eyeing a key upside break above the $1,650 resistance. The price is trading above $1,625 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $1,650 and $1,670. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum’s price was able to climb further above the $1,620 resistance. However, ETH struggled to gain strength for a move above the $1,650 resistance, like Bitcoin. There was a downside correction below the $1,630 level. The price even spiked below $1,620 but the downsides were limited. A low was formed near $1,613 and the price is now moving higher. There was a break above the $1,620 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,652 swing high to the $1,613 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,625 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,635 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,652 swing high to the $1,613 low at $1,642. The next resistance is near the $1,650 level. A close above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the $1,670 resistance. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com If there is a close above $1,670, the price might start a strong increase. The next major hurdle is near the $1,750 level. A close above the $1,750 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,880. Another Drop in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,620 level. The first key support is close to $1,610. The next key support is $1,585. A downside break below $1,585 might start another bearish wave.
