He had been making digital art for over a decade prior but had no way to attribute value to it. </p><p>When I saw all the press from the Beeple sale, I kind of brushed past the $69 million figure, that wasnt that interesting to me, but I do remember thinking, wait, somebody sold digital art, how does that work’, says Amadon.</p><p>I’ve been doing it for a decade but I got stuck in kind of no man’s land. I would make physical work but I liked making digital work more. My audience liked the digital work a lot more but there really wasn’t anything you could do with it in the art world. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-digital-disobedience\">Digital disobedience </h2><p>Amadon is a deep thinker and puts an incredible amount of effort into making his art purposeful. He also embraces much of the crypto ethos and believes those who are along for the ride are all in some way a little digital disobedient.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>I mean, if you’re in crypto, it’s because you’ve rejected something. You’ve rejected something in the financial world, you’re embracing sovereignty, you embrace self custody, self reliance. There’s some social element that you rejected, that got you here to begin with.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I think we’re really disrupting a lot of these existing structures. Were causing hell for a lot of gatekeepers. We’re opening up the doors for a lot of artists. None of us here are obeying what we’re supposed to be doing. </p><p>I feel like all of us really have embraced disobedience in a lot of ways because nobody in traditional finance wants you to think that crypto is valid. Nobody in the art world wants you to think crypto is valid. By virtue of us being here, we’re all disobedient if you look at what society has deemed normal and acceptable.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WAGMI-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"WAGMI by Patrick Amadon\" class=\"wp-image-25056\" width=\"490\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WAGMI-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium.jpeg 638w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WAGMI-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WAGMI-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium-100x100.jpeg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WAGMI by Patrick Amadon (SuperRare)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Art is a medium that Amadon values as a way to voice his passion for activism and for its ability to point out societal issues he cares about. He puts an incredible amount of effort into making his art have a purpose.</p><p>I like doing something that has a purpose for doing it. Often, I like using art as an outlet to comment on some socio-economic or political situation. Or cultural nuance or just something to needle the space a little bit, Amadon says. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>I think that the story of the narrative is the art and I think that the aesthetic is really just the voice that you tell it with. That’s why I think concept is kind of the most critical element of an art piece. It has to be saying something a lot of us can say the same thing. I mean, the aesthetic kind of becomes the voice of it again.</strong></p></blockquote><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-no-rioters-at-hong-kong-art-week\"><strong>‘No Rioters’ </strong>at<strong> Hong Kong Art Week </strong></h2><p>Embracing his digital disobedience and desire to use art for more than aesthetics, Amadon brazenly had his piece “<a href=\"https://superrare.com/0xbd01a31e5dfe6e03ab1bc2b39efcd958a228ad02/no-rioters-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >No Rioters</a>” displayed on a <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/protest-themed-artwork-censored-hong-kong-2274300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >giant digital billboard</a> above the Sogo Causeway Bay store during Hong Kong Art Week.</p><p>The glitch art is centered around a surveillance camera oscillating side to side but the primary provocation was showcasing the names and prion terms of activists in the pro-democracy movement from 2019. </p><div class=\"article-suggest\">      <div class=\"article-suggest__title display3\">Read also</div>      <div class=\"article-suggest__items\">                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bringing-contemporary-pop-art-to-an-nft-metaverse/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>Bringing contemporary pop art to an NFT metaverse</p>                        </a>                    </div>                    <div class=\"article-suggest__item\">                        <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/nft-communities-greenlight-web3-films-decentralized-future-fans-hollywood/\" class=\"article-suggest__subtitle display4\">                            <span>Features</span>                            <p>NFT communities greenlight Web3 films: A decentralized future for fans and Hollywood</p>                        </a>                    </div></div></div><p>It was a billboard the size of the city block in the middle of Hong Kong Art Week which is sponsored by the government. I thought, let’s be a little disobedient. Id followed the Hong Kong protest in 2019 pretty closely. I’ve been a news hawk since the dawn of the internet so I wanted to put up something to honor the protesters, says Amadon. </p><p>I put a giant security camera up there and then every 10th frame or so just flash protesters names, their sentences, and instances of the government beating up protesters, throwing them in jail. It’s all illegal under the Hong Kong national security law to put that in public and I had it on the biggest billboard in Hong Kong during Art Week for three straight days which was great.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NO RIOTERS, 2023.

You no longer need a brother, sister or cousin to be working at the <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Gagosian</a> to get a shot at selling physical and be sitting at the main table of the art world, Amadon says.</p><p>It’s really tough to participate in the art world if you’re coming from a marginalized community or from a third-world country. What we’ve done with the technology is we really have flattened the space tremendously and we’ve allowed people like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/osinachiart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Osinachi</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ix_shells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Ix Shells</a> to participate meaningfully in the art world that would have been very difficult to access before.

As an artist who is fascinated by the convergence of art and technology, Doppelganger explores what its like to link a nonfungible token to an array of art rather than point to a single image.</p><p>Because we’re just beginning to scratch the surface on what’s possible in digital art and what’s possible in digital art when it’s paired with smart contracts on the blockchain, I reached out to Transient Labs and had them build a token that points to an array instead of a token that points to a single link. Doppelganger was built on that.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Doppelganger-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Doppelganger by Patrick Amadon\" class=\"wp-image-25058\" width=\"498\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Doppelganger-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium.jpeg 640w, https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Doppelganger-by-Patrick-Amadon-Medium-300x275.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Doppelganger by Patrick Amadon (OpenSea)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The contract is artist-owned and essentially can include multiple images into one NFT.

They will never change and only the collector has control over what it points to. As the collector you get to select what art you’d like to be displayed. I think were up to around 12-13 different pieces right now. I’m going to add another very shortly. I’m just going to keep expanding it because I can keep adding to it, but I can never subtract from it, he says. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Doppelgnger now has 13 artworks you can select from.
