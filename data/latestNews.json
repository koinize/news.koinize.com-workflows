    "description": "<p>Crypto payments platform CoinsPaid believes North Korean Lazarus Group was behind the hack that saw $37 million stolen from the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The platform has restarted operations after halting them in the wake of the hack and has proposed a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group.&nbsp;</p>\nLazarus Group Behind Hack&nbsp;\n<p>CoinsPaid had halted all operations following the hack that hit the platform on the 22nd of July, with hackers stealing over $37 million. In a post published on the 26th of July, the company pointed at the dreaded Lazarus Group, accusing it of orchestrating the hack while announcing the resumption of processing services. The company stated in the post,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;On the 22nd of July, CoinsPaid experienced a hacker attack, resulting in the theft of USD 37.3M. We suspect Lazarus Group, one of the most powerful hacker organizations, is responsible. In response to the attack, the company&rsquo;s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward. Indeed, our security measures and procedures allowed CoinsPaid to prevent higher loss of funds.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Lazarus Group has become one of the most feared hacker organizations and has targeted some of the biggest companies in the world, including Sony, Alphapo, Atomic Wallet, Horizon Bridge, and Axie Infinity. The Axie Infinity hack alone saw the group steal a staggering $625 million.&nbsp;</p>\nCustomer Funds Secure&nbsp;\n<p>The post also confirmed that the platform had resumed operations in a new, secure, and limited environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;After the partial downtime, our services are getting up and running one by one in the new secured environment. We expect it to take a few more days to sort out minor details and ensure the system works smoothly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The firm assured users that their funds were safe. However, it acknowledged that the company&rsquo;s balance sheet had taken a considerable hit. Despite the loss, the company believes that Lazarus was hoping to extract a much larger sum from the platform, but the company&rsquo;s team of experts was able to thwart their attempts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We believe Lazarus expected the attack on CoinsPaid to be much more successful. In response to the attack, the company&rsquo;s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>CoinsPaid&rsquo;s preliminary investigation was assisted by blockchain security firms, including Match Systems, Chainalysis, and Crystal. CoinsPaid CEO Max Krupyshev stated,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;CoinsPaid will recover and continue delivering first-class innovative payment solutions despite the incident. We have no doubt the hackers won&rsquo;t escape justice.&rdquo;</p>\n\nRoundtable With Other Victims&nbsp;\n<p>According to the online coding platform GitHub, the Lazarus Group is actively targeting entities and users in the crypto and cybersecurity space. Cybersecurity platform Socket.Dev outlined how the hacker group targets users by compromising their accounts through Malware. According to Socket.Dev, the first point of contact are social media platforms such as WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just last month, Elliptic, a blockchain forensics firm, revealed that the group had managed to hack Atomic Wallet, with the platform losing around $100 million. Meanwhile, online crypto sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the Alphapo hack resulted in a loss of $60 million. The Alphapo hack also impacted CoinsPaid, as the two organizations are closely associated with one another. CoinsPaid revealed that it would be organizing a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group and launching an initiative to minimize such attacks in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Within a few weeks, CoinsPaid will organize a round table with all the Lazarus victims to announce a new initiative aimed at minimizing and preventing such attacks in the future. We urge Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitfinex, OKX, and others to participate in this vital process.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-ascendance-how-it-captured-pepe-investors-attention/",
    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) has been making headlines again with its recent price rally, causing a significant impact on the PEPE network and its investors. As the price of DOGE surged around mid-July, on-chain data indicates that investors began to abandon their holdings in PEPE, leading to a sharp decline in the network&#8217;s activity. Daily Active Addresses, a crucial metric used to gauge the level of network activity, took a hit during this period. On July 14, PEPE recorded 5,086 active users. However, by the close of July 25, that number had plummeted to a mere 1,999 daily dynamic addresses, representing a staggering 61% decline.  This abrupt drop in network usage suggests that many investors shifted their attention and funds towards DOGE, leaving PEPE behind. Related Reading: Polygon Warning Signs Point To Slide In MATIC Price On Support Breakdown PEPE daily active addresses. Source: Santiment Dogecoin Hype Leaves PEPE In The Dust The reason for this shift in investor behavior can be attributed to DOGE&#8217;s recent impressive performance in the market. Over the past seven days, DOGE saw a surge of 11.6%, reaching a price of $0.079, according to CoinGecko. DOGE also experienced a slight 0.7% climb in the past 24 hours.  Doge price in green in all timeframes. Source:  Coingecko The impact of the DOGE rally on PEPE also extended to its price. Within the same seven-day period, PEPE&#8217;s price declined 13%. The sell-off intensified as more investors shifted their focus to the meme-inspired DOGE, which enjoyed the spotlight as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies. ‘Meme Coin Magic’ While DOGE experienced a boost in its market cap, it wasn&#8217;t the only meme coin project to do so. Other projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ApeCoin (APE) also saw minor market cap increases. The surge in social volume for these meme coins typically signals an approaching peak, as enthusiasm and speculation surrounding these assets tend to drive their prices to unsustainable levels. Dogecoin market cap currently at $11.15 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Data analytics firm Santiment pointed out the market cap increases in DOGE, SHIB, and APE, attributing the rise to the &#8220;meme coin magic&#8221; that seems to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts periodically. Related Reading: Litecoin Bulls Barrel Back Toward $92 Level – Will They Succeed? Santiment also warned that high social volume spikes often indicate potential market tops, suggesting that the excitement around DOGE might reach its peak. 🐶 The week has kicked off with some #memecoin magic, as #Dogecoin, #ShibaInu, &#38; #Apecoin have enjoyed minor market cap rises. As is typically the case with these types of assets, high social volume spikes will signal tops. $DOGE excitement is heating up. https://t.co/Z0w3UXZDzz pic.twitter.com/h0mriBIpXh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 24, 2023 The recent DOGE price rally has not only attracted more attention to the cryptocurrency itself but has also caused a significant impact on other meme-inspired projects like PEPE. However, as the crypto market continues to be influenced by hype and social media trends, investors should remain cautious and vigilant to avoid falling prey to speculative manias.
