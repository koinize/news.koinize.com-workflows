However, the rally could not be sustained as <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-jubilant-over-grayscale-sec-decision-uncertainty-remains\">analysts cautioned that the victory</a> did not guarantee the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.</p><p>Still, the victory may prove to be bullish for Grayscale.

This shows that traders have maintained their focus on crypto-specific news.</p><p>Could bulls defend the support levels in Bitcoin and altcoins? Will that lead to a stronger recovery soon? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin’s range resolved to the upside with a sharp breakout on Aug. 29. This move indicates that the price is likely to oscillate inside the large range between $24,800 and $31,000 for a few days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/445ff3ef-e252-407e-985e-869c8bbbf86e.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

If they succeed, it will signal that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The BTC/USDT pair may first rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,689) and thereafter attempt a rally to $31,000.</p><p>If bears want to trap the aggressive bulls, they will have to pull the price below $26,833. If they do that, it will indicate that the bears are selling on every recovery attempt. The pair could then retest the strong support at $24,800.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) once again rebounded off the crucial support at $1,626 on Aug. 28, indicating that the bulls are buying the dips.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/874f7439-d7b8-404a-9334-17a764117a3a.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The momentum picked up on Aug. 29 and the bulls propelled the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,716). This suggests that the ETH/USDT pair could swing between $1,816 and $1,626 for some more time.</p><p>The price has turned back below the 20-day EMA on Aug. 30, signaling that bears have not yet given up. If the price maintains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could tumble to $1,626. Contrarily, if the price turns up and climbs back above the 20-day EMA, the pair may reach the overhead resistance at $1,816.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>After a tight range trading near $220 for a few days, BNB (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\">BNB</a>) surged higher on Aug.29. The relief rally is facing resistance at the 50-day SMA ($235) as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/ea22f8fb-1bad-4979-92d2-77f5b7ec678c.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA ($224) is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating that the downward selling pressure is reducing. If the price turns up from the current level, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the resistance line. This level may again attract aggressive selling by the bears.</p><p>On the downside, if the price slides below $220, it will indicate that the bears remain in control. The pair could then slump to the Aug. 22 intraday low of $203.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\">XRP</a>) has been trading between $0.50 and $0.56 for the past few days. This suggests that the bulls are buying near the support and the bears are selling close to the resistance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/4ae65077-f609-4371-8422-0d79ae9b2e40.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.55) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the bears have the upper hand. Sellers will try to sink the price below the strong support at $0.50. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair may plummet to $0.41.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $0.50, the pair may extend its stay inside the tight range for some more time. Buyers will have to shove and sustain the price above $0.56 to signal the start of a sustained recovery. The pair may then rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.64).</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>The bulls pushed Cardano (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\">ADA</a>) above $0.28 on Aug. 29 but they could not sustain the higher levels. That kept the price below the resistance at $0.28.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/48c149ce-4b51-44db-833e-7243ea41dcdd.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>This shows that the price remains stuck inside the range between $0.28 and $0.24. The next support is at the uptrend line. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, it will suggest that every minor dip is being purchased. That will enhance the prospects of a rally above $0.28. Above this level, the ADA/USDT pair could soar to $0.32.</p><p>Instead, if the price dives below the uptrend line, it will signal that the bears are trying to make a comeback. The pair could then skid to the vital support at $0.24.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\">DOGE</a>) reached the 20-day EMA ($0.07) on Aug. 29 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above it. </p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/989950b6-6570-45f5-9631-b3539cd33319.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. The DOGE/USDT pair may then consolidate between the 20-day EMA and the support at $0.06.</p><p>Alternatively, if the pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are maintaining their buying pressure. That could open the gates for a potential rally to $0.08.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana’s (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\">SOL</a>) recovery hit a roadblock at the 20-day EMA ($21.77) on Aug. 29 indicating that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/ef16c115-a596-4a63-9281-f2f6c2577eb3.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will once again try to tug the price to $19.35. If this level cracks, the SOL/USDT pair could start a downward move to $18 and then to $16.</p><p>The bulls are likely to have other plans. They will try to build upon the recovery by pushing the price above the overhead resistance at $22.30. If they can pull it off, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($23.59). If the price turns down from this level, the pair may remain range-bound between the 50-day SMA and $19.35 for some time.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-dogecoin-price-up-today\"><strong><em>Why is Dogecoin price up today?</em></strong></a></p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) soared above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern at $1.53 on Aug. 29. This signals a potential trend change.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/65ad0881-6ffa-416c-b280-af0ac83e95d0.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ALTCUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Typically, after the breakout, the price turns down and retests the break out level. If the price bounces off $1.53, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That could start an up-move toward the pattern target of $1.91. If this resistance is scaled, the TON/USDT pair could reach $2.07.</p><p>If the bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly sink the price back below $1.53. Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in a long liquidation. The pair may then slump to $1.25.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index\">DOT</a>) broke and closed above the 20-day EMA ($4.64) on Aug. 29 but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/442bfbcb-9472-4c72-bfe0-4d2a0a330218.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOTUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears have pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA on Aug. 30. This indicates that the bears have not given up and are viewing the recoveries as a selling opportunity. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory signal a possible range-bound action in the near term.</p><p>If the price breaks below $4.50, the DOT/USDT pair may swing between the 20-day EMA and $4.22 for some time. On the other hand, a break and close above the 20-day EMA could propel the pair to the overhead resistance at $5.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index\">MATIC</a>) is facing stiff resistance in the zone between $0.60 and $0.65 as seen from the long wick on the Aug. 29 candlestick.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/15e2afaa-5baa-41f7-af96-20a0eedf3ef4.png\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AMATICUSDT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The price turned down on Aug. 30, suggesting that the MATIC/USDT pair could consolidate in a large range between $0.51 and $0.65 for a while. The price action inside the range is likely to remain random and volatile.</p><p>If bears want to seize control, they will have to drag the price below $0.51. That could resume the downtrend with the next support at $0.45. On the upside, a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.67) could signal that the bulls are in the driver’s seat.</p><template data-name=\"subscription_form\" data-type=\"markets_outlook\"></template><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

While imperfect, it was a crucial move in the right direction for our industry and a signal to the U.S. that it will be left behind if it continues to stand still and rely on antiquated regulations.</p><p>Similar to how Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) took old technological, economic and financial concepts to build something new, regulators must rework existing regulatory and financial security frameworks to create a successful environment for participants. There are many useful and valid elements in our existing financial and regulatory frameworks.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-revolution-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies\"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</em></strong></a></p><p>On the other hand, there are many problems with the blockchain industry that the traditional regulatory framework does not address sufficiently — this leads to frustration and wasted resources as lawyers bicker over potential interpretations of statements instead of abiding by clearly defined legislation.</p><p>While Web3’s practical applications have shown great potential, it remains a remix of this traditional financial system — albeit a remix dedicated to improving efficiency, openness and fairness for all participants.</p><h2>MiCA: A necessary but mediocre step forward for regulation</h2><p>Despite the complex language around financial and securities regulations, the situation is really more simple than it appears. In short, our regulations attempt to prevent people from doing bad things to other people. Examples could include terrorists sending or receiving money to facilitate acts of terrorism or fraudsters making fraudulent claims to investors. It also includes ensuring that licensed individuals and entities are held accountable to a set of operating standards developed over the history of our modern financial markets.</p><p>In the more technical sense, the laws governing these operating standards are:</p><ol><li>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing laws</li><li>Securities and commodities laws</li><li>Market infrastructure regulation</li></ol><p>Despite the SEC’s insistence that existing regulations cover these three issues broadly, many elements manage to fall through the cracks of these roughly 100-year-old definitions, rules and penalties. We can largely attribute that problem to two things.</p><p>One is the categorization of digital assets. Are they commodities or securities, or do they fall under an entirely new category? Digital tokens often exhibit characteristics of one, both or neither, creating a significant dilemma for existing frameworks.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-08/b9050fc9-7500-4fd7-904d-80303011599e.jpg\"  /><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An overview of MiCA's key points. Source: Circle</em></figcaption></figure><p>The second is that the pace of innovation far outstrips the rate at which slow and sophisticated traditional finance regulatory frameworks can adapt. Governments have the responsibility of establishing regulations that are robust enough to prevent misconduct and protect stakeholders, yet flexible enough to accommodate the advancements promised by this burgeoning industry. How are these authorities supposed to compete with a smart contract that can be deployed in minutes and then upgraded that same day to have a completely different set of logic and parameters?</p><p>To those of us in this fast-moving industry, it is glaringly obvious that we need new regulations and guidelines that are compatible with the unique benefits and challenges Web3 offers.</p><p>MiCA constitutes one promising attempt, though the framework will struggle as the individual member-states of the EU test the framework in their native courts and build a patchwork example of cases with varied outcomes. That being said, here’s the good, the bad and the ugly of MiCA.</p><h2>MiCA: The good</h2><p>The best part of MiCA? Tighter rules and larger punishments for crypto asset service providers who lose customer funds! This is a longstanding issue within crypto where the exchanges and wallets have no liability when they are hacked or compromised and lose users’ funds, and has led to tens of billions of dollars lost with no options for users. This is unacceptable and has directly contributed to many individuals being irrevocably destroyed in our industry by bad actors.</p><h2>MiCA: The bad</h2><p>Although it states a primary goal of preventing market manipulation, the majority of manipulation is happening outside of the EU (via offshore entities), so it doesn’t really help many people directly. It may help indirectly, though, as it signals to the market the direction regulators are moving toward — though this also depends on the punishments levied when cases come to a judge.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-takeaways-from-the-european-union-s-mica-regulations\"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>3 takeaways from the European Union’s MiCA regulation</em></strong></a></p><p>Noticeably excluded are <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance\">decentralized finance</a> and future central bank digital currencies. Although it might be seen as a positive that DeFi is not included, the vast majority of on-chain transactions and activity are DeFi, and it is frustrating that this was skipped.</p><h2>MiCA: The ugly</h2><p>Unfortunately, there are many concerning or otherwise “ugly” elements present in MiCA that readers must be aware of, and not only if they’re EU citizens.</p><ul><li>The “Travel Rule” greatly increased the surveillance and recording of financial transactions and online activity in an unprecedented manner by forcing service providers to identify the recipient as well as the sender for every transaction.</li><li>A very low threshold of 1,000 euros for reporting leads to increased surveillance, as compared with the traditional threshold of $10,000 in the United States for banks. It’s irritating to have regular people be subjected to these Orwellian levels of scrutiny, given that the vast majority of financial malfeasance is done by larger banks and institutions via money laundering and other fraudulent activities.</li><li>It requires official approval from lawmakers before launching tokens or liquidity. This will dramatically stifle the number of legitimate projects launched within the EU, both directly and indirectly. It’s hard to assume that the queues will be short and the process expeditious — governments have proven time and time again that they are slow and inefficient, especially where new technologies are concerned.</li></ul><p>There’s another core problem inherent in any regulation by the European Union that bears repeating: The fragmented nature of the EU’s court system makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of individual future rulings. In short, this is a minor win for Web3 and requires much more work around the world by regulators. </p><p>This is in stark contrast to the U.S. court system, which is — traditionally, albeit not with Web3 — a unified and solid foundation of legal rulings. A fragmented series of rulings makes it very unlikely that other countries will really follow MiCA full-steam ahead; instead, they will likely wait for the U.S. to come out with its own substantial framework and regulatory guidelines.</p><p>Regulators, exchange operators and founders all say that until the U.S. has a substantial set of regulatory guidelines, they will be proceeding very cautiously and slowly. Although they may take some inspiration from MiCA, it is not the North Star they need.</p><p>The blockchain industry is at a crossroads, for both regulators and users.

Meanwhile, defunct crypto lending firm BlockFi has applied to a court to request the transfer of “trade-only” assets from its users’ accounts into stablecoins to allow individuals to withdraw them. Shibarium, the new layer-2 blockchain launched by the developers of Shiba Inu <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index\">(SHIB)</a> has reached a new wallet and transaction milestone just hours after relaunching its bridge to the public.</p><h3>Judge dismisses class-action lawsuit against Uniswap</h3><p>Decentralized exchange Uniswap was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-dismisses-class-action-suit-against-uniswap-over-token-scam-losses\">vindicated from a class-action lawsuit</a> after a judge showed rare understanding of the DeFi marketplace and how it operated. </p><p>Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York dismissed claims of fraud brought forward by six plaintiffs. </p><p>The lawsuit was filed in April 2022 on behalf of a “nationwide class of users.” Plaintiffs claimed that Uniswap Labs controlled liquidity pools, including those created by scammers who launched fake tokens on the DEX. The judge claimed that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants knew the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-binance-ceo-warns-of-phishing-scams-as-uniswap-founder-gets-hacked\">identities of the scammers</a>. Instead of suing the scammers, the plaintiffs were suing the defendants over statements made on social media.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Big Lesson for crypto policymakers and financial regulators (and the administrative state at large):<br><br>If you choose to avoid the legal process, if you do not want to engage in good faith rulemaking, the courts will not bail you out. <a href=\"https://t.co/r5RATmiwwq\">https://t.co/r5RATmiwwq</a></p>&mdash; Mike Wawszczak (@mikewawszczak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikewawszczak/status/1696912680173674971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>“The Court declines to stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged, and concludes that Plaintiffs’ concerns are better addressed to Congress than to this Court,” Failla’s order read.</p><h3>BlockFi asks court for permission to convert trade-only assets into stablecoins</h3><p>Defunct crypto lending firm BlockFi has applied to a court to request the transfer of “trade-only” assets from its users’ accounts into stablecoins to allow individuals to withdraw them. The request marks another step toward the return of users’ funds, a process that the company began in August. </p><p>On Aug. 29, BlockFi filed an application to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey to authorize the conversion of the so-called trade-only assets into stablecoins. The assets in question — Algorand’s native token,</p><p>ALGO — cannot be withdrawn easily, and BlockFi suggests a one-time exchange for Gemini Dollar (GUSD) or another stablecoin.</p><p>According to the application, the amount of trade-only assets doesn’t exceed 0.5% of all U.S. wallet assets of BlockFi users. Other trade-only assets, such as Cardano </p><p>ADA, Solana , Avalanche AVAX and others, are being separately held by BlockFi International.</p><p>The committee of BlockFi creditors, recognized by the court, supported the company’s request.</p><p>In 2022, BlockFi became one of several companies that sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S., along with FTX, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. In November 2022, it temporarily stopped clients from withdrawing funds. On Aug. 16, the court authorized the company to open withdrawals for the first time in nine months.</p><p>The court has also conditionally approved BlockFi’s restructuring plan. The company prioritizes recovering funds from entities including Alameda Research, FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Emergent and Core Scientific. On Aug. 21, BlockFi’s legal team tried to block attempts by FTX to retrieve hundreds of millions of dollars to pay back its creditors.</p><p>According to estimates from April 2023, BlockFi owed up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors, including $1 billion to its three largest creditors and $220 million to bankrupt crypto hedge fund 3AC.</p><h3>SEC’s first deadlines for 7 Bitcoin ETF approvals coming up fast</h3><p>Over the next six days, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-decisions-on-seven-bitcoin-etfs-in-six-days\">facing initial deadlines</a> to decide on seven spot Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) exchange-traded funds coming after its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit\">court defeat</a> to Grayscale Investments.</p><p>The SEC's first deadline to inform investment firm Bitwise on the fate of its ETF will come on Sept. 1.

    "description": "On-chain data shows the number of Cardano (ADA) long-term holders has increased by 170% during the past twelve months. Cardano &#38; Litecoin Have Seen Most Growth In Long-Term Holders In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed data related to the long-term holders of the various assets in the sector. The &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs) here refer to all those investors who bought their coins at least one year ago. These HODLers are generally the most committed hands in the market, as they rarely participate in any selling. This cohort doesn&#8217;t usually budge even when FUD has taken over the market or an enticing profit-taking opportunity has appeared. Because they keep their coins locked away for long periods, the LTHs can naturally affect the economics of any cryptocurrency (although their effects don&#8217;t appear during the short term). Related Reading: Renowned Economist Explains Why Grayscale’s Win Is Not Good For Bitcoin Price Now, here is an infographic from IntoTheBlock that shows the total number of LTH addresses present on the networks of some of the top assets in the sector, as well as their percentage changes during the past year: Looks like Chainlink is the only one who has observed a decline in this metric &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock As displayed above, the number one ranked cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), currently has 33.6 million LTH addresses, reflecting an increase of 17.6% during the past twelve months. Despite its lower market cap, Ethereum (ETH) has BTC beat in this metric, as the number of LTHs on the chain is, interestingly, around 73.9 million, more than double what BTC has. The network has also observed a sharper growth in this indicator at about 44.2%. This is also even though Bitcoin is also much older, meaning that it would have been able to accumulate more LTHs over the years in the form of lost coins, as such addresses would also fall under this category (although they certainly don&#8217;t carry the same meaning as an investor willingly choosing to HODL). While these largest coins have seen some decent increases in the number of LTHs, Litecoin (LTC) has them very easily beaten with its 100% growth, implying that HODLers on the blockchain have doubled during the past year. LTC is still far behind in terms of the pure number of LTHs, as the network hosts just 4.9 million. Cardano, however, has complete victory over even LTC&#8217;s rapid growth, as the coin has seen LTHs go up by more than 170% in this period. This astonishing rise has taken ADA&#8217;s total HODLer count to 2.65 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Netflow Remains Negative Chainlink (LINK) appears to be the only cryptocurrency in the table that has seen an adverse change in its number of LTHs, as the asset&#8217;s HODLers have decreased by about 3%. The strong increases in the indicator for Cardano and Litecoin can naturally be constructive signs for their prices, as it shows an increasing tendency among the investors to hold onto their tokens for extended periods. ADA Price Cardano has failed to hold onto its gains from the latest rally, as the asset&#8217;s price has already fallen towards the $0.26 level.

    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-poised-for-bullish-breakout-inverted-hammer-formation-signals-rise-above-0-8-resistance/",
    "description": "After the initial excitement surrounding Ripple Lab’s partial legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subsided, XRP experienced a decline that led it to test its 4-month support line at $0.4240.  However, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated resilience by reclaiming its important psychological level of $0.50 and reentering its previous consolidation or accumulation zone. This renewed stability has sparked optimism among bullish investors, indicating a potential rebound for XRP. Presently, XRP is trading at $0.5295 with a 24-hour trade volume of $1,419,623,015.56. This reflects a 1.89% increase in price over the last 24 hours and a 1.60% increase over the past 7 days.  These gains and a promising chart formation suggest that XRP may be poised for further growth in the days and months ahead. Potential XRP Breakout As 2-Month Candle Nears Conclusion Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, known for insightful market analysis, recently took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight an intriguing development in the XRP market.  Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond As the two-month candle for XRP draws to a close, it displays the potential formation of an inverted hammer pattern. For further context, the inverted hammer is a technical analysis candlestick pattern that typically appears at the end of a downtrend. It is characterized by a small body at the candle&#8217;s upper end, with a long upper shadow and little to no lower shadow. The inverted hammer pattern suggests a potential reversal in price direction. It indicates that buyers have stepped in after a period of selling pressure, causing the price to bounce back from its lows.  As seen in Egrag’s chart above, throughout 426 days, XRP has demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining its market structure and solidifying its foundation amidst market fluctuations. On this note, Egrag further claimed: The chart unequivocally illustrates this trend, consistent with my earlier analyses wherein I underlined the significance of the 0.80c mark as a pivotal macro resistance level. Establishing this price range as a foundation marks a highly bullish macro stance.  Notably, per the information compiled by the analyst, this consolidation around the mentioned price range indicates a highly bullish macro stance for XRP Egrag Crypto predicts a scenario where the upcoming candle could propel XRP towards the $2.3 range. However, this achievement would merely serve as a stepping stone within a larger macro range of $3.3 to $5.5, signaling a seamless continuation of XRP&#8217;s upward trajectory. Egrag Crypto&#8217;s symbolic reference to Valhalla beyond the $5.5 threshold reflects the analyst&#8217;s belief in the substantial potential for XRP&#8217;s future growth. While these words evoke a sense of grandeur, they emphasize the possibility of XRP reaching unprecedented heights in the market. Amidst growing anticipation within the crypto community, all eyes are on the impending conclusion of the two-month candle, which holds the key to a potential breakout indicated by the inverted hammer formation.  Related Reading: Binance To Delist Eight BUSD Trading Pairs Soon, End Full BUSD Support By 2024 This pivotal moment raises questions about whether the cryptocurrency and the broader market are on the cusp of another upward trend, supported by favorable macro conditions, or if they will face a test of lower resistance levels again.
